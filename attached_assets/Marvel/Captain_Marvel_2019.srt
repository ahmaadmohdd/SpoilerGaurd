00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:35,796
Thank you Stan

00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:41,092
Sub by darelik

3
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:13,272
You know what time it is?

4
00:02:13,762 --> 00:02:15,009
Can't sleep.

5
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,262
There are terms for that.

6
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:50,198
Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

7
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,670
Dreams again.

8
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:57,877
Wanna fight?

9
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:03,132
I slipped.

10
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:06,085
Right, you slipped. As a result of me punching you in the face.

11
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:07,888
I was already slipping
when you happen to punch

12
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:09,680
me in the face.
The two of those are not related.

13
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:12,425
Tell me about this dream.

14
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:15,011
Anything new?

15
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,229
No.

16
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,468
Let go of the past.

17
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:23,737
I remember my past.

18
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,916
It's causing you doubt.

19
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:27,078
And doubt makes you vulnerable.

20
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:36,195
Control it.

21
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,532
Lose control again and you'll have to
commune with the Supreme Intelligence.

22
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:44,486
There's nothing more dangerous
in a warrior than emotion.

23
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,563
Humor is a distraction.

24
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,317
Anger.

25
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,027
Anger really serves the enemy.

26
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:08,969
<i>120 days elapsed from the T</i>

27
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,308
Has anyone ever seen what the Supreme
Intelligence really looks like?

28
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:17,452
No one can look upon a Supreme
Intelligence in its true form

29
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,159
You know that.

30
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,994
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us

31
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,330
So it's sacred.

32
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:26,678
It's personal.

33
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,957
No Kree divulges it.

34
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:29,036
Ever.

35
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:30,232
Who do you see?

36
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,472
Your brother.

37
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,073
No.

38
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:32,945
Father.

39
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,341
No.

40
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,361
Your old commander.

41
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:35,572
Vers.

42
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:36,937
It's me you see, isn't it?

43
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,576
I see what you're trying to do.

44
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:40,579
Is it working?

45
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:41,458
Yes.

46
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,482
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

47
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:44,684
What is the point

48
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,873
of giving me these

49
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,192
if you don't want me to use them.

50
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:48,901
I want you to use them.

51
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:51,361
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me the responsibility

52
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:52,316
of showing you

53
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,131
<i>how to use them.</i>

54
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:54,697
I know how

55
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:56,778
If that were true you could've
knocked me down with them.

56
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,633
Control your impulses.

57
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:04,054
Stop using this and start using this.

58
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
(It's) on you

59
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,431
To be the best version of yourself.

60
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,701
Vers.

61
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,915
Intelligence.

62
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:56,860
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

63
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:57,846
I am.

64
00:05:58,556 --> 00:05:59,222
You struggle.

65
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:00,952
with your emotions.

66
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:03,733
With your past, which fuels them.

67
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:09,223
You were just one victim
of the Skrull expansion

68
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:11,247
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

69
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:15,269
Impostors who silently infiltrate

70
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:17,533
and take over our planets.

71
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:21,397
Horrors that you remember

72
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,421
and so much that you do not.

73
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:27,986
It's all

74
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:29,342
blank.

75
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:30,613
My life.

76
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:32,963
You're supposed to take the form of

77
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,371
who I most admire.

78
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,395
But I don't even remember

79
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:38,574
who this person was to me.

80
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,226
Perhaps this is a mercy.

81
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:43,115
Sparing you from a deeper pain.

82
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:45,117
Freeing you

83
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,141
to do what all Kree must.

84
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,120
Put your people's needs before your own.

85
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,300
We've given you a great gift.

86
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:55,689
The chance to fight for
the good of all Kree.

87
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,259
I want to serve.

88
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:00,283
Then master yourself.

89
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:02,307
What was given can be taken away.

90
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,400
I won't let you down.

91
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:10,424
We'll know soon enough.

92
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:12,607
You have a mission.

93
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,543
Serve well and with honor.

94
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:39,011
This can't be good.

95
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:40,647
Must be another Skrull attack.

96
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,653
If it is, it's big.

97
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,995
Has the Skrull ever simmed you?

98
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:45,854
Once.

99
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,915
It was deeply disturbing.

100
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,441
Why?

101
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,546
Because I started into the
face of our mortal enemy

102
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,857
And the face staring back was my own.

103
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,196
Maybe if they were more attractive

104
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,715
Then it would be less disturbing.

105
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,075
You think you're funny

106
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:58,307
I'm not laughing

107
00:07:58,332 --> 00:07:59,249
You never laugh.

108
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:00,156
I laugh.

109
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:01,283
On the inside.

110
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:03,645
I'm not doing it now.

111
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,223
It's funny coz objectively speaking

112
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,454
you're quite handsome.

113
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:07,353
Why, thank you.

114
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:08,373
Listen up team.

115
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:09,477
Knock it off.

116
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:10,714
Right.

117
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:12,389
Prepare

118
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:13,403
for

119
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:16,732
a Search and Rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr.

120
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:20,510
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

121
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,921
This time, Torfa

122
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:25,961
Soh-Larr sent us a warning,
the signal was intercepted

123
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,985
and his cover's blown.

124
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:32,316
The Skrull General Talos have
sent kill units to find him.

125
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,259
Should they reach him before we do

126
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:36,433
the intelligence he's
acquired over three years

127
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:37,759
is as good as theirs.

128
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:42,626
The accusers will bomb a Skrull
stronghold here in the south.

129
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,713
We slip in,

130
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:45,737
we locate Soh-Larr,

131
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,138
then we get out

132
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:48,591
leaving them none the wiser.

133
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,170
The Torfa populace

134
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:53,259
We are not to interfere
with them nor them with us.

135
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:57,107
Nothing compromises the
security of our mission.

136
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:59,131
Proceed with caution.

137
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:01,155
Follow protocol before extracting him.

138
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,261
This is a dangerous mission.

139
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:07,179
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

140
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,018
if that is our fate today.

141
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:10,702
For the good of all Kree

142
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:12,726
<i>For the good of all Kree!</i>

143
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:22,531
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

144
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:26,159
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, <i>(find the diversion?)</i>

145
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,227
Locals on the periphery.

146
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:49,533
Maybe a dozen.

147
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:50,710
Minn-Erva.

148
00:10:52,457 --> 00:10:53,997
Do you read me?

149
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:55,400
Anybody copy?

150
00:10:58,107 --> 00:10:59,034
Damn.

151
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:11,730
His beacon's coming from that temple.

152
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,404
- Let's move.
- No.

153
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:15,475
This is a perfect spot for an ambush.

154
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Only one way in.
Only one way out.

155
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:18,630
We can get past the locals.

156
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:20,070
We don't know if they are locals.

157
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:21,517
Too risky.

158
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,654
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

159
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,966
No, you won't.

160
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,494
Right.

161
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:30,772
We keep a close radius.

162
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:32,796
We lose comms, meet me back at the helio.

163
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:34,570
Come on.

164
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:49,140
Att-Lass, you getting this?

165
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:50,538
Copy. I see them.

166
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:01,226
Get back!

167
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,505
Commander!

168
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:11,574
Back.

169
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,515
Back!

170
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,592
Minn-Erva

171
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:16,616
Do you have eyes on this?

172
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,357
Get back.

173
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:19,283
Minn-Erva!

174
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,148
Does anybody copy?

175
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,160
I don't wanna hurt you.

176
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:30,913
Move back.

177
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:34,934
Stay back!

178
00:12:39,118 --> 00:12:40,152
They're locals.

179
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,185
I found two dead.

180
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,209
No grave.

181
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,711
They're just starving.

182
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:10,387
HGX-78

183
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:11,909
2RT-7-9

184
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,933
AXX

185
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:17,675
Get back.

186
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,224
Skrulls!

187
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,214
Vers!

188
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:10,150
Incoming!

189
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:23,354
How did you know

190
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,609
the code?

191
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,098
How 'bout I tell you my secret

192
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,783
when you tell me yours?

193
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,244
Let's open her up!

194
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:49,789
Where

195
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:51,813
are we? (S??)

196
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:55,258
Where's your head at?

197
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:57,534
In the clouds.

198
00:14:57,558 --> 00:14:58,558
Where's yours?

199
00:14:58,582 --> 00:14:59,582
On my shoulders?

200
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:02,041
'Bout to show these boys how we do it!

201
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:03,065
You ready?

202
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:05,289
Hired for disaster, baby!

203
00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:06,313
That's right.

204
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,640
<i>This can't be right.</i>

205
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:20,076
<i>Go back even further</i>

206
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:25,665
You're too fast!

207
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:26,889
You need to go slow!

208
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:41,783
<i>Who is this person?</i>

209
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:42,750
<i>Are, are we in the right...</i>

210
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,389
What the hell do you think you're

211
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:45,420
You don't belong out here!

212
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,623
<i>I think we went back too far</i>

213
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,962
You let him drive.

214
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:48,986
Let me drive, (Santa? lol)

215
00:15:58,113 --> 00:15:59,382
<i>You're not strong enough!</i>

216
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,406
<i>You'll kill yourself.</i>

217
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:06,172
<i>DAMN!</i>

218
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,422
They'll never let you fly.

219
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,709
<i>Uh, am I the only one that's confused here?</i>

220
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,856
You're an AC(?) pilot.

221
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,495
But you're too emotional.

222
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,921
You do know why they call you cockpit

223
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:17,743
don't you?

224
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,871
Huge rumble,
throughout the cosmos shook the moon.

225
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:30,466
and the sun, the stars in the sky.

226
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:33,299
And so, they (well all) away.

227
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:34,723
Through up throughout the night

228
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:35,908
Did you see that?

229
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:37,024
Star ?bright?

230
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,507
Get your butts inside. It's time to eat.

231
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:42,531
Prepare for take off, Lieutenant Trouble.

232
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:44,555
Woohoo!
<i>Charming memory.</i>

233
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,041
<i>Hang on.</i>

234
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,621
<i>I think I got it.</i>

235
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,179
Goose likes you.

236
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:54,462
She doesn't typically take to people.

237
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:55,877
Early start to your morning?

238
00:16:55,902 --> 00:16:57,407
Ahh, late night actually.

239
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:59,431
I can't sleep when there's work to do.

240
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:00,551
Sound familiar?

241
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,575
Flying airplanes never feels like work.

242
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,257
Wonderful view, isn't it?

243
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,320
I prefer the view from up there.

244
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:08,791
You'll get there soon enough, ace.

245
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:10,110
<i>Wait, wait, wait. That's her.</i>

246
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:10,931
<i>Get it back.</i>

247
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:11,728
<i>Stand by.</i>

248
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:17,797
Sound familiar?

249
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:19,123
Wonderful view, isn't it?

250
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:22,943
I prefer the view from up there.

251
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:24,727
You'll get there soon enough, ace.

252
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,751
<i>What's that on her shirt?
I couldn't make it.</i>

253
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,368
Wonderful view, isn't it?

254
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,772
I prefer the view from up there.

255
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:36,796
You'll get there soon enough, ace.
<i>Focus</i>

256
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Excuse me?
<i>Look down</i>

257
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:40,880
<i>Focus!</i>

258
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:42,168
<i>Pegasus.</i>

259
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,724
<i>Doctor Wendy Lawson, that's her!</i>

260
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:46,748
Do you hear that?
<i>Do we have a location?</i>

261
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:49,793
<i>Got it.</i>

262
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,704
<i>Now track Lawson until we
find the energy signature.</i>

263
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,020
<i>Interesting.</i>

264
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:01,227
<i>Unh.</i>

265
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,648
<i>Hold on.</i>

266
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:04,845
<i>Go back right before this.</i>

267
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:06,869
<i>Go back.</i>

268
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:09,571
There's no beep flashing.
<i>That's it</i>

269
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:11,244
<i>Now let's see where you're headed.</i>

270
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,793
<i>That's it. Look at the coordinates.</i>

271
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,430
<i>Focus!</i>

272
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:19,362
<i>Open please.</i>

273
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:20,938
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

274
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:21,963
<i>Almost there.</i>

275
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:23,987
<i>?Almost there? Don't fight.</i>

276
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,496
<i>Focus!</i>

277
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,140
<i>Get her back. Get her back, now!</i>

278
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,053
Do we have

279
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:55,404
any information we can act on?

280
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:58,430
Just that Lawson was somewhere
on planet C-53

281
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:00,119
We're on our way.

282
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:01,887
Then dig, dig, dig, dig deeper.

283
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:05,336
Lawson is our link
to that Lightspeed engine!

284
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:09,412
Everything we're after.

285
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,001
Oh!

286
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:19,022
I'm gettin' something.

287
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:20,725
Try that again.

288
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:33,489
Not yet!

289
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:44,830
What did you do to me?

290
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:46,854
Now, we're just after a little information.

291
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:48,878
What did you put in my head?

292
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,902
Nothing that wasn't already there.

293
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,157
But those aren't my memories.

294
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:55,986
Shiiiit, it's like a bad trip in there

295
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,010
I'm not surprise you
can't keep it straight.

296
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,770
They really did a number on you.

297
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:02,220
Enough of your mind games.

298
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,244
What do you want?

299
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:08,524
We're looking for the location of a Dr. Lawson

300
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:09,966
and her Lightspeed engine.

301
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,991
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

302
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:14,958
Then why is she in your head?

303
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,832
?Figured would? happen to know how
these things come off, would you?

304
00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:50,302
No?

305
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:51,326
Fine.

306
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:58,595
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

307
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,259
Hey!

308
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:31,363
You do know why they call you...

309
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:51,074
Leaving so soon?

310
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:53,098
We're just getting to know each other!

311
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:17,709
Vers to Starforce Command

312
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,120
Do you read me?

313
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,043
Hello?

314
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:23,629
Do you copy?

315
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,233
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

316
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:56,598
Is this C-53?

317
00:24:58,757 --> 00:24:59,914
Do you understand me?

318
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:01,617
Is my universal translator working?

319
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:04,066
Yup. I understand you.

320
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,112
Oh, good.

321
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,568
Are you in charge of
security for this district?

322
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:12,028
Sort of. No.
The movie theater has it's own guy.

323
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:15,647
Where can I find communication equipment?

324
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
Thank you.

325
00:25:56,275 --> 00:25:58,351
Track the pod, find the girl.

326
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:02,072
She knows more than she knows.

327
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:04,958
Hey!

328
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,084
This one's taken.

329
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:19,942
Come on.

330
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:21,318
Vers.

331
00:26:21,343 --> 00:26:22,543
Vers.

332
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:25,490
Verify. CTC-39.

333
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:26,854
GRXC-16 hundred.

334
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,671
I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

335
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:30,636
Is everyone okay? What happened?

336
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:31,917
Skrull ambush.

337
00:26:32,262 --> 00:26:34,012
I thought we lost you.

338
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:35,459
Did you find Soh-Larr?

339
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:36,772
It wasn't Soh-Larr.

340
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:39,150
Talos simmed him. Even knew his code.

341
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,839
That's impossible.

342
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:43,366
That code was buried in his unconscious.

343
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:44,831
Skrulls messed with my mind.

344
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:45,952
The machine that they used.

345
00:26:45,977 --> 00:26:48,339
I...I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

346
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,237
Vers, where are you?

347
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:51,531
I'm on planet C-53.

348
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,664
The Skrulls are looking
for someone named Lawson.

349
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:55,147
<i>Who?</i>

350
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:56,935
She's...

351
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,113
who I...see.

352
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:00,432
<i>She's what?</i>

353
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,220
<i>Vers.</i>

354
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:04,927
Vers. What?

355
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,653
She's a scientist.

356
00:27:07,678 --> 00:27:09,678
They think that she's cracked
the code on Lightspeed tech.

357
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:11,138
I have to get to her before they do

358
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,822
or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.

359
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:13,425
No.

360
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,957
You've been caught once already.

361
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,624
How far is C-53?

362
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:20,267
Closest jump point is 22 hours.

363
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:23,176
Vers, hold your position
until we get there.

364
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:24,868
Keep your comms online so we can contact...

365
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,718
No! What if they got ahold of her before...

366
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:27,951
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

367
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:29,975
<i>The long distance company (?)</i>

368
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,657
<i>(?)...for the number you have dialed.</i>

369
00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:32,382
Vers.

370
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,409
<i>Please (?) your call</i>
Vers.
<i>with the (?) code</i>

371
00:27:35,676 --> 00:27:36,707
Vers!

372
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,560
If the Skrulls got to
her, she's compromised.

373
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:42,318
She's stronger than you think.

374
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:45,403
Ever been to C-53?

375
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:46,915
Once.

376
00:27:48,187 --> 00:27:50,129
It's a real shithole.

377
00:28:10,284 --> 00:28:11,954
Did you call us here?

378
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:29,133
<i>Beacon activated.</i>

379
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,468
'Scuse me, miss.

380
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:34,492
You know anything about a lady

381
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,025
blowing a hole through the roof

382
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,050
of that Blockbuster over there?

383
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:41,291
Witness says,
"She was dressed for laser tag."

384
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:43,439
Oh..

385
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:46,159
Yeah, I think she went that way.

386
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,428
Uhh...

387
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:49,602
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

388
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:53,527
Maybe, give me the 4-1-1
on the late night dropbox.

389
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:56,794
Could I see some identification please?

390
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,353
Vers. Kree Starforce.

391
00:28:58,378 --> 00:29:00,756
We don't carry our
identification on little cards.

392
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:01,777
Vers!

393
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:04,036
Star-Force

394
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:07,051
How long you plan to be in town?

395
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:08,283
Oh, I'll be out of your hair

396
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:11,192
soon as I drag down the Skrulls
that are infiltrating your planet

397
00:29:12,193 --> 00:29:13,588
Skrulls?

398
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:15,134
Shapeshifters.

399
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:18,200
They could transform to any
lifeform down to the DNA.

400
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:20,370
Oh boy.

401
00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:21,695
You boys don't have
any clue do you?

402
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,624
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

403
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:27,097
How do we know

404
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:28,857
you're, not one of those

405
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,375
shapeshifters?

406
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,052
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

407
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:34,058
You've finally asked a relevant question.

408
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:37,157
Oh! Congratulations to you, Starforce lady!

409
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:38,762
You're under arrest.

410
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,118
Rook!

411
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:50,818
<i>Rook! Let's roll!</i>

412
00:29:59,894 --> 00:30:01,468
Did you see that weapon?

413
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:02,332
I did not.

414
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:13,140
<i>Hey!</i>

415
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:47,886
Suspect on northbound train

416
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:49,111
in pursuit.

417
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,734
Trust me, true believer.

418
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,212
Trust me...

419
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:19,694
<i>Trust me, true believer.</i>

420
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:42,109
Ooooo hhhh......

421
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:04,827
Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.

422
00:33:06,974 --> 00:33:09,165
Let's greet them at the station.

423
00:33:20,586 --> 00:33:22,870
Mr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson.

424
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:25,805
Uhm. Uh, I'm still here at the Blockbuster.

425
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:27,066
And uh...

426
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,510
Where'd everybody go?

427
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:31,489
I've finished collecting evidence.

428
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,172
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity.

429
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:10,546
Stay back.

430
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:00,616
Nice scuba suit.

431
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,804
Lighten up, honey, huh?

432
00:36:07,856 --> 00:36:09,564
Got a smile for me?

433
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,578
All life on Earth

434
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:36,771
is carbon-based

435
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:38,221
Not this guy

436
00:36:38,252 --> 00:36:40,395
Whatever he runs on

437
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:42,369
is not on the periodic table.

438
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,145
You're saying he's not from around here.

439
00:36:46,186 --> 00:36:47,514
Yeah. How's your eye?

440
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,312
I'd say fine.

441
00:36:50,637 --> 00:36:53,055
But it can't believe what it's seeing.

442
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:56,747
You said

443
00:36:57,655 --> 00:36:59,750
this thing looked like

444
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:00,589
Coulson

445
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:02,392
Talked like him too

446
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:04,803
That woman said that there were...

447
00:37:04,828 --> 00:37:05,703
...more?

448
00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:07,398
The word she used was infiltration.

449
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:08,798
You believe her?

450
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:10,323
Not 'til I saw this?

451
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:13,380
What's your plan?

452
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,479
To find Blockbuster hero.

453
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:18,387
I got word on a motorcycle thief

454
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:20,037
that fits her description.

455
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:23,000
If she can tell us why
these lizards are here

456
00:37:23,397 --> 00:37:25,927
maybe she can tell us how
to kick 'em to the kerb.

457
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:26,897
Good.

458
00:37:28,025 --> 00:37:29,557
Do it alone though.

459
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,363
We can't trust anyone.

460
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,398
Not even our own men.

461
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:35,052
Yes, sir.

462
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,318
Wow!

463
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:52,006
They are ugly bastards, aren't they?

464
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:55,942
Yeah, well. He's no Brad Pitt, sir.

465
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:03,809
Safe journey to the beyond, my friend.

466
00:38:05,272 --> 00:38:06,536
I will

467
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
finish what we started.

468
00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:18,423
I wouldn't get too close there, boss.

469
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,315
No one in or out.

What can I get 'cha?

486
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:27,704
Where was this photograph taken?

487
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:29,764
I dunno, an airport?

488
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,175
Where's Pegasus?

489
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,557
That's classified.

490
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:36,228
Not unlike the file I started on you.

491
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:40,561
But I see you changes(?)
up a bit since then.

492
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:42,717
Grunge is a good look for you.

493
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,366
Did you have a rough day, Agent Fury?

494
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:45,349
Is cool.

495
00:39:45,374 --> 00:39:46,439
You know.

496
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:47,846
Had a space invasion.

497
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:49,125
Big car chase.

498
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:52,080
Got to watch in an alien autopsy.

499
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,482
Typical 9 to 5.

500
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:55,680
So you saw one.

501
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:58,406
I was never one to believe in aliens.

502
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:01,146
But I can't unsee that.

503
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,440
This is getting a little awkward
but, I gotta ask.

504
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:06,599
You think I'm one of those green things.

505
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:08,200
Can't be too careful.

506
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:09,860
You are looking at

507
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:12,877
100% red-blooded Earth man.

508
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:14,622
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

509
00:40:14,784 --> 00:40:17,192
Are we talking cheek swab or urine sample?

510
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:18,985
No. The DNA will match.

511
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,092
Want my AOL password?

512
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,930
Skrulls can only sim recent
memories for host bodies.

513
00:40:22,955 --> 00:40:24,543
Oh. Ho-ho.

514
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:27,032
You wanna get personal.

515
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,276
-Where were you born?
<i>-Huntsville, Alabama</i>

516
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,607
Technically, I don't remember that part.

517
00:40:30,632 --> 00:40:31,911
Name of your first pet.

518
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:33,086
-Mr. Snoopers
<i>-Mr. Snoopers?</i>

519
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,059
That's what I said.

520
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:34,855
Did I pass?

521
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,047
Not yet. First job?

522
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:37,957
Soldier. Straight outta high school.

523
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:39,813
Left the ranks a full bird colonel.

524
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:40,206
<i>-Then?</i>
-Spy.

525
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:41,020
Where?

526
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:42,570
It's the Cold War. We were everywhere.

527
00:40:42,595 --> 00:40:45,976
Uh, Belfast, Bucharest, Belgrade, Budapest

528
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,904
I like the B's coz I can make it rhyme.

529
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:49,513
-Now?
<i>-Been ridin' the desk the past</i>

530
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:52,249
six years, tryin' to figure out where
our future enemies are comin' from.

531
00:40:52,274 --> 00:40:54,884
Never occured to me,
they would be comin' from above.

532
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,025
Name a detail so bizarre,
a Skrull can never fabricate it.

533
00:41:01,037 --> 00:41:02,497
If a toast is cut diagonally

534
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:03,747
I can't eat it.

535
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,017
You didn't need that, did you?

536
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:10,337
No. No, I didn't. But I enjoyed it.

537
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:11,694
Okay. Your turn.

538
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:13,938
Prove you're not a Skrull.

539
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:25,264
And how is that supposed to prove to me

540
00:41:25,288 --> 00:41:26,674
you're not a Skrull?

541
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:27,642
That's a Photon Blast.

542
00:41:28,178 --> 00:41:28,959
And?

543
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:30,445
A Skrull can't do that.

544
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,975
So, full bird Colonel turned
Spy turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent

545
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,778
must have pretty high security clearance.

546
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:37,894
Where's Pegasus?

547
00:41:41,357 --> 00:41:43,648
<i>♪ A lonely mother gazing
out of her window ♪</i>

548
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:44,627
Okay.

549
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:48,251
The Skrull's ?some? alien races
to infiltrate and take over planets

550
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:50,201
And you're Kree.

551
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:52,660
A race of noble warriors.

552
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:53,561
Heroes.

553
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:54,863
Noble warrior heroes.

554
00:41:55,274 --> 00:41:58,585
So uhm, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

555
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:04,135
They believe that she developed
a lightspeed engine at Pegasus

556
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,254
Lightspeed?

557
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:09,654
Gotta admit. That's not the
craziest thing I've heard today.

558
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,193
Well, still early.

559
00:42:11,218 --> 00:42:12,602
And you. What do you want?

560
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:16,386
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

561
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:17,411
And?

562
00:42:20,883 --> 00:42:21,883
Look.

563
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:23,897
War's a universal language.

564
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:27,037
I know a rogue soldier when I see one.

565
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,332
You got a personal stake in this.

566
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:41,065
Government property.

567
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,204
Turn your vehicle around.

568
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:45,268
Nicholas Joseph Fury.

569
00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:47,062
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

570
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:48,462
Place your thumb on the pad.

571
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,198
One moment.

572
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:53,805
Nicholas Joseph Fury.

573
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,094
You've three names?

574
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:57,578
Everybody calls me Fury.

575
00:42:57,724 --> 00:43:00,128
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph. Not Nick.

576
00:43:00,153 --> 00:43:01,392
Just Fury.

577
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:02,626
What did your mom call you?

578
00:43:02,651 --> 00:43:03,252
Fury.

579
00:43:03,277 --> 00:43:04,376
What did you call her?

580
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:04,882
Fury!

581
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:05,946
What about your kids?

582
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:08,261
If I have them, they'll call me Fury.

583
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:09,151
<i>You're cleared for access.</i>

584
00:43:09,176 --> 00:43:10,304
Thank you.

585
00:43:40,136 --> 00:43:41,345
Uh, hold up.

586
00:43:41,993 --> 00:43:44,835
You look like somebody's disaffected niece.

587
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:48,139
Put that on.

588
00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:50,172
What is it?

589
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:51,302
It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

590
00:43:51,304 --> 00:43:54,106
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

591
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,883
help with the covert part of your job?

592
00:43:55,908 --> 00:43:58,371
Said the space soldier who ?
on a rubber suit.

593
00:43:59,363 --> 00:44:00,471
Lose the flannel.

594
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:12,542
How can I help you?

595
00:44:13,304 --> 00:44:16,076
We're Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

596
00:44:17,646 --> 00:44:20,209
We're looking for a woman named Lawson.

597
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:21,837
A Doctor, Wendy Lawson.

598
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:24,947
Do you know her?

599
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:30,581
Follow me.

600
00:44:31,397 --> 00:44:31,788
Hm.

601
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:38,016
You familiar with the
phrase "welcome wagon"?

602
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:40,636
No.

603
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:43,260
Well, this ain't it.

604
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:52,805
Is that a communicator?

605
00:44:52,868 --> 00:44:53,773
Yeah.

606
00:44:53,798 --> 00:44:55,741
State of the art two-way pager.

607
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,236
Who're you paging?

608
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:57,982
My mom.

609
00:44:58,024 --> 00:44:59,066
Don't worry.

610
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:00,549
I didn't mention you.

611
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:29,221
Whoo Hoo Hoo!

612
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:40,629
After you!

613
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,640
Impressive.

614
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:44,881
Ohh, you should see what I
can do with a paper clip.

615
00:45:55,474 --> 00:45:59,137
Mmmm...how are you? Hm??

616
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,597
Just look at you!

617
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,969
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

618
00:46:05,994 --> 00:46:07,015
Aren't you cute?

619
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,246
And what's your name, huh?

620
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:09,238
What's your name?

621
00:46:09,264 --> 00:46:10,004
Goose.

622
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:12,300
Cool name for a cool cat.

623
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:13,147
Fury.

624
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:13,860
Hm?

625
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,846
<i>I'll be back.</i>

626
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:23,278
Oh! Get my fingerprint out.

627
00:46:23,303 --> 00:46:25,128
Just let me unravel the...

628
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,065
You sat there

629
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:31,494
and watched me play with tape

630
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:32,590
when all you had to do

631
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:35,147
I didn't wanna steal your thunder.

632
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:52,765
Ah! Lawson.

633
00:47:03,428 --> 00:47:06,593
Lawson's plan for the Lightspeed engine.

634
00:47:07,384 --> 00:47:09,497
I wonder why they terminated the project.

635
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:10,745
Uhm.

636
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:13,390
Maybe because she's...

637
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:14,838
cuckoo.

638
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:18,241
Kreeglyphs?

639
00:47:18,266 --> 00:47:19,052
<i>Huh?</i>

640
00:47:20,836 --> 00:47:23,083
Lawson is not cuckoo.

641
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:26,340
She's Kree.

642
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:27,737
Well...

643
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:29,296
She's dead.

644
00:47:29,616 --> 00:47:30,468
What?

645
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:34,670
Crashed an aces aircraft
during an unauthorized test flight.

646
00:47:34,842 --> 00:47:36,378
Took a pilot down with her.

647
00:47:36,774 --> 00:47:38,880
That's why security here's so unfriendly.

648
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:42,266
They're covering up a
billion-dollar mistake.

649
00:47:43,483 --> 00:47:45,531
Oh, and your Lightspeed engine?

650
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:46,457
It's toast.

651
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:51,897
When did this crash happen?

652
00:47:52,382 --> 00:47:54,588
Six years ago. 1989.

653
00:47:56,454 --> 00:47:58,113
Who was the pilot?

654
00:47:58,392 --> 00:47:59,396
Uhm.

655
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:02,363
Most of this thing's redacted, but

656
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:04,805
but there is a testimony here from a

657
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:06,542
Maria Rambeau?

658
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:08,772
Last person to see them alive.

659
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:12,124
<i>Received text:Keller</i>

660
00:48:13,928 --> 00:48:15,197
You okay?

661
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:17,572
Mm-hm

662
00:48:19,565 --> 00:48:20,600
?Back in 10?

663
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:53,201
This isn't about fighting wars.

664
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:55,607
It's about ending them.

665
00:49:00,676 --> 00:49:02,569
I know Lawson was Kree.

666
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:05,275
She was here on C-53 and
died on a plane crash.

667
00:49:05,578 --> 00:49:07,694
<i>Do you know anything about this?</i>

668
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:11,558
I just discovered a mission
report sent from C-53

669
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,650
There's only so much I'm
cleared to tell you, Vers.

670
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:15,675
But

671
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:22,398
<i>Lawson was an undercover Kree operative</i>

672
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:23,704
named Mar-Vell

673
00:49:23,777 --> 00:49:26,987
She was working on a unique energy core.

674
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:30,072
Experimenting with tech that apparently

675
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:32,223
could help us win the war.

676
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:39,898
Is she still here?

677
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:42,325
She's cooperating with
the investigation, Sir.

678
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:44,560
- You men, stay here.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

679
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,806
I wanna question her alone.

680
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:50,876
Excellent work, Nicholas.

681
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:55,848
Does it say anything about me?

682
00:49:56,048 --> 00:49:58,909
- Anything about you?
No, of course not? Why would it be?

683
00:49:59,114 --> 00:50:02,183
I found evidence that I had a life here.

684
00:50:02,455 --> 00:50:04,122
<i>On C-53?</i>

685
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:09,489
Mar-Vell is who I see when I
visit the Supreme Intelligence.

686
00:50:09,513 --> 00:50:11,030
I knew her.

687
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:12,632
And I knew her as Lawson.

688
00:50:12,832 --> 00:50:16,237
- This looks like Skrull simulation, Vers.
- No, it's not.

689
00:50:16,437 --> 00:50:19,171
- Because I remember. I was here.
- Stop. Remember your training.

690
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:21,238
Know your enemy. It could be you.

691
00:50:21,304 --> 00:50:25,277
Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.

692
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:27,760
She's on sublevel 6.

693
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:31,607
I'll get off on 5. Take the stairs
in case she makes a run for it.

694
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,708
Do a pincer move. Like we did in Havana.

695
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:39,763
Right! Like we did in Havana.

696
00:50:49,803 --> 00:50:52,971
We're nearing the jump point.
Leave your beacon on so I could find you.

697
00:50:53,171 --> 00:50:55,874
We'll get to the bottom of this, Vers.

698
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:57,074
Together.

699
00:50:59,746 --> 00:51:00,980
Okay.

700
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:20,366
Vers!

701
00:51:22,568 --> 00:51:23,268
Vers!

702
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:43,390
- Fury's colluding with the target.
- Then why did he call us in?

703
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,910
All I know is we take him in too.
Dead or alive.

704
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:47,252
Dead or alive?

705
00:52:02,475 --> 00:52:03,443
Go! Go, go!

706
00:52:15,823 --> 00:52:18,659
Was it something I said?

707
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,337
Umm-mmm.

708
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,989
Ohhh!

709
00:52:56,629 --> 00:53:00,967
Now, you know.
I don't really need these to see.

710
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:05,639
But! They do, kind of, complete the look.

711
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:07,439
Don't you think?

712
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:27,225
- You called them in?
- I had to, (?).

713
00:53:41,741 --> 00:53:44,593
- Coulson! You have eyes on 'em?
- They're not down here.

714
00:53:46,716 --> 00:53:48,353
Let's try the den(?).

715
00:53:56,823 --> 00:53:57,409
What?

716
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,186
Your communicator.
You obviously can't be trusted with it.

717
00:54:30,923 --> 00:54:33,993
- Do you know how to fly this thing?
- Uh, we'll see.

718
00:54:34,193 --> 00:54:35,962
That's a yes or no question.

719
00:54:39,766 --> 00:54:40,999
Yes.

720
00:54:44,236 --> 00:54:46,272
That's what I'm talkin' about.

721
00:55:12,795 --> 00:55:14,699
We got a stowaway.

722
00:55:14,793 --> 00:55:17,039
<i>Meow!</i>

723
00:55:17,155 --> 00:55:18,288
<i>Meow!!</i>

724
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:19,362
Hang on, Goose.

725
00:55:24,944 --> 00:55:25,878
Goose.

726
00:55:25,915 --> 00:55:30,750
Oh. Oh, Goose.

727
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:34,286
Who's the good kitty, huh? Huh, Goose?

728
00:55:34,754 --> 00:55:40,126
Yes. That's right. Who's a good kitten,
Goose? You the good kitten, that's right.

729
00:55:40,151 --> 00:55:41,394
See anyone you know?

730
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,315
Funny story.

731
00:55:44,325 --> 00:55:48,466
I worked on (?).
No memory.

732
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:50,599
That was six years ago.

733
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:54,856
So you think you're the pilot
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

734
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:57,242
I'm saying the last person to see
them alive could probably tell us.

735
00:55:57,442 --> 00:55:59,611
- Maria Rambeau.
- Mmm-hmm.

736
00:55:59,811 --> 00:56:01,147
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

737
00:56:02,014 --> 00:56:04,784
Due east. Hang a right at Memphis.

738
00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:10,248
That agent that stopped the
Skrulls from finding us.

739
00:56:10,272 --> 00:56:12,272
Coulson. Good new guy.

740
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:15,928
- Guess he don't hate me yet.
- Yeah, well. Give 'em time.

741
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:21,388
I guess he had a feelin', you know.
Went with his gut against orders.

742
00:56:21,413 --> 00:56:25,370
It's a really hard thing to do.
But, it's what keeps us human.

743
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:29,708
- I get in trouble for that. A lot.
- Oh, I see that about you.

744
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,980
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls.

745
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,351
I'm guessing that's not standard
Kree operating procedure.

746
00:56:37,551 --> 00:56:39,793
Well, I won't tell your
boss if you don't tell mine.

747
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:50,830
- Ronan.
- The accusers completed their operation

748
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,896
But the greater mission was a
failure, thanks to your team.

749
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:57,702
It was a trap.
To lure our operative Vers to Torfa

750
00:56:57,902 --> 00:56:59,747
- and kidnap her.
- Give us the location.

751
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:03,476
- We'll take care of the terrorists threat.
- By bombing them out of the galaxy.

752
00:57:03,676 --> 00:57:06,512
No. We'll handle this.

753
00:57:06,537 --> 00:57:11,651
A sum of Skrulls anywhere is a threat to Kree everywhere.
Where are they?

754
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:14,252
Lost.

755
00:57:14,452 --> 00:57:17,056
They are lost, for now.

756
00:57:17,256 --> 00:57:19,992
- But we will find them.
- Do so.

757
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:23,395
Or we will.

758
00:57:26,304 --> 00:57:28,734
Maintain the course to C-53.

759
00:57:33,372 --> 00:57:47,529
<i>♪You Gotta Be by Des'ree♪</i>

760
00:57:47,554 --> 00:57:50,856
Excuse me. I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

761
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,429
Auntie Carol? Mom! It's Auntie Carol!

762
00:57:57,464 --> 00:57:59,765
I knew it. Everyone said you were dead.

763
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:01,467
But we knew they were lying.

764
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:06,304
I'm not really who you think I am.

765
00:58:15,046 --> 00:58:17,749
That is the craziest shit I've ever heard.

766
00:58:17,782 --> 00:58:19,284
Green transforming aliens?

767
00:58:19,651 --> 00:58:22,121
- There's no such thing.
- You're absolutely right, young lady.

768
00:58:22,146 --> 00:58:23,598
There's no such thing.

769
00:58:23,623 --> 00:58:28,168
'Coz if there were,
we would wanna keep that to ourselves.

770
00:58:28,193 --> 00:58:29,729
You don't believe me?

771
00:58:37,335 --> 00:58:40,338
No way! That's so cool!

772
00:58:40,538 --> 00:58:43,543
Whoa ho! She could do a lot more
than just make tea with those hands.

773
00:58:43,743 --> 00:58:46,412
- Like what? Show us!
- Maybe later.

774
00:58:46,612 --> 00:58:49,882
I have some of your stuff. I will get it.

775
00:58:50,783 --> 00:58:52,451
You wanna give her a hand with that?

776
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:54,291
Hm?

777
00:59:08,691 --> 00:59:11,464
You don't remember anything?

778
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:15,914
I see...flashes.

779
00:59:16,441 --> 00:59:17,890
Little moments.

780
00:59:18,929 --> 00:59:20,910
But I can't tell what's real.

781
00:59:22,763 --> 00:59:26,117
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning.

782
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:29,056
Maybe it will all make sense.

783
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:37,029
You woke me up.
Banging on my door at dawn. The usual.

784
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:40,199
Back then, we had to get up so early.

785
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:44,013
The Air Force there wasn't a
lot of women who fly combat, so

786
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:47,359
testing Lawson's plane was our only
shot at doing something that matter.

787
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,237
You wanted to race to base in your old Mustang.

788
00:59:50,261 --> 00:59:53,538
And I didn't wasn't about to argue coz I knew my Camaro would dominate.

789
00:59:53,563 --> 00:59:55,448
But you cheated. Took a shortcut.

790
00:59:55,648 --> 00:59:59,394
- Since when is a shortcut cheating?
- Since it violates predetermined rules of engagement.

791
00:59:59,419 --> 01:00:03,189
- I definitely don't remember those.
- Hmm, course you don't.

792
01:00:07,626 --> 01:00:12,573
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was...agitated.

793
01:00:12,773 --> 01:00:16,669
She said, she had lives to save.

794
01:00:16,669 --> 01:00:19,846
She was trying to take the ACs
up herself but you said that...

795
01:00:19,871 --> 01:00:21,066
There are lives at stake

796
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,118
I would fly the plane.

797
01:00:24,143 --> 01:00:24,815
Yeah.

798
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,460
Yup. Big hero moment.

799
01:00:28,134 --> 01:00:30,747
The kinda moment we've
both been waiting for.

800
01:00:31,249 --> 01:00:33,920
The doc was always unique.

801
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:41,092
That's why we liked her. But now you're
saying she's from another planet?

802
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:43,663
I know this must be hard for you.

803
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,234
Oh, this part right here?

804
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,235
No.

805
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,259
Nah. Umm-umm.

806
01:00:51,633 --> 01:00:55,975
What's hard. Is losing my best friend.

807
01:00:56,175 --> 01:01:00,345
In a mission so secret,
they act like it never even happened.

808
01:01:01,443 --> 01:01:07,987
Hard. Is knowing you were out there
somewhere too damn stubborn to die.

809
01:01:08,187 --> 01:01:14,026
And now you come up in here after six
years. With your supercharged fire hands.

810
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:17,562
And you expect me to call you...I
don't even know what...Vers?

811
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:21,252
Is that really who you are now?

812
01:01:23,385 --> 01:01:24,514
I don't know.

813
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:31,365
<i>Come look!</i>

814
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:34,695
<i>(sound of stomach gurgling)</i>

815
01:01:37,955 --> 01:01:40,085
This is me and you on Halloween.

816
01:01:40,285 --> 01:01:43,521
I'm Amelia Earhard.
And, you're Janis Joplin.

817
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:47,060
Oh, this is you when you were little.
You didn't know (?) your parents, so

818
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,928
So Mom said, we became your real family.

819
01:01:49,128 --> 01:01:52,598
This is us on Christmas.
I got my peanut butter slippers.

820
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:54,122
This is another picture of
you when you were little.

821
01:01:54,147 --> 01:01:58,627
...you've always...Oh,
and this is right after you graduated...

822
01:01:58,803 --> 01:02:05,030
This is you... Air Force... good day...
This right here is our favorite guy...

823
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,017
Oh, wait. I forgot.

824
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:08,294
Your jacket.

825
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:11,703
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore
after I spilled ketchup on it.

826
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:27,259
That was all that survived the crash.

827
01:02:28,298 --> 01:02:30,403
Or so we thought.

828
01:02:35,306 --> 01:02:38,644
- Don't answer that.
- It's just my neighbor.

829
01:02:38,844 --> 01:02:41,513
They can change into anyone.

830
01:02:45,306 --> 01:02:48,720
- Hi there.
- What do you want?

831
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:53,260
- Uhm...
- Hey, Tom. This is my friend, Carol.

832
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,438
Oh, pleased to meet you!

833
01:02:56,291 --> 01:03:00,613
Yowza! Heh heh.
Static electricity out here's no joke.

834
01:03:00,966 --> 01:03:03,724
Oh, I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road. And I...

835
01:03:03,749 --> 01:03:07,507
I was just wondering if you mind if I
bring the boys over for a closer look-see?

836
01:03:07,707 --> 01:03:11,176
- A closer look-see.
- Yeah. - To see the bird

837
01:03:11,376 --> 01:03:14,246
Parked out by the road? Hmm.

838
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:17,088
You are really working overtime
to sell this one, aren't you...

839
01:03:17,112 --> 01:03:18,864
Talos?!

840
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:22,053
I'm sorry. Tom. This really isn't
a good time.

841
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:23,893
I'll come by tomorrow. Okay?

842
01:03:23,918 --> 01:03:25,725
- Uhh...
- O-kay.

843
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:30,996
You know you really should
be kinder to your neighbors?

844
01:03:31,196 --> 01:03:34,667
You never know when you're
gonna need to borrow some sugar.

845
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:43,709
Hang on a second! Before you just
swinging(?) those jazz hands around.

846
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:46,264
Making a mess of your friend's house.

847
01:03:46,811 --> 01:03:49,865
- It's a lovely home.
- Oh my god.

848
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,677
What the hell?

849
01:03:55,754 --> 01:03:57,589
No one's gonna hurt your girl.

850
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,992
Just, don't kill me.

851
01:04:00,017 --> 01:04:01,859
We got a really complicated situation.

852
01:04:01,884 --> 01:04:06,507
I'm about five seconds from complicating
that wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brain.

853
01:04:06,532 --> 01:04:11,478
I'm sorry I simmed your boss. But now
I stand before you as my true self.

854
01:04:11,503 --> 01:04:14,686
- Without deception.
- And who is that out there?

855
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:17,311
Okay! That's a fair point.

856
01:04:17,335 --> 01:04:21,210
But I'm sure that you understand,
I have to take some precautions.

857
01:04:21,235 --> 01:04:26,079
I saw you, "crush" twenty of my
best men with your hands bound.

858
01:04:26,104 --> 01:04:27,261
I just wanna talk.

859
01:04:27,285 --> 01:04:29,895
Last time we talked I ended
up hanging from my ankles.

860
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,758
That was before I knew who you were.

861
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:36,027
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

862
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:41,629
I have an audio recording from Pegasus.
With your voice. From a plane crash.

863
01:04:41,654 --> 01:04:47,707
Six years ago. On a device,
I believe you call, a blackbox.

864
01:04:48,007 --> 01:04:52,183
They told me it was destroyed in the crash.
How'd you get it?

865
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:56,881
She don't understand. Young lady, I have
this precious girl that kinda loves me to

866
01:04:56,906 --> 01:04:58,601
get into places I'm not supposed to be.

867
01:04:58,626 --> 01:05:02,613
Call me young lady again and I'm gonna put my
foot in the place it's not supposed to be.

868
01:05:05,157 --> 01:05:07,660
Am I supposed to guess...where that is?

869
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:08,618
Your ass.

870
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:13,077
Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge
here. But look, I just need your help.

871
01:05:13,102 --> 01:05:17,301
To decode some coordinates.
If you sit down and listen to this.

872
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:20,472
I assure you, it'll be worth your while.

873
01:05:22,584 --> 01:05:25,001
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

874
01:05:25,598 --> 01:05:27,022
Deal.

875
01:05:27,313 --> 01:05:31,413
Oh my god. Get that thing away!
How'd it get in here?

876
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:36,396
The cat? This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

877
01:05:36,421 --> 01:05:40,325
That's not a cat. That's a Flerken.

878
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:41,976
A Flerken! Ha ha ha ha ha!

879
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,250
Mom?

880
01:05:50,169 --> 01:05:53,639
- Monica.
- Why can't I listen too? - Sshh!

881
01:06:20,264 --> 01:06:23,735
- What's happening?
- It's loading.

882
01:06:27,473 --> 01:06:30,542
<i>Punch in the coordinates
5229 negative 4-7.</i>

883
01:06:30,742 --> 01:06:33,945
<i>- 84768, 0 point 2.
- Copy that.</i>

884
01:06:34,145 --> 01:06:37,015

- My laboratory.</i>

885
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,537
<i>- Your laboratory? What do you mean?
- Oh no. Is that...</i>

886
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:44,455
<i>Wait. What is that? It's not showing up on my radar.</i>

887
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,425
<i>Go Carol. Slide!</i>

888
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:51,053
- (?) Who the hell are they?
- Those are the bad guys. Fly faster now.

889
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:51,986
Yes, ma'am.

890
01:06:57,866 --> 01:07:00,673
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

891
01:07:00,873 --> 01:07:02,274
I never should've
brought you along.

892
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:08,270
Here comes some Gs.

893
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:29,937
They're firing backwards. Hold on.

894
01:07:40,344 --> 01:07:41,828
Pull up! Pull up! Pull up!

895
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:47,452
Stay with me, Lawson.

896
01:08:05,478 --> 01:08:08,439
<i>- Carol! Maria! Do you copy?</i>
- Yeah. I copy.

897
01:08:08,464 --> 01:08:10,741
- We hit ground.
<i>- Carol, are you okay?!</i>

898
01:08:10,941 --> 01:08:13,044
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- Yeah, I copy!

899
01:08:15,152 --> 01:08:16,611

900
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,376
Your blood...it's...

01:08:20,401 --> 01:08:21,802
it's blue.

902
01:08:21,827 --> 01:08:23,339
Yeah, well, yeah.

903
01:08:24,122 --> 01:08:25,547
How's my hair?

904
01:08:26,284 --> 01:08:29,428
Help me out, will ya?

905
01:08:31,753 --> 01:08:35,324
I gotta destroy it before they get here.

906
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:36,583
Lawson.

907
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:39,009
Do you remember what I said about our work here?

908
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:41,573
What it's for?

909
01:08:41,597 --> 01:08:43,141
To end wars?

910
01:08:43,142 --> 01:08:44,142
Yeah.

911
01:08:44,342 --> 01:08:46,844
But the wars are bigger than you know.

912
01:08:47,946 --> 01:08:48,811
Damn it.

913
01:08:49,634 --> 01:08:52,066
My name is not Lawson

914
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,320
My real name...is Mar-Vell.

915
01:08:55,345 --> 01:08:58,134
And I come from a planet called Hala

916
01:08:59,834 --> 01:09:03,202
I would say that you're deluded but...
we just got shot down by a spaceship

917
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:04,640
and your blood is blue.

918
01:09:05,596 --> 01:09:09,601
Listen. I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

919
01:09:09,801 --> 01:09:12,638
Now skedaddle before you
give my any more regrets.

920
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:15,606
Just remember the coordinates, okay?

921
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:18,906
- You gotta save them without me!
- Save who? How?

922
01:09:18,931 --> 01:09:22,502
- Now, I gotta...blow this engine before
they find it. - What are you doing?

923
01:09:42,335 --> 01:09:45,436
We have no interest in hurting you.

924
01:09:45,636 --> 01:09:50,141
No? Coz all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

925
01:09:51,343 --> 01:09:54,512
The energy core? Where is it?

926
01:09:54,712 --> 01:09:57,166
Air rescue's on the way.

927
01:09:57,366 --> 01:09:59,501
We have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

928
01:09:59,526 --> 01:10:02,653
Then I see no reason to
prolong this conversation.

929
01:10:02,678 --> 01:10:03,678
No, wait!

930
01:10:09,723 --> 01:10:11,744
You mean that energy core?

931
01:10:15,964 --> 01:10:16,758
Nooo!

932
01:11:00,713 --> 01:11:02,948
Commander. She's still moving.

933
01:11:03,148 --> 01:11:05,784
- Permission to fire.
- Hold your fire.

934
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:18,551
There's nothing left.
The core's been destroyed.

935
01:11:28,205 --> 01:11:29,983
She absorbed its power.

936
01:11:32,678 --> 01:11:34,813
She's coming with us.

937
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,926
He lied to me.

938
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:01,540
Everything that I knew was a lie.

939
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:06,732
- Now, you understand.
- What? What do I understand now?

940
01:12:06,757 --> 01:12:09,362
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell. He killed her.

941
01:12:10,482 --> 01:12:16,123
'Cause she found out that she was on
the wrong side of an unjust war.

942
01:12:16,148 --> 01:12:17,148
No.

943
01:12:17,358 --> 01:12:19,358
Your people are terrorists.

944
01:12:19,637 --> 01:12:23,209
They kill innocents.
I saw the ruins on Torfan.

945
01:12:23,234 --> 01:12:26,697
Ruins that the accusers
are responsible for.

946
01:12:26,897 --> 01:12:30,868
My people lived as refugees on Torfan.

947
01:12:30,892 --> 01:12:35,866
Homeless. Ever since we resisted Kree
rule and they destroyed our planet.

948
01:12:36,516 --> 01:12:38,792
And the handful of us that are left

949
01:12:39,698 --> 01:12:43,143
will be slaughtered next, unless..

950
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:45,993
you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

951
01:12:47,569 --> 01:12:51,329
The core that she found would've
powered a Lightspeed ship capable of

952
01:12:51,354 --> 01:12:53,865
carrying us to safety, a new home...

953
01:12:54,232 --> 01:12:56,902
where the Kree can't reach us.

954
01:12:57,963 --> 01:13:01,818
Lawson always told us that our work at
Pegasus wasn't to fight wars.

955
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:03,111
But to end them.

956
01:13:03,268 --> 01:13:08,506
She wanted you to help us.
Find, the core.

957
01:13:09,988 --> 01:13:13,069
- Well I already destroyed it.
- No! You destroyed the engine.

958
01:13:13,104 --> 01:13:16,010
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

959
01:13:16,034 --> 01:13:19,382
If you help us decode those coordinates

960
01:13:20,193 --> 01:13:21,603
we could find it

961
01:13:24,289 --> 01:13:26,342
- You'll use it to destroy us.

962
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:31,176
We just want a home.

963
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:42,541
You and I...lost everything, at the
hands of the Kree. Can't you see it now?

964
01:13:42,566 --> 01:13:44,836
You're not one of them.

965
01:13:46,745 --> 01:13:52,083
You don't know me.
You have no idea who I am.

966
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:56,388
I don't even know who I am.

967
01:13:57,889 --> 01:14:00,125
You're Carol Danvers.

968
01:14:01,436 --> 01:14:06,640
You are the woman on that blackbox
risking her life, to do the right thing.

969
01:14:07,764 --> 01:14:11,768
My best friend.
Who supported me as a mother...

970
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:14,060
and a pilot when no one else did.

971
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:19,333
You're smart. And funny.
And a huge pain in the ass.

972
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:23,090
And you were the most
powerful person I knew.

973
01:14:23,515 --> 01:14:26,751
Way before you could shoot fire from this.

974
01:14:26,775 --> 01:14:28,775
Hear me?

975
01:14:30,135 --> 01:14:31,923
Do you hear me?

976
01:14:39,114 --> 01:14:41,633
Come here. Give me a hug.

977
01:14:46,851 --> 01:14:53,067
I know I don't deserve your trust.
But you were our only lead.

978
01:14:53,092 --> 01:14:58,130
We discovered that your energy
signature matched Mar-Vell's core.

979
01:14:58,955 --> 01:15:01,425
Now we know why.

980
01:15:02,545 --> 01:15:06,649
If only you knew the
importance of it to me.

981
01:15:07,446 --> 01:15:13,317
I just need your help decoding
the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.

982
01:15:13,838 --> 01:15:17,056
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

983
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:19,036
Orbital positioning and velocity.

984
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:22,249
You didn't find her lab on
Earth coz it's not on Earth.

985
01:15:22,274 --> 01:15:24,909
That was the location on the
day of the crash six years ago.

986
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:28,701
If we track its course,
we'll find it in orbit right now.

987
01:15:28,726 --> 01:15:30,612
It's just basic physics.

988
01:15:32,917 --> 01:15:34,550
In orbit.

989
01:15:36,354 --> 01:15:39,857
Was that so difficult to figure out?
I mean, you're my science guy, right?

990
01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:42,896
Yon-Rogg will catch up to me soon.

991
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,581
We've got to get to the
core before he does.

992
01:15:45,606 --> 01:15:47,551
Hm. We're going to space?

993
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,743
In what?

994
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:52,764
A few tweaks to your vessel should do it.
I can handle the modification.

995
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:55,073
Hm! Your science guy.

996
01:16:01,264 --> 01:16:04,057
Well, I could use a co-pilot.

997
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:07,261
No! No, I can't.

998
01:16:07,852 --> 01:16:09,054
I can't leave Monica.

999
01:16:09,254 --> 01:16:12,390
Mommy, it's okay.
I could stay with grandma and pawpaw.

1000
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:14,879
There's no way I'm going baby.
It's too dangerous.

1001
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:18,292
Testing brand new aerospace tech is
dangerous. Didn't you use to do that?

1002
01:16:19,484 --> 01:16:23,676
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere
in a craft not designed for the journey.

1003
01:16:23,701 --> 01:16:27,331
You anticipate hostile encounters with a
technologically superior foreign enemy.

1004
01:16:27,441 --> 01:16:28,522
Correct?

1005
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:31,217
That's what I'm saying. You have to go!

1006
01:16:31,242 --> 01:16:31,698
Monica.

1007
01:16:31,723 --> 01:16:34,319
You have the chance to fly the coolest
mission in the history of missions.

1008
01:16:34,379 --> 01:16:37,499
And you're gonna give it up to stay on the
couch and watch "Fresh Prince" with me?

1009
01:16:37,524 --> 01:16:38,608
- What?

1010
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:43,121
I just think you should consider what kinda
example you're setting for your daughter.

1011
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:54,258
- What's goin on around here?
- I know. I know. I'll explain inside.

1012
01:16:54,283 --> 01:16:55,612
Thanks for being here.

1013
01:17:00,305 --> 01:17:01,980
Your mom's lucky.

1014
01:17:02,638 --> 01:17:05,460
When there were handing out kids,
they gave her the toughest one.

1015
01:17:06,244 --> 01:17:10,115
- Lieutenant Trouble.
- You remember.

1016
01:17:10,505 --> 01:17:13,034
Is that mine?

1017
01:17:13,058 --> 01:17:17,838
No! No. You hang on to
it until I come back.

1018
01:17:18,374 --> 01:17:21,089
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1019
01:17:21,114 --> 01:17:23,166
I can't wear these Kree colors anymore.

1020
01:17:23,762 --> 01:17:28,767
And since you're obviously the only person
around here with any sense of style...

1021
01:17:29,935 --> 01:17:33,235
Hmm?

1022
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:36,009
Whoa!

1023
01:17:36,765 --> 01:17:37,809
No.

1024
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:41,959
Uh-uh.

1025
01:17:42,433 --> 01:17:44,699
Definitely not!

1026
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:49,585
Well since we're on the same team.

1027
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:08,266
How do I look?

1028
01:18:08,291 --> 01:18:10,317
Flash.

1029
01:18:29,776 --> 01:18:31,104
What took you so long?

1030
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:34,206
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1031
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:36,987
-PRY46B...
- No. No codes.

1032
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:39,662
That system is fallible as we learnt.

1033
01:18:39,978 --> 01:18:41,747
Okay. Then let's do this.

1034
01:18:42,404 --> 01:18:45,752
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1035
01:18:45,777 --> 01:18:48,765
The person you most admire and
respect, I guess.

1036
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,456
But you would never tell me who.

1037
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:54,561
And what is your earliest memory of Hala?

1038
01:18:54,586 --> 01:18:57,822
The transfusion.
Blue blood running through my veins.

1039
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:00,025
Whose blood?

1040
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:12,438
It's my blood

1041
01:19:12,638 --> 01:19:14,371
that's coursing through her veins.

1042
01:19:19,565 --> 01:19:22,819
- What've you done with her?
- You're too late.

1043
01:19:39,324 --> 01:19:40,779
Cheer up, (?).

1044
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:59,510
Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53.
Come at once.

1045
01:19:59,535 --> 01:20:02,126
For the good of all Kree, Commander.

1046
01:20:02,151 --> 01:20:04,353
The infestation will be eradicated.

1047
01:20:07,165 --> 01:20:08,864
Rising 5-0-0 and climbing.

1048
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:15,426
You know you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1049
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:19,343
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1050
01:20:19,469 --> 01:20:23,141
As long as he continues to freak you out.
Like that. Well...

1051
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:28,620
I'm gonna keep givin' him all the
love and hugs that he needs, right?

1052
01:20:28,645 --> 01:20:32,059
Can I ask you something?
You just turn into anything you want?

1053
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:34,083
Oh, well, I have to see it first.

1054
01:20:34,107 --> 01:20:35,951
Can you all do it?

1055
01:20:35,952 --> 01:20:42,092
Physiologically, yeah. But, uh,
it takes practice and uhm, dare I say...

1056
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:43,852
Talent, to...do wa...

1057
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:45,102
Can you turn into a cat?

1058
01:20:45,127 --> 01:20:46,394
What's a cat?

1059
01:20:46,419 --> 01:20:47,718
What about a filing cabinet?

1060
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:51,978
Why would I...turn into a filing cabinet?

1061
01:20:52,003 --> 01:20:55,337
Venus Fly Trap? I'll give you fifty bucks
right now if you turn into a Venus Fly Trap.

1062
01:20:55,361 --> 01:20:56,106
<i>*audibly annoyed sigh*</i>

1063
01:20:56,107 --> 01:20:59,978
Switching engines from scram
jet to fusion. Buckle up, folks.

1064
01:21:08,482 --> 01:21:12,371
Hey. Is this normal?
Like, space turbulence?

1065
01:21:12,396 --> 01:21:13,267
Pretty much.

1066
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:48,793
Locking in our coordinate grid.

1067
01:21:49,394 --> 01:21:50,695
Where is it?

1068
01:21:53,804 --> 01:21:56,472
It's here. It's gotta be here.

1069
01:21:56,896 --> 01:22:01,801
(?) ...nothing but behind.

1070
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:09,234
Decloaking activated.

1071
01:23:12,937 --> 01:23:14,627
Is that it? The core?

1072
01:23:14,652 --> 01:23:16,941
In her notes, she called it,
the "Tesseract".

1073
01:23:23,688 --> 01:23:24,282
Whoa.

1074
01:23:25,471 --> 01:23:27,806
What was Lawson doing
with all these kid stuff?

1075
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:36,585
Ehem.

1076
01:23:41,673 --> 01:23:42,873
We're not alone.

1077
01:24:06,163 --> 01:24:07,531
Talos.

1078
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:19,598
He didn't come here for the Tessaract.

1079
01:24:42,866 --> 01:24:44,201
It's okay.

1080
01:24:49,064 --> 01:24:53,711
We didn't know what to do. Mar-Vell warned
us not to send a signal for any reason.

1081
01:24:53,911 --> 01:24:56,018
Or the Kree would find us.

1082
01:24:56,042 --> 01:24:58,042
You did the right thing.

1083
01:25:07,197 --> 01:25:11,234
It's okay. It's okay. She's alright. She's a friend.

1084
01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:15,012
I am not gonna hurt you.

1085
01:25:15,134 --> 01:25:16,702
She led me to you.

1086
01:25:17,702 --> 01:25:19,225
I'm so sorry.

1087
01:25:21,105 --> 01:25:25,744
- I didn't know.
- Carol, this is war.

1088
01:25:27,187 --> 01:25:30,324
My hands are filthy from it too.

1089
01:25:31,164 --> 01:25:33,133
But we're here now.

1090
01:25:33,742 --> 01:25:35,742
You found my family.

1091
01:25:39,493 --> 01:25:44,564
This is just the beginning. There are
thousands of us separated from each other.

1092
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:48,313
Scattered...throughout the universe.

1093
01:26:06,315 --> 01:26:11,081
If I played the same pinball machine for
six years, I'd have some high scores too.

1094
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:15,344
Fraternizing with the enemy.

1095
01:26:16,384 --> 01:26:17,368
Uh-uh

1096
01:26:29,147 --> 01:26:32,592
- What did you to your uniform?
- He got in her head.

1097
01:26:32,617 --> 01:26:35,219
- Just like we thought.
- The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.

1098
01:26:35,244 --> 01:26:39,239
You can see they're not soldiers.
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1099
01:26:39,264 --> 01:26:40,606
And the core?

1100
01:26:41,007 --> 01:26:46,591
- You lied to me.
- I made you the best version of yourself.

1101
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,838
What's given...can be taken away.

1102
01:27:34,697 --> 01:27:52,717
<i>♪ Nirvana - Come As You Are ♪</i>

1103
01:27:52,742 --> 01:27:58,313
There she is. Seems like your time
on C-53 jogged the old memory.

1104
01:27:58,895 --> 01:28:03,199
This jacket is killer, by the way.

1105
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:07,836
Oh, the music. It's a nice touch.

1106
01:28:07,861 --> 01:28:11,498
- Let. me. out.
- No can do.

1107
01:28:11,523 --> 01:28:15,393
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1108
01:28:15,418 --> 01:28:18,788
With what exactly?
Your power comes from us.

1109
01:28:18,813 --> 01:28:21,484
You didn't give me these powers.
The blast did.

1110
01:28:21,509 --> 01:28:24,825
And yet you've never had the
strength to control them on your own.

1111
01:28:35,765 --> 01:28:38,660
Species. Flerken.
Threat. High.

1112
01:28:44,524 --> 01:28:47,276
It's a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter.

1113
01:28:49,817 --> 01:28:54,167
Species. Human Male.
Threat. Low to None.

1114
01:28:55,326 --> 01:28:56,522
That thing's clearly busted.

1115
01:28:56,547 --> 01:28:59,440
Load the Flerken onto the helio.

1116
01:28:59,689 --> 01:29:01,926
Jet the others into space.

1117
01:29:04,444 --> 01:29:06,059
You did good, ace.

1118
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:13,010
Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters
will threaten our borders no more.

1119
01:29:13,035 --> 01:29:17,941
I used to believe your lies. But the
Skrulls are just fighting for a home.

1120
01:29:18,141 --> 01:29:21,684
You're talking about destroying them
because they won't submit to your rule.

1121
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:24,215
- And neither will I.
- We found you.

1122
01:29:24,415 --> 01:29:27,617
- We embraced you as our own.
- You stole me.

1123
01:29:27,642 --> 01:29:30,980
From my home. My family. My friends.

1124
01:29:38,246 --> 01:29:40,949
It's cute how hard you try.

1125
01:29:42,725 --> 01:29:44,392
Remember

1126
01:29:45,636 --> 01:29:47,153
Without us...

1127
01:29:47,182 --> 01:29:48,876
<i>Give it up kiddo! </i>

1128
01:29:49,956 --> 01:29:50,914
<i>Stay down!</i>

1129
01:29:50,939 --> 01:29:51,842
You're weak.

1130
01:29:51,867 --> 01:29:53,110
<i>You're going too fast.</i>

1131
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,304
Helpless.

1132
01:30:02,854 --> 01:30:04,446
We saved you.

1133
01:30:13,498 --> 01:30:16,304
Without us, you're only human.

1134
01:30:18,469 --> 01:30:22,172
You're right. I'm only human.

1135
01:30:56,834 --> 01:31:01,339
On Hala, you are reborn. Vers.

1136
01:31:06,382 --> 01:31:09,620
My name is Carol.

1137
01:31:24,175 --> 01:31:25,792
She's trying to break out.

1138
01:32:10,062 --> 01:32:13,160
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1139
01:32:14,367 --> 01:32:16,396
But what happens when...

1140
01:32:18,993 --> 01:32:20,974
I'm finally set free.

1141
01:33:01,965 --> 01:33:04,426
You know you're glowing, right?

1142
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:05,714
I'll explain later.

1143
01:33:08,296 --> 01:33:10,574
Take the Tessaract.
Leave the lunchbox.

1144
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,419
- Me?
- Yes.

1145
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:13,887
I'm not touchin' that thing!

1146
01:33:13,912 --> 01:33:15,671
You want me to get you an oven mitt?

1147
01:33:20,529 --> 01:33:21,828
Oof!

1148
01:33:28,459 --> 01:33:30,461
Take the Skrulls in the Quad Jet and go.

1149
01:33:31,432 --> 01:33:33,619
Take the...Flerken with you.

1150
01:33:33,932 --> 01:33:36,833
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time!

1151
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:40,103
I'm...picking you up now.

1152
01:33:42,838 --> 01:33:45,174
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

1153
01:33:50,586 --> 01:33:52,049
O hey guys!

1154
01:33:55,428 --> 01:33:56,965
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1155
01:34:00,004 --> 01:34:02,212
I used to find you amusing.

1156
01:34:02,633 --> 01:34:04,967
Let's put an end to this!

1157
01:34:36,235 --> 01:34:38,110
<i>Mew...</i>

1158
01:34:38,765 --> 01:34:42,199

1169
01:35:32,401 --> 01:35:34,017
No, I just never liked you.

1170
01:35:39,973 --> 01:35:43,484
Incoming!

1171
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:51,586
Hey! In a hurry?

1172
01:35:53,334 --> 01:35:55,639
Don't make me do this.

1173
01:35:55,663 --> 01:35:56,342
Okay.

1174
01:36:10,455 --> 01:36:13,657
Unh! Come on! Do your thing!

1175
01:36:14,659 --> 01:36:15,642
Come on.

1176
01:36:18,042 --> 01:36:19,463
Come o-onn.

1177
01:36:22,556 --> 01:36:25,168
Damn it, Goose. Pick a side.

1178
01:36:29,406 --> 01:36:31,140
Take them to the hangar, too.

1179
01:36:31,593 --> 01:36:33,242
We'll blast them all into space.

1180
01:36:35,713 --> 01:36:37,313
(?)

1181
01:36:37,994 --> 01:36:39,365
Just like Havana.

1182
01:36:40,778 --> 01:36:42,639
Do you have the thing?

1183
01:36:42,988 --> 01:36:44,707
The Flerken kitty ate it.

1184
01:36:58,175 --> 01:37:00,340
Come on. Move. Move.

1185
01:37:01,181 --> 01:37:02,772
Follow my lead.

1186
01:37:06,743 --> 01:37:07,812
Cover her eyes.

1187
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,657
Board the machine.

1188
01:37:17,682 --> 01:37:19,779
Let's go, let's go.

1189
01:37:42,893 --> 01:37:44,076
Nice diversion.

1190
01:37:44,612 --> 01:37:46,100
I could have swore I put it in there.

1191
01:38:43,539 --> 01:38:47,010
- Minn-Erva, take 'em down on a dropship.
- On it.

1192
01:38:51,414 --> 01:38:52,781
You alright, friend?

1193
01:38:53,263 --> 01:38:56,550
Never...
better.

1194
01:38:59,907 --> 01:39:02,608
We got a bogey. Comin' in hot.

1195
01:40:41,226 --> 01:40:42,558
- Ha ha ha!
- Yes! -Boom!

1196
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:00,809
Whooo!

1197
01:41:03,979 --> 01:41:05,398
What the hell was that?

1198
01:41:28,504 --> 01:41:31,474
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1199
01:42:23,093 --> 01:42:24,342
That's impossible.

1200
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:29,482
C-53 doesn't have the defense system
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

1201
01:42:30,863 --> 01:42:33,903
That's not their defense system, Ronan.

1202
01:42:37,994 --> 01:42:39,322
Take her down.

1203
01:43:49,773 --> 01:43:51,513
Return to the jump point.

1204
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:54,327
We'll be back for the weapon.

1205
01:43:56,182 --> 01:43:57,589
The core?

1206
01:43:59,454 --> 01:44:01,018
The woman.

1207
01:44:48,803 --> 01:44:50,632
I'm so proud of you.

1208
01:44:52,359 --> 01:44:55,853
You've come a long way since I
found you that day by the lake.

1209
01:44:56,698 --> 01:45:00,089
But can you keep your emotions in
check long enough to take me on?

1210
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:03,192
Or will they get the
better of you as always?

1211
01:45:05,098 --> 01:45:06,621
I always told you.

1212
01:45:06,646 --> 01:45:10,923
You'll be ready the day you
can knock me down as yourself.

1213
01:45:10,948 --> 01:45:14,885
This is that moment. THIS!
Is that moment, Vers.

1214
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:19,397
Turn off the lightshow and prove,
prove to me you can beat me a...

1215
01:45:34,697 --> 01:45:37,445
I have nothing to prove to you.

1216
01:45:52,726 --> 01:45:54,684
Destination. Hala.

1217
01:45:54,802 --> 01:45:56,870
I can't go back empty-handed.

1218
01:45:56,895 --> 01:46:00,273
You won't be empty-handed.
I'm sending you with a message.

1219
01:46:01,367 --> 01:46:04,470
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1220
01:46:04,584 --> 01:46:07,987
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1221
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,996
You can't do this.

1222
01:46:29,572 --> 01:46:34,309
That was a close call, huh, Goosey? Huh? 
<i>Meow</i>

1223
01:46:34,334 --> 01:46:35,836
Are the bad guys still
in there somewhere?

1224
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:36,878
Owww!

1225
01:46:36,879 --> 01:46:38,682
MOTHER FLERKEN!

1226
01:46:38,707 --> 01:46:41,511
- You okay?
- Yeah. 'Tis just a scratch.

1227
01:46:41,984 --> 01:46:42,984
No.

1228
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:55,631
I can't believe you got into the raddest god fight ever and you...

1229
01:46:55,656 --> 01:46:56,791
I'd say you arrived, just in time.

1230
01:46:56,816 --> 01:46:58,902
Some nifty flying you did out there.

1231
01:46:59,102 --> 01:47:01,787
S.H.I.E.L.D.
could always use a pilot like you.

1232
01:47:01,812 --> 01:47:06,643
I'll consider it. As long as you
don't call my flyin' "nifty" again.

1233
01:47:06,701 --> 01:47:09,804
- How's your eye?
- Mmm. It doesn't hurt this second(?).

1234
01:47:09,828 --> 01:47:11,477
Just so I'm clear.

1235
01:47:11,501 --> 01:47:14,520
You were Soh-Larr...AND
the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?

1236
01:47:14,735 --> 01:47:18,329
Talos, tagged my boss up. Stole his identity.

1237
01:47:18,354 --> 01:47:21,325
I borrowed his likeness. I'm not a thief.

1238
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:24,272
- It's a little like stealing.
- Whose side are you on?

1239
01:47:24,397 --> 01:47:26,582
You good to go here 'til you recover, but...

1240
01:47:26,723 --> 01:47:28,999
You and your family gonna need a new look.

1241
01:47:29,162 --> 01:47:30,913
I could go back to being your boss.

1242
01:47:30,937 --> 01:47:32,566
- Uh, please don't.
- Come on.

1243
01:47:32,567 --> 01:47:34,972
I loved sporting his beautiful blue eyes.

1244
01:47:35,172 --> 01:47:37,606
No way! You guys have the best eyes.

1245
01:47:37,631 --> 01:47:40,370
Don't ever change your eyes.

1246
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:47,428
I'll help you find a home.
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1247
01:47:48,891 --> 01:47:52,251
They can stay here with us.
Can't they, Mom?

1248
01:47:52,946 --> 01:47:54,710
They won't be safe here, baby.

1249
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:57,160
Auntie Carol is right.

1250
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,295
They need their own home.

1251
01:47:59,495 --> 01:48:01,497
I'll be back before you know it.

1252
01:48:01,697 --> 01:48:04,929
Maybe, I could fly up and meet you halfway?

1253
01:48:04,954 --> 01:48:07,904
Well, only if you learn to
glow like your Auntie Carol.

1254
01:48:07,929 --> 01:48:10,094
Or, maybe I'll build a spaceship.
You don't know!

1255
01:48:10,387 --> 01:48:11,554
He doesn't.

1256
01:48:20,607 --> 01:48:24,953
Keep the Tesseract on Earth. Hidden.

1257
01:48:25,021 --> 01:48:27,291
You sure that's what Mar-Vell would want?

1258
01:48:28,013 --> 01:48:30,316
- Mar-VELL
- That's what I said.

1259
01:48:30,663 --> 01:48:33,131
It's two words. MAR-VELL.

1260
01:48:33,156 --> 01:48:37,094
MAR-VELL. Marvel sounds a lot better.
You know, like the Marvelettes?

1261
01:48:40,432 --> 01:48:45,412
<i>♪ Wait, oh yes, wait a
minute, Mr. Postman ♪</i>

1262
01:48:45,437 --> 01:48:49,663
<i>♪ Wai-ai-ai-aiiit Mr. Postman ♪</i>

1263
01:48:51,012 --> 01:48:52,245
Not ringin' any bells?

1264
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:54,270
Keep singing.
Maybe it will come back to me.

1265
01:49:09,281 --> 01:49:10,794
I upgraded it.

1266
01:49:11,551 --> 01:49:14,522
Range should be...couple
galaxies, at least.

1267
01:49:16,832 --> 01:49:19,185
What? Think I'm gonna prank call you?

1268
01:49:19,376 --> 01:49:21,946
For emergencies only, okay?

1269
01:49:30,052 --> 01:49:32,496
Well, if you're ever passing back through this galaxy

1270
01:49:32,521 --> 01:49:34,606
be sure to give a brother a shout.

1271
01:49:50,869 --> 01:49:52,679
We got the ketchup stain off.

1272
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,215
Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

1273
01:50:09,676 --> 01:50:11,834
It's hard for me to say goodbye too.

1274
01:50:25,686 --> 01:50:27,031
Go on.

1275
01:51:34,045 --> 01:51:37,280
Glad to have you back, Sir.
This came for you.

1276
01:51:42,285 --> 01:51:43,852
So, is it true?

1277
01:51:43,876 --> 01:51:47,987
That the Kree burned your eye out because
you refused to give them the Tesseract?

1278
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:52,516
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1279
01:51:53,095 --> 01:51:54,095
Understood.

1280
01:51:55,464 --> 01:51:58,062
I'm sorry to report that we still
haven't found the Tesseract.

1281
01:51:58,087 --> 01:52:00,303
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

1282
01:52:02,094 --> 01:52:05,207
- I'll let you know when it does.
- Then what?

1283
01:52:05,407 --> 01:52:06,427
Sir?

1284
01:52:06,451 --> 01:52:10,715
We have no idea what other
intergalactic threats are out there.

1285
01:52:11,114 --> 01:52:16,117
And our one-woman security force have a prior
commitment on the other side of the universe.

1286
01:52:19,074 --> 01:52:21,323
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can't protect us.

1287
01:52:22,583 --> 01:52:24,429
We need to find more.

1288
01:52:24,883 --> 01:52:26,548
- More weapons?
- More...

1289
01:52:26,572 --> 01:52:27,572
heroes.

1290
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:29,217
You think you could
find others like her?

1291
01:52:29,241 --> 01:52:31,889
Well, we found her and
we weren't even looking.

1292
01:52:33,446 --> 01:52:34,891
Get some rest, sir.

1293
01:52:35,759 --> 01:52:37,494
We got a big decision to make.
