1
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:25,590
Where is it?

2
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:27,217
I don't know.

3
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,969
Where is the Black Sky?

4
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:40,022
You have three limbs left.

5
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:42,899
And other appendages no man wants to lose.

6
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:46,819
Where is the Black Sky?

7
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:48,405
It's gone.

8
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:51,658
They...

9
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,493
They put it on a ship.

10
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:55,787
Where's the ship headed?

11
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:58,248
New York City.

12
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:01,001
Swear to it.

13
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:03,045
Upon my family.

14
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:12,137
They're better off without you.

15
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,967
Devil, my shapely Irish ass.

16
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:36,263
Guy's a coward.

17
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:39,807
Would and I wouldn't give for the
chance to rip that corny mask off and...

18
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:42,310
And what?

19
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:44,479
Punch him... in the face...

20
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:47,399
with my... fisticuffs.

21
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:52,487
I don't know, he seems,
uh... pretty fisticuffy.

22
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,698
Please tell me I don't detect a hint
of admiration for that terrorist.

23
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:59,827
This is just all speculation. Nobody
knows if he's a terrorist or what.

24
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:01,913
You're absolutely right.
Terrorists have causes.

25
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:03,623
They claim responsibility.

26
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:07,585
Al-Qaeda wanted the world to know
exactly what kind of assholes they were.

27
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:09,921
This guy? Not a peep.

28
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:11,423
All terror without the "-ist."

29
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,466
You know what they call that? Nut job.

30
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:15,051
Hmm, maybe.

31
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:17,094
How's your side?

32
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:19,264
Downgraded to agony.

33
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:21,558
All right, what do you think, Matt?

34
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:25,187
I think Foggy'll be pitching
for the Mets by mid-season.

35
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,688
I'm being serious.

36
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,731
So am I. Have
you seen their bullpen?

37
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:32,277
Come on, you telling me this
dickhead blowing up our backyard

38
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,486
doesn't piss you off?

39
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,862
What happened to Hell's Kitchen,

40
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:38,491
to you and to Elena, and to
all the people that were hurt...

41
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:40,117
yeah, it pisses me off.

42
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:42,122
But this man, whoever he
is, whatever his motive,

43
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,164
he shouldn't be tried and
convicted in the press.

44
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:46,999
We're lawyers, we know that's
not how it's supposed to work.

45
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,420
So, uh, hypothetically,
if this guy got caught...

46
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:53,130
needed counsel, Nelson and
Murdock would offer to defend him?

47
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,257
Hell no.

48
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,800
It would be his right.

49
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:58,511
What about my right to
punch him in the melon?

50
00:04:58,595 --> 00:05:00,722
They pulled a piece of
glass out of my side.

51
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,807
Elena needed 12 stitches.

52
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,142
And you want to Perry
Mason the guy responsible?

53
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:07,645
I wanna make sure the right
person pays for what happened.

54
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,314
The whole thing's moot.

55
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:11,941
After shooting those cops, police
are probably looking to settle things

56
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,527
the old-fashioned way
if they catch up to him.

57
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:17,655
Yeah, it's more than likely.

58
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:22,202
Just a thought, but we may wanna go
a bit peppier at the end of the day.

59
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:25,497
Leave on a note slightly
higher than deeply depressing.

60
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:29,459
She's right. You're
bringing us down, Murdock.

61
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:30,585
Me?

62
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:35,465
High note! Softball!

63
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,300
When are we getting a
company team together?

64
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,427
We have three employees.

65
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,597
At least two of them aren't blind.

66
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,766
Naysayers, each and every one of you.

67
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:46,100
Karen, come on.

68
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:47,977
Batting practice, you
and me, Chelsea Piers.

69
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,187
- What do you say?
- Um, I...

70
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:52,524
Or not. Totally cool.

71
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:54,567
No, no, I would, I
would. It's just that I, um...

72
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,278
I have this, uh, thing.

73
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,530
Go, do that thing.

74
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:00,990
Not a problem.

75
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:04,201
Okay, so, um... see you tomorrow.

76
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:07,747
We'll be here, ready
to high note and stuff.

77
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,831
Good.

78
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:15,004
Smooth.

79
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:17,632
Admittedly, I'm a work in progress.

80
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,010
Did you know she has mace on her keychain?

81
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:22,304
Is that a bad thing?

82
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,263
You ever worry about her?

83
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:27,600
Worry, like, something
she's not telling us?

84
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:29,686
Everyone has secrets, Foggy.

85
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:32,355
I don't. I'd like some.

86
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,359
Your kind... like with
Hottie McBurner-Phone.

87
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:38,903
I mean, I assume she's hot. Is she hot?

88
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:40,405
Oh...

89
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:42,156
How would I know?

90
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,950
This again.

91
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,660
You always know.

92
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:47,119
I mean, you guys getting serious?

93
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:49,331
Should I dust off the
tux I'll need to rent?

94
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,836
No, uh... it didn't work out.

95
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:55,920
Oh.

96
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:58,590
I'm... I'm sorry, man.

97
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,132
Yeah, me too.

98
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:04,887
Hey, look, I'm gonna order in tonight,
get a jump on this tenement case.

99
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,389
You want me to stay?

100
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,391
No, I'll be all right. Thanks, buddy.

101
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:10,226
See you in the morning.

102
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,610
Hey, Matt...

103
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:21,070
her loss, man. Seriously.

104
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:30,830
Owlsley, Leland: Financial Advisor...

105
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:33,165
at the prestigious firm
of Silver & Brent...

106
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,428
The funds have been
reallocated as requested.

107
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,722
All the arrangements
made per your agreement

108
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:50,266
with the guy we're not
supposed to blah blah blah.

109
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,018
Business may continue?

110
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:56,272
In the best possible way... uninterrupted.

111
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:59,734
So, uh, what are you going
to do with it when it arrives?

112
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:04,697
What, you think I'm a
doddering pencil pusher

113
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:10,161
who moves enormous amounts of money with
no clue as to what it's connected to?

114
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:13,915
The numbers are like tea leaves.

115
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:16,208
Nobody reads them like I can.

116
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,631
You're laying out major
reserves to clear the docks...

117
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:25,885
to make sure the police
don't come within 10 blocks.

118
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:28,638
More to bribe the comptrollers

119
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,307
to guarantee straight greens.

120
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:35,102
Know how much all that costs?

121
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:36,228
I do.

122
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:39,065
There is a point to all your words?

123
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,443
Yeah, I got a...

124
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:48,491
What happened to the Russians...

125
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:51,536
We need to be careful, all of us.

126
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:55,582
I look out for you... you look out for me.

127
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,916
All I'm saying.

128
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:03,380
Each man must stand... for himself...

129
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:06,008
or fall with the unworthy.

130
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,970
What the hell does that mean?

131
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:19,481
Prick.

132
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:27,697
Oh, God!

133
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,907
What do you want? My wallet?

134
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:33,160
You know what I want. Tell
me about the man you work for.

135
00:09:33,244 --> 00:09:36,956
I work for Silver & Brent.

136
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:40,001
I'm gonna ask you again.

137
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,463
Think about your answer.

138
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:47,049
Who do you work for?

139
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,844
I told you, I work for Silver and...

140
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:55,016
You work for Wilson Fisk...

141
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:57,810
moving his money around.

142
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:00,980
Which means you have
records, proof of who...

143
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:10,281
Asshole.

144
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,808
You just gonna lie there all night?

145
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:51,363
He's getting worse.

146
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:56,410
When we first took him in, Matthew's
problems seemed less severe.

147
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:58,830
Now he's in so much pain.

148
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:04,501
Doctors, clergy, no one has
any idea what's wrong with him.

149
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:07,630
We heard about your work
with special children

150
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:09,757
and thought maybe you could help.

151
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,300
Not for free.

152
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:15,262
His father left a sizeable inheritance.

153
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:17,556
What about the mother? Is she dead?

154
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,516
No, she's...

155
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:22,645
Well, that's another story. Here we are.

156
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:29,318
Make the check out to cash.
I'll take it from here.

157
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:41,580
They think you're getting worse.

158
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:45,918
But... you're not, are you, kid?

159
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,092
You're getting stronger.

160
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:56,303
Let's get started.

161
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:01,768
So what kind of training is this?

162
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,728
You like ice cream?

163
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:05,437
Yeah.

164
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:09,358
Then shut up and eat it.
I'll ask the questions.

165
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,862
First thing you gotta understand is

166
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:16,991
nobody feels sorry for
you and nobody ever will.

167
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:21,162
'Cause when it comes to being born lucky...

168
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:23,247
you won the friggin' lottery.

169
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,415
I did?

170
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:27,584
What did I say about questions?

171
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:28,836
"Shut up."

172
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:30,922
Good.

173
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:35,092
How old were you when you got blinded?

174
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:37,053
- Nine.
- Nine?

175
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:42,016
So you had nine whole
years of looking at movies,

176
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:45,853
blue skies, up girlies'
skirts that I never had.

177
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:48,564
I was born blind.

178
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:51,025
You don't hear me whining about it, do you?

179
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:52,151
No.

180
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:57,656
So, you're nine years old, walking
along, minding your own business

181
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,909
and whammo!

182
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:03,495
Get hit by a truck,
killed dead on the spot.

183
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:04,997
I wasn't killed.

184
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,415
You lived?

185
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:08,167
Praise God, it's a miracle.

186
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,170
So you survive the truck

187
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:14,673
and get this chemical shit in your eyes.

188
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:15,800
What next?

189
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,634
I hear things.

190
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,345
What kind of things?

191
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:20,471
Everything.

192
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:24,100
Coughs and fights and cats meowing.

193
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,018
Sometimes blocks away.

194
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:27,144
I can sense things.

195
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,688
I know where things are and when they move.

196
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:32,191
But I can't see.

197
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:35,444
You know what they call stuff like that?

198
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:36,653
Gifts.

199
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:39,365
The special kind.

200
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:42,451
The kind that very few people have.

201
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:44,703
Or deserve.

202
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:46,413
I never thought of it that way.

203
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:48,457
Well, that's because you're stupid.

204
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,084
I'm not stupid, I'm smart.

205
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,668
Because you taught yourself

206
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:55,464
how to run your little fingers
over the bumps and read Braille?

207
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:58,134
Smart don't come out of books, kid.

208
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:03,097
Smart is making the right
decision at the right time.

209
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,308
Like now.

210
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:08,435
What's it gonna be, Matty?

211
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,024
You gonna spend your life crying and
rocking yourself to sleep at night?

212
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:15,985
Or are you gonna dig deep

213
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:20,782
and find out what it takes to
reshuffle those cards life dealt you?

214
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:23,534
Your call.

215
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:30,332
Good choice, kid.

216
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,421
No one's bought me ice
cream since my dad died.

217
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:37,048
What's it taste like?

218
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:39,091
Vanilla.

219
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:41,969
Everybody can taste vanilla.

220
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:45,848
Pay a little more
attention, use those gifts.

221
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,767
You know what you got?

222
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:51,353
Sugar grains, vanilla bean,

223
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:56,442
milk from three different
dairies from two states...

224
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,155
ugh...

225
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:04,951
batch of chemicals straight
off the periodic tables and...

226
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,956
dirt off the guy's hand
that served it to you.

227
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:14,085
He spent his morning gardening.

228
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:18,172
Whole world around you,
Matty, and it is friggin' huge.

229
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:19,966
And all you need...

230
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:23,094
are the guts to let it in.

231
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:24,720
Try.

232
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:28,140
That dog, what's his story?

233
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,393
He's hungry...

234
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:32,937
his stomach's growling...

235
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:37,817
and he's dying to eat the hot dogs
that guy's carrying just upwind of him.

236
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:41,278
Not bad.

237
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:43,655
What about the girl?

238
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,119
Her skin's... Her skin's too hot.

239
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,748
Her heart's beating fast.

240
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,125
Is she sick?

241
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,918
Worse.

242
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,378
She's in love.

243
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,963
And the old man?

244
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:05,177
He's...

245
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:08,848
He's dying.

246
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,433
And there's nothing you can do about it.

247
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:17,857
Big world... not all of
it flowers and sunshine.

248
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:24,113
And the only way guys
like you and me can survive

249
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:27,992
is to grab it by the
throat and never let go.

250
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:31,578
If I ask you a
question, will you hit me?

251
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:33,747
Depends on the question.

252
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,918
How did you find me? How did you know?

253
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:40,546
Old bitty at the orphanage
thinks it's her idea.

254
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:42,464
But it wasn't, was it?

255
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,427
Maybe it's one of my gifts.

256
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,845
Or you just got lucky.

257
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,514
That's not an answer.

258
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:55,227
You catch on quick.

259
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:58,898
You're going to help me?

260
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,442
No, I'm gonna train you.

261
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:06,530
How to control your gift,
make it work for you...

262
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:09,951
use it, and how to fight.

263
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:11,953
My dad never wanted me to fight.

264
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:15,206
Your dad ain't here. You'll
need skills for the war.

265
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:16,623
What war?

266
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:21,337
We'll get to that
part... when you're ready.

267
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,630
I don't even know your
name. What do I call you?

268
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:25,216
Stick.

269
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:28,885
Are you gonna lie there all
night or get up off your ass?

270
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:30,972
Jesus, kid.

271
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:34,308
I'm gone five minutes, you turn
this place into a shit show.

272
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:35,684
You've been gone 20 years.

273
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,229
What are you doing back in my city?

274
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:40,314
Your city?

275
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:42,649
Hell's Kitchen hates your guts.

276
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:46,570
They have you pegged as a cop
killer and some kind of mad bomber.

277
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:47,904
Yeah, I'm taking care of it.

278
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:49,740
An old guy just lit you up.

279
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,575
You ain't taking care of shit.

280
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,327
Why are you here?

281
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,329
To save you...

282
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:58,707
and everyone in the Kitchen
from a horrible death.

283
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,877
More or less.

284
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:07,841
Paper trail on Union Allied's a bust.

285
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:09,385
Whoever's pulling the strings

286
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:12,304
busted up the one big corporation
into a bunch of little ones.

287
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:13,805
It's an old game.

288
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:16,850
Spread the records far and
wide, discourage investigation.

289
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,935
God. I mean, it's like...

290
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,273
It's like trying to straighten
out a bowl of spaghetti.

291
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:24,316
Well, you could always let it go.

292
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:27,694
Not gonna happen.

293
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:29,113
I already told you that.

294
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:32,158
Stop complaining. This is the job.

295
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,910
Researching, gathering facts.

296
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:38,830
It's long and boring and complicated,
and half the time you still come up empty.

297
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,377
Well, you're just a little ray of sunshine.

298
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,296
Just giving you the lay of the land.

299
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:50,717
For every exposé I've had published,
there were a dozen that didn't pan out.

300
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,511
All right, all right, so I'm
the new girl on the block,

301
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:54,513
I don't know what I'm doing, I get it.

302
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:02,146
What about you? What'd you find?

303
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,650
Ah, bits and pieces. Yakuza...

304
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:09,278
Wait, the Japanese mafia?

305
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,906
Triads, too. Drugs, I think.

306
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,412
Then there's the bombings
that took out the Russians.

307
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:22,499
And you think it's all
connected to Union Allied?

308
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,959
Doesn't matter what I think.

309
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:25,877
Only matters what I can prove.

310
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:29,756
Wait, what about the cops that got shot?

311
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,551
I mean, you really think
that was the guy in the mask?

312
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:39,015
I was standing right next to
one of them when it happened.

313
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,394
Detective named Blake.

314
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,815
Didn't like each other very much.

315
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:48,775
Yeah, I met him...

316
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:51,237
when they brought me into the precinct.

317
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,989
I see why you didn't get along.

318
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,200
Did what I could.

319
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:58,702
If he comes out of a coma, maybe...

320
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:02,664
maybe he'll thank me, tell me
what really happened out there.

321
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,666
Till then...

322
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,128
the man in the mask pops up...

323
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:09,963
do me a favor, run the other way.

324
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,509
He saved my life, Ben.

325
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:17,429
How do you know he wasn't
there just to, um...

326
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,931
hurt somebody else?

327
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:26,062
I... I never... never
thought about it like that.

328
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:30,901
My experience... there
are no heroes, no villains.

329
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,528
Just people with different agendas.

330
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,321
Yeah, and one of those was to kill me.

331
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:35,656
Mmm-hmm.

332
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:36,782
It was.

333
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:39,618
And you're not careful, maybe
they'll want a second crack at it.

334
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:45,291
The only way I'll ever feel safe again

335
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:48,294
is if the people that you are
talking about are put away.

336
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:51,297
Then we better try harder to
straighten out that spaghetti.

337
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,426
So...

338
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,137
if we can connect...

339
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,058
the tenements, and the
shootings, and Union Allied...

340
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:06,187
that something you'd take to your editor?

341
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:09,523
Yeah.

342
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:11,650
Probably bring home a Pulitzer.

343
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,444
But, uh, I think it's a long shot.

344
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:17,448
Well, I was a mean three-point shooter
on my high school basketball team.

345
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:19,658
I like the long shots.

346
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:21,535
This isn't a game, Karen.

347
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:23,912
I... I know that.

348
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:27,999
Anything happens to
you... it's gonna be on me,

349
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,710
and, uh...

350
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:35,006
I don't want to be responsible for that.

351
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,802
I can't.

352
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:42,973
I'll be okay.

353
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,852
They're not gonna win.

354
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:23,597
What a shithole.

355
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:26,517
You have any idea what I pay in rent?

356
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,226
Expensive shithole.

357
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:30,812
You had a woman in here.

358
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:32,063
That's none of your business.

359
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:34,316
When's she coming back?

360
00:22:35,191 --> 00:22:36,860
- Never.
- Good.

361
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:39,783
You got a warped perspective on the
whole good/bad thing, you know that?

362
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:42,949
Women are a distraction.

363
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:48,330
Just like... furniture, apartments...

364
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,374
Whoa.

365
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:54,085
Silk sheets.

366
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,422
Cotton feels like sandpaper on my skin.

367
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,301
You'd be better off
sleeping on real sandpaper

368
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:03,053
than surrounding yourself
with all this bullshit.

369
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:06,181
This is my life and I made
something of it, without you.

370
00:23:06,264 --> 00:23:08,392
That's the part that really
pisses you off, isn't it?

371
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:12,228
No, Matty. No, I'm proud
of you, I really am.

372
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:16,317
The things you've done, what
you've made of yourself, but...

373
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:18,652
this is...

374
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:23,740
Surrounding yourself with soft
stuff isn't life, it's death.

375
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:27,828
Someday those silk sheets
are gonna crawl up behind you,

376
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:31,289
wrap themselves around your
throat and choke you to death.

377
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:32,458
You're a warrior.

378
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah...

379
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:35,336
that's not all I am.

380
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:40,382
A warrior, heir to the Spartans,
baddest of the bad-asses.

381
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:42,468
They knew what they had
to do and they did it.

382
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,594
And what was that?

383
00:23:43,677 --> 00:23:46,137
Cut it loose, all of it.

384
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:49,475
Cut yourself free...

385
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,811
from the women, the
comforts, the fancy job.

386
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:54,938
The job's not that fancy.

387
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:57,691
Do you have friends? People you care about?

388
00:23:57,774 --> 00:23:59,275
Yeah, two.

389
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,487
Cut 'em loose, for their sake.

390
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,365
Break their hearts if you
have to, just do it quick.

391
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:05,616
I'm not gonna do that.

392
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:08,535
Then they will suffer and you will die.

393
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:13,499
Relationships are a luxury men
like you and me can't afford.

394
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:15,000
Is that why you left?

395
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:18,670
Huh? To protect me?

396
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:20,422
I had my reasons.

397
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:21,923
I was a kid.

398
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,593
You still are.

399
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,804
"Boo-hoo. Stick left me.

400
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:31,141
Think I'll bury my sorrows
between the legs of a supermodel."

401
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:32,308
Don't push it, Stick.

402
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:34,310
Or what?

403
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:36,563
I'm trying to teach you how to stay alive.

404
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:38,732
Christ, you're worse than your old man.

405
00:24:38,815 --> 00:24:41,402
Born to lose Battlin' Jack.

406
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:44,488
At least your daddy got
paid when he hit the floor.

407
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:48,241
You're hurting me.

408
00:24:48,324 --> 00:24:50,368
Make me stop.

409
00:24:50,452 --> 00:24:52,287
- I can't.
- Then quit.

410
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,164
Murdocks never quit.

411
00:24:58,293 --> 00:24:59,420
Then beat me.

412
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:03,424
I've got all day, kid.

413
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:06,635
You're just a bully.

414
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:10,639
World's full of 'em. What
are you gonna do about it?

415
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,141
Feel the breeze.

416
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,355
You got heart, kid.

417
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:21,775
But heart's not enough.

418
00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:24,110
You've got to control that rage.

419
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:25,403
You said anger's a weapon.

420
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,948
Anger is a spark, good.

421
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:33,537
Rage is a wildfire, out of
control, therefore useless.

422
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,664
Just like you laying there.

423
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,926
I thought Murdocks never quit.

424
00:25:50,303 --> 00:25:52,889
It's my fault! It's my fault!

425
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:54,475
I did it, I killed him!

426
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:55,601
Killed who?

427
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,393
My dad.

428
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:01,898
They paid him to lose against Creel.

429
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:04,568
But... But I wanted him to win.

430
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:06,361
So he did because of me.

431
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:08,196
Because of me.

432
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:11,992
I just wanted him to come home.

433
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:14,327
But he didn't, and he never will.

434
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,038
We all pay for our choices, kid.

435
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:22,168
Maybe your old man fought for
you, maybe he did it for himself.

436
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:26,089
The only thing you know
for sure is he's gone now.

437
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:28,967
But I'm here.

438
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,262
Now, get up.

439
00:26:32,345 --> 00:26:35,682
Time to stop taking a
beating and start giving one.

440
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,227
Get up.

441
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:43,273
Get up.

442
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,359
Get up!

443
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,496
Come on, kid. Show me
I'm not wasting my time.

444
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,682
Took you 20 years to learn
how to get out of that one.

445
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:19,350
Yeah, I've learned a lot
since you've been gone.

446
00:27:19,434 --> 00:27:20,936
- Like what?
- You're a dick.

447
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:23,104
That's true.

448
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:24,439
You got any beer?

449
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,817
Yeah, in the fridge.

450
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:29,485
I'll bet...

451
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:34,074
it's that German piss, isn't it?

452
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:37,535
So you gonna tell me why you're here?

453
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:40,330
Or is the suspense supposed to kill me?

454
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:43,458
It's the war, Matty.

455
00:27:47,754 --> 00:27:49,214
Never-ending war.

456
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:51,424
With who? You never
got around to that part.

457
00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:54,761
Now, the Japanese, mostly.

458
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:58,431
Look, I don't want you tearing up
Hell's Kitchen going after the yakuza.

459
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:00,016
Yakuza?

460
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:03,812
You don't know what's going
on in your own backyard.

461
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:07,190
The guy that was yappin' with
that old man you slapped around,

462
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:08,399
he's pretty high up.

463
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:12,237
He goes by a lot of names.
Using Nobu this time around.

464
00:28:13,404 --> 00:28:14,530
So, Nobu,

465
00:28:14,615 --> 00:28:16,992
you want him so bad, why'd you let
him get away back in the garage?

466
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:18,534
I don't want him.

467
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:22,038
I want what's on the ship he's
meeting at the docks tonight.

468
00:28:22,122 --> 00:28:24,249
Right, Owlsley was talking about that.

469
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,669
What's Nobu bringing
in? Drugs or something?

470
00:28:27,753 --> 00:28:29,420
A weapon.

471
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:32,340
They call it Black Sky,
the bringer of shadows.

472
00:28:32,423 --> 00:28:33,424
What kind of weapon?

473
00:28:33,508 --> 00:28:36,094
The kind you don't want in your world.

474
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:38,805
Just say it.

475
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:40,932
- Say what?
- Say that you want my help.

476
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:43,434
I want you to help yourself.

477
00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:46,104
Nobu and his guys are in tight with Fisk.

478
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:48,564
You hurt them, you hurt baldy...

479
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:50,566
You know about Fisk?

480
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:51,943
I know a lot of shit.

481
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:55,030
This beer, for example, sucks.

482
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:59,075
After all your talk about
cutting friends loose, and...

483
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,952
now you need one.

484
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:04,665
I don't need a friend. I
need a soldier. Committed.

485
00:29:04,748 --> 00:29:07,709
Not some bleeding heart idealist
hanging onto half measures.

486
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:10,461
You don't know anything
about what I'm doing here.

487
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:13,256
Kid, in war, people die.

488
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:16,176
If it's not you, it's the guy next to you.

489
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:22,724
How many men have you
killed protecting this city?

490
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:29,815
You're still afraid to cross that line.

491
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:33,359
Someday, it's gonna come
down to you or the other guy.

492
00:29:33,443 --> 00:29:35,862
If it's not Fisk, somebody else.

493
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:37,530
What're you gonna do then?

494
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:40,992
Yeah, a Russian asshole asked
me the same thing recently...

495
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:42,452
right before he died.

496
00:29:42,535 --> 00:29:44,996
Are you the one that put him in the ground?

497
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:46,581
No.

498
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,001
Half measures, Matty.

499
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,546
Ah, screw it.

500
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:57,258
Ride with me tonight...

501
00:29:57,342 --> 00:30:00,428
help me destroy Black Sky,
keep it off the streets,

502
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:02,555
and I promise you this...

503
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:06,351
Wilson Fisk will know the taste
of fear the day he faces you

504
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:09,980
'cause he'll know that you
kicked the guy he's afraid of

505
00:30:10,063 --> 00:30:11,732
right in the nuts.

506
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:14,860
What do you say, kid?

507
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,612
One rule...

508
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:19,865
you don't kill anybody.

509
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:26,621
I swear I will not kill anybody.

510
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,376
Pussy.

511
00:30:37,173 --> 00:30:38,299
Uh...

512
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:41,219
How's your head?

513
00:30:41,302 --> 00:30:42,637
I'm alive.

514
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:44,597
It's enough.

515
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:47,934
How much do I owe you for the groceries?

516
00:30:48,018 --> 00:30:51,479
No, no,
no, no, no. Put that away.

517
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:53,314
I don't want your money.

518
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:55,734
No, I don't take charity.

519
00:30:55,817 --> 00:30:57,568
All right.

520
00:30:57,652 --> 00:31:00,238
You can pay me if you want...

521
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:01,656
with information?

522
00:31:02,198 --> 00:31:03,950
What can I tell you?

523
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:06,870
A lot, I hope.

524
00:31:08,704 --> 00:31:12,625
I'm working on a legal case...

525
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:14,627
Oh, yes, yes...

526
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,838
with the handsome lawyer.

527
00:31:18,423 --> 00:31:20,550
Yeah, um, Matt.

528
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:23,178
No, Mr. Foggy.

529
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:24,470
Oh.

530
00:31:24,554 --> 00:31:26,389
You
think Foggy is handsome?

531
00:31:27,682 --> 00:31:30,435
I see the way he looks at you.

532
00:31:30,518 --> 00:31:33,563
Never is a man more good looking

533
00:31:33,646 --> 00:31:35,731
than when he is in love.

534
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:38,944
Oh, Christ.

535
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:40,611
Oh, uh...

536
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:43,239
I'm sorry.

537
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:46,034
Um...

538
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:49,204
Moving on, um...

539
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:55,001
I'm
trying to make a connection...

540
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:59,505
between a construction company

541
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:04,385
and the repairman that
did this to your apartment.

542
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:08,098
Why don't you ask Mr. Tully?

543
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:10,100
He sent them.

544
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:12,853
I can't find him.

545
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:17,523
His lawyers say he's on vacation.

546
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:21,069
I live like this

547
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:25,448
and that fat shit is lying on a beach?

548
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:27,575
Ugh. Oh.

549
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:28,659
Excuse me.

550
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:30,120
No, no.

551
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:31,872
I think...

552
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:34,249
it's pretty damn appropriate in this case.

553
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:40,546
Do you have papers from the repairs?

554
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,298
Receipts? Anything you had to...

555
00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:43,383
Sign?

556
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:44,843
No, I'm sorry.

557
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:48,471
I just called Mr. Tully,
and he sent them over.

558
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:50,265
Can you tell me what they looked like?

559
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:51,807
Yes.

560
00:32:51,892 --> 00:32:53,184
One was bald.

561
00:32:53,268 --> 00:32:54,269
Okay.

562
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:59,024
And the other
had a big tattoo on his arm.

563
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:01,151
A tattoo?

564
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:02,235
Of what?

565
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,238
Not a picture.

566
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:07,908
It was like a...

567
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:09,575
pattern.

568
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,370
Ugly. Went up to his neck.

569
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:14,873
Thank God he's no son of mine.

570
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:18,334
Thank you, Elena.

571
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:20,545
That might help.

572
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:26,176
All of this makes me worry.

573
00:33:26,927 --> 00:33:28,678
No.

574
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:29,971
No, no, no. Elena...

575
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:31,389
They...

576
00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:34,184
They're the ones that should be worried.

577
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:37,312
If I can find a connection...

578
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:40,815
to the men that did this and the company...

579
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,359
...then we
will have their dicks in a vice.

580
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:45,236
Sorry.

581
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,405
How long
have you been like this,

582
00:33:47,488 --> 00:33:48,531
Miss Page?

583
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:50,325
Um...

584
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:52,868
Ever since...

585
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:55,956
I got to New York.

586
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,082
Oh.

587
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,460
Adiós.

588
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:42,377
So, why you bothering the old woman?

589
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,129
Get off of me!

590
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,965
- Ahh!
- She gonna spray you.

591
00:34:47,048 --> 00:34:50,260
Maybe I take that away from you,
empty the whole thing in your face.

592
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:53,223
Burn your eyes out so you don't go
snooping where you're not supposed to.

593
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:56,349
- Ahh!
- Stupid bitch!

594
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:05,400
Foggy? Oh, my God.

595
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:08,653
Wait... what are you doing here?

596
00:35:08,736 --> 00:35:10,405
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

597
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:12,448
- What are you doing here?
- Are you following me?

598
00:35:12,532 --> 00:35:13,908
- Yeah.
- Why?

599
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:16,827
Because you were acting
weird. I was worried about you.

600
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:22,042
I can take care of myself.

601
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,669
Let's discuss that away
from the maniacs, okay?

602
00:35:24,752 --> 00:35:26,962
- Come on!
- Oh, shit.

603
00:35:51,904 --> 00:35:53,656
How many do you read?

604
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:57,035
I'm picking up a dozen heartbeats.

605
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,330
Slow, steady, not even a flutter.

606
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:03,249
There's one more.

607
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:05,376
Stronger...

608
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:07,920
different.

609
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:09,839
Nobu.

610
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:13,343
They're armed.
MP7s with suppressors.

611
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:15,136
Huh.

612
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,887
Somebody wants things quiet.

613
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:18,723
We'll be quieter.

614
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:24,145
- You remember how to use these?
- I won't need 'em.

615
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:25,313
Yeah, you will.

616
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:28,149
Thin out the herd.

617
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,860
- I'll take care of the Black Sky.
- How?

618
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:33,613
Just do your job, I'll do mine. Move.

619
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:37,737
Kill him!

620
00:38:43,826 --> 00:38:45,077
Go!

621
00:39:12,062 --> 00:39:13,147
Break.

622
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:15,400
What rules the body?

623
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:16,526
My mind.

624
00:39:18,778 --> 00:39:20,738
What's your strongest weapon?

625
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:21,906
My body.

626
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:31,624
Connection, mind, body?

627
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:35,545
The mind controls the body,
the body controls our enemies,

628
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:38,839
our enemies control jack shit
by the time we're done with them.

629
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:40,174
Right.

630
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:45,638
Fighting is just the start.

631
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:51,269
You have to control your feelings...

632
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:53,854
your deep down inside feelings.

633
00:39:53,938 --> 00:39:56,441
- How?
- Meditate.

634
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:58,901
You mean that thing where
you pretend not to sleep?

635
00:40:00,653 --> 00:40:03,323
Yeah. Yeah, that one.

636
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:08,118
Open yourself up to it... learn it,

637
00:40:08,202 --> 00:40:11,414
make you way stronger, more focused.

638
00:40:12,332 --> 00:40:14,625
Even heal your wounds faster.

639
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:15,751
You can do that?

640
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:17,878
How do you think I'm still alive, kid?

641
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:19,880
I'll learn how, just like you.

642
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:21,632
Good.

643
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:24,259
Tomorrow we start with knives.

644
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:26,387
Try not to get stabbed.

645
00:40:27,388 --> 00:40:29,349
- Stick?
- Yeah?

646
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:32,893
I have something for you.

647
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:40,526
It's a bracelet.

648
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:45,197
From the wrapper on the ice cream
you got me when we first met.

649
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:47,867
You remember?

650
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:50,370
I do.

651
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:02,214
Your training is over.

652
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:05,385
I can't help you anymore.

653
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:11,974
What?

654
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:14,268
Why?

655
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,439
I expected too much of you.

656
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:00,440
You promised me you
weren't gonna kill anyone.

657
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:02,191
Yep.

658
00:42:04,193 --> 00:42:06,236
Then what the hell was that back there?

659
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,738
The mission.

660
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,327
That's what your war's
come to? Killing children?

661
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:16,789
That thing in the
container was not a child.

662
00:42:16,872 --> 00:42:18,290
I could hear his heartbeat.

663
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:21,126
It was light and fast. He
hadn't even hit puberty.

664
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,671
- You're emotional.
- Yeah, no shit.

665
00:42:25,047 --> 00:42:28,759
If you'd have focused
beyond your crybaby feelings,

666
00:42:28,843 --> 00:42:31,011
you would've sensed
what that kid really was.

667
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:32,763
He was just a kid.

668
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:35,975
You're blind as you ever were.

669
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:39,854
Maybe you should've stuck around
and finished training me yourself.

670
00:42:39,937 --> 00:42:43,148
I needed a soldier. You wanted a father.

671
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:46,569
Well, I guess we're both disappointed then.

672
00:42:46,652 --> 00:42:48,237
I guess we are.

673
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,618
You take care of yourself, Matty.

674
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:55,327
I'm not gonna let you kill that kid.

675
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,955
Oh, he's already dead.

676
00:42:58,038 --> 00:43:02,292
I caught up with the van while you
were dicking around with Nobu's men.

677
00:43:03,418 --> 00:43:05,505
I put an arrow in that thing's heart.

678
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,313
You can't even tag an old man.

679
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,050
Get up.

680
00:43:55,513 --> 00:43:56,722
Get up!

681
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:02,603
Get up!

682
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,999
Get out of my city.

683
00:45:13,173 --> 00:45:15,550
Maybe there's hope for you yet.

684
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:30,650
Nice catching up.

685
00:45:31,316 --> 00:45:32,359
Eh?

686
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:36,947
You can keep the sticks.
You're gonna need 'em.

687
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:52,337
What part of "Don't tell anyone
about this" didn't you understand?

688
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:54,089
Foggy's not just anyone... all right?

689
00:45:54,173 --> 00:45:55,590
He's a kick-ass attorney,

690
00:45:55,675 --> 00:45:57,635
and sooner or later we're
gonna need one of those.

691
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:00,763
And he just plain kicks ass.

692
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:03,473
When the need arises.

693
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:07,144
You can trust him, Ben.

694
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:09,271
He's one of the good ones.

695
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:13,358
Show him the board.

696
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:17,362
All right, Ben has everything laid out...

697
00:46:17,446 --> 00:46:22,076
all of the, uh, possible
connections... starting at the bottom...

698
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,453
and moving up.

699
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:26,580
The king of diamonds?

700
00:46:26,663 --> 00:46:28,248
The man at the top.

701
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:29,792
Any idea who he is?

702
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,210
No.

703
00:46:31,293 --> 00:46:33,670
But I think he might have been
the one behind Union Allied.

704
00:46:33,754 --> 00:46:36,298
There's another player on the field.

705
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:38,759
Man in black.

706
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:41,095
You think he's working for the king?

707
00:46:41,178 --> 00:46:42,471
No.

708
00:46:42,554 --> 00:46:46,558
No, he never would have helped
me expose Union Allied if he were.

709
00:46:47,893 --> 00:46:49,478
If that's the case...

710
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,314
they're working against each other.

711
00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:55,150
So the question is...

712
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,156
which one trumps the other?

713
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:09,391
It's done.

714
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:11,643
Black Sky...

715
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:15,064
no longer a threat.

716
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:18,358
For now.

717
00:48:18,442 --> 00:48:20,194
What about Murdock?

718
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:25,782
Stubborn, immature...

719
00:48:28,535 --> 00:48:31,080
Still a real pain in the ass.

720
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:34,541
Will he be ready when the doors open?

721
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:44,468
I have no idea.
