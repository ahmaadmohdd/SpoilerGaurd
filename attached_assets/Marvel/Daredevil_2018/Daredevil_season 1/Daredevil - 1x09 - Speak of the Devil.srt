1
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:29,481
Ahhh!

2
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:15,653
Ahh!

3
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:26,914
Ahhh!

4
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:57,254
Started to wonder if
you'd ever turn up again.

5
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,633
Yeah, I've, uh...

6
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,135
- been busy.
- Hmm.

7
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:07,639
Well, I'll be inside,
you wanna take confession.

8
00:03:11,518 --> 00:03:12,644
Uh, Father?

9
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:21,779
I was wondering if I could
take you up on that latte?

10
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,222
Sugar?

11
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,266
No.

12
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,356
So...

13
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:03,653
what's on your mind, Matthew?

14
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:08,408
Wasn't that hard to find out.

15
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:14,331
People still remember "Battlin'
Jack" Murdock around these parts...

16
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,624
and what happened to his son.

17
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:23,215
Seal of confession still
applies, even over lattes.

18
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:25,050
That what you're worried about.

19
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:30,263
Do you believe in the Devil, Father?

20
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:35,894
You mean... as a concept?

21
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:36,979
No.

22
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,773
Do you believe he exists?

23
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:44,611
In this world, among us.

24
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,823
You want the short answer or the long one?

25
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,492
Just the truth.

26
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,707
When I was in seminary...

27
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:01,920
I was more studious than pious, more...

28
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:05,883
skeptical than most of my peers.

29
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,968
I had this notion...

30
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:11,221
which I was more than willing
to speak about, at length,

31
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:13,806
to whoever I could corner...

32
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:16,226
that the Devil...

33
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:17,644
was inconsequential.

34
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,064
Minor figure in the grand scheme.

35
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:24,109
Not very Catholic of you.

36
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,610
Uh-huh, yeah.

37
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:31,783
In my defense, in the scriptures,
the Hebrew word "Satan"

38
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,701
actually means "adversary."

39
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:37,330
It's applied to any antagonist.

40
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:41,126
Angels and humans, serpents and kings.

41
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,878
Medieval theologians
reinterpreted those passages

42
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:47,465
to be about a single monstrous enemy.

43
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,096
And, in my youthful zeal,
I was certain I knew why...

44
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,306
propaganda.

45
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,685
Played up to drive people into the church.

46
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:00,187
So you don't believe he exists.

47
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,980
Am I done talking?

48
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:05,483
Sorry.

49
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,196
Years later, I was in Rwanda...

50
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,117
trying to help local churches
provide aid and sanctuary to refugees.

51
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,663
I'd become close with the village elder,

52
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,333
Gahiji.

53
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:26,421
He and his family had the respect
of everybody, Hutu and Tutsi alike.

54
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:30,968
He'd helped them all...
through famines, disease.

55
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:38,641
The militia liked to force Hutu
villagers to murder their neighbors...

56
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:41,979
with machetes.

57
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:46,649
But nobody would raise
a hand against Gahiji.

58
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:50,778
They said, "Well... how can
we kill such a holy man?"

59
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:55,200
So the militia commander sent soldiers...

60
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:58,036
with orders to cut his head off...

61
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,831
in front of the entire village.

62
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,752
Gahiji didn't try to put up a fight.

63
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:10,007
Just asked for the chance
to say goodbye to his family.

64
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:15,470
By the time he was done, even the
soldiers didn't wanna kill him.

65
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:18,556
So they went to their commander
and asked permission to shoot him.

66
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,434
At least give him a quick death.

67
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,649
The commander wanted to meet this man...

68
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:31,486
who had won the respect of so many.

69
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:34,739
He went to Gahiji...

70
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:40,162
talked with him in his
hut... for many hours.

71
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:47,877
Then he dragged him out in front of
his village and hacked him to pieces...

72
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,590
along with his entire family.

73
00:07:57,095 --> 00:07:59,931
In that man who took Gahiji's life...

74
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,725
I saw the Devil.

75
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:07,564
So yes, Matthew...

76
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:12,485
I believe he walks among us...

77
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:15,905
taking many forms.

78
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:22,204
What if you could have stopped him...

79
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:26,124
from ever hurting anyone again?

80
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:29,377
Stopped him how?

81
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:34,841
This doesn't change anything, Ben.

82
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:37,927
Except now we know who
your king of diamonds is.

83
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,805
You see the news? Everything's changed.

84
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:47,687
Fisk has gotten out in front of
being dragged into the spotlight.

85
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,274
My editor thinks he's the Second
Coming. Hell, the whole city does.

86
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:52,817
So, we just... We keep digging.

87
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,980
I've been doing that.

88
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:55,987
Internet went from nothing on Fisk

89
00:08:56,071 --> 00:09:00,200
to filled with three-hanky stories about
a poor little fat kid from Hell's Kitchen.

90
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:03,203
Abandoned by his father when he
was 12. Mother died a year later.

91
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:07,124
Now look at him. Boot
straps and a big dream.

92
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:08,791
Somebody knows something.

93
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,918
It's just a matter of asking the
right people the right questions

94
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:12,082
in the right tone of voice.

95
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:15,006
Yeah, that's how you get yourself hurt.

96
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:19,051
That's what I keep telling them.

97
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:20,803
Maybe they'll listen to you.

98
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:24,474
Ben Urich, Matt Murdock.
Attorney at Why the Hell Bother.

99
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:29,396
- Mr. Murdock.
- Matt.

100
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:32,649
My partner thinks we should be
pursuing this through the legal system.

101
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:33,733
A lot safer that way.

102
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:35,777
Well, why don't we all just
crawl under the covers, then?

103
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,028
- No, Karen...
- Well, I'm sorry,

104
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:38,988
but if Fisk is really behind
everything that has happened,

105
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,532
then we need to do something.

106
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:44,119
If we were the only ones
after him, I'd tend to agree.

107
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:46,496
Friend of yours came to
see me the other night...

108
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:47,705
the man in the mask.

109
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:51,000
- Terrorist cop-killer.
- Says he was framed.

110
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,586
I could say I'm Captain America,
but it doesn't put wings on my head.

111
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,671
What did he want?

112
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:57,382
Same thing we do... expose Fisk.

113
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:01,469
I printed this from a
thumb drive he gave me.

114
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:04,806
Oh, my God!

115
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:08,476
Told me Fisk was behind the
bombings and shooting those cops...

116
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,061
said he owns half the police...

117
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:12,021
that they helped him
take down the Russians.

118
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:14,524
But I don't understand.
If you have all of this, then...

119
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:19,237
Hearsay. Can't print any of it
without corroboration, can you?

120
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:22,824
He could just be throwing smoke. I
mean, he just killed Detective Blake.

121
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:25,868
Said Blake's partner Hoffman did
it, probably on Fisk's orders.

122
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:27,954
But yeah, it occurred to me.

123
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:30,290
You could talk to Hoffman.

124
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:32,167
Tried. He's in the wind.

125
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,461
Or bottom of the river. Either way...

126
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:37,797
He just shrugged.

127
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,006
Sorry.

128
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,843
Wait, what about the Union Allied money?

129
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,471
Is there a way that we can
tie it directly to Fisk?

130
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:45,805
Maybe.

131
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:49,976
According to the Mask, a man named,
uh, Leland Owlsley runs the books.

132
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,769
But since getting roughed up by him,

133
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:54,272
Owlsley's been surrounded
by Fisk's security.

134
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:55,476
Can't get anywhere near him.

135
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:57,609
Same goes with, uh, James Wesley,

136
00:10:57,692 --> 00:11:00,945
the guy you said hired you to defend Healy.

137
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,406
Look, the Mask came to Ben for help.

138
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,035
And I don't care how rich Fisk is,
nobody can totally erase their past.

139
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,871
I mean, somewhere out there,

140
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:13,541
there has to be a piece
of paper, a witness...

141
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,752
the truth.

142
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:17,712
What about Confederated Global?

143
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,547
The suit that hired us to defend Healy

144
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:21,966
standing right next to Fisk
when he gave his big speech.

145
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,177
I looked into that.
According to FCC filings,

146
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:28,139
Confed Global's where Fisk gets
most of his reported income.

147
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:29,849
All right, let's play this out.

148
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:31,893
If Fisk is connected to Confed Global,

149
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:34,521
that means he's involved in
Westmeyer-Holt Contracting, which...

150
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:38,441
Westmeyer-Holt is strong-arming tenants
out of their rent-controlled apartments.

151
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,443
Um, they were hired by
a guy named Armand Tully.

152
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:41,528
The slumlord?

153
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:45,323
Landman and Zack say he's on vacation
on an island that no one can pronounce,

154
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:47,158
where they use coconuts as phones.

155
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,911
Another connection in the wind.

156
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:52,789
Westmeyer-Holt to Confed to Fisk.

157
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:54,552
We pull that thread, see what it unravels.

158
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,459
Still not sure about this mask guy.

159
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,545
He didn't hurt
Ben and he didn't hurt me.

160
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:01,339
I'll take the Devil of Hell's
Kitchen over Fisk any day.

161
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:03,550
Plus, he kicks ass.

162
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,678
No, you should've seen the way that
he was flipping around in the rain.

163
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:08,638
Well, if he's such a badass,
why did he come to Ben?

164
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:10,557
Why not just take Fisk down himself?

165
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:15,061
Maybe he knows there's some
roads you can't come back from.

166
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:25,780
Our latest polls show
your approval numbers rising...

167
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:28,950
across political, ethnic
and economic lines.

168
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:33,120
The 501 has been approved,

169
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:35,832
so the PAC is actively making donations,

170
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:39,669
and Senator Cherryh's
office has asked for a meet.

171
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:42,339
Breakfast.

172
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:45,883
Reject the first place they suggest.

173
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:52,807
How about Detective Hoffman?

174
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:57,186
Our sources in IAB tell me he was
supposed to give a follow-up statement

175
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,397
about what happened at Metro-General.

176
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:01,107
He never showed.

177
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:04,110
We need to put this behind us.

178
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:06,070
If he's still in the city, we'll find him.

179
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,238
If he isn't?

180
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:12,243
We'll still find him. It might
just take a little longer.

181
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:16,873
And the man in the mask?

182
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,877
The authorities are
motivated to shoot on sight...

183
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,003
if they have the opportunity.

184
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:25,465
He's not nearly as active
as he has been in the past.

185
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,342
Maybe he's given up.

186
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:32,304
Maybe he's just choosing
his targets more carefully.

187
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:36,768
Hey, I said you need to wait outside.

188
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:43,924
It's all right, Francis. Thank you.

189
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:48,237
My apologies, Nobu-san.

190
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:53,075
If I had known you were coming...

191
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:59,624
He doesn't
care for the accommodations.

192
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,252
Misspeak my words again...

193
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:04,712
and I will have your tongue.

194
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:06,756
Wesley is just trying to be polite.

195
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,510
The time for pleasantries... is at an end.

196
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:13,763
I was promised a city block

197
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:17,642
in return for my aid in your ventures.

198
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,189
There is a...

199
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:30,196
a tenement in, um...
this particular area...

200
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:35,410
it has proven troublesome to vacate.

201
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,455
But we have other blocks
coming up if you...

202
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:44,919
This one.

203
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,879
I don't recall...

204
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,633
guaranteeing a specific block.

205
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:55,262
You'll need to be patient...

206
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:57,389
or choose another.

207
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,020
I am bound by certain requirements.

208
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:06,441
Even I have those I must answer to.

209
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:10,987
After the setback at the docks...

210
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,948
I can afford no further disruptions.

211
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:17,243
Do what you must, but do it quickly.

212
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:19,245
Wesley?

213
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:24,626
Regardless of how carefully it's
handled, you're now the owner of record.

214
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,588
The negative publicity could prove costly.

215
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:32,133
My organization will
compensate you for the expense.

216
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:35,928
Well, the offer's
appreciated, but unnecessary.

217
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:38,640
There is, however, a problem

218
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:42,727
that you could aid me in
solving, in return for my help.

219
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:46,481
One that has inconvenienced us both.

220
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:49,484
The man in black.

221
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:54,572
He's proven to be more difficult
to address than expected.

222
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:01,120
Possessed of determination
and unusual talents.

223
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,044
We must match him in kind.

224
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:13,257
A specialist, perhaps,
from your organization.

225
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,635
I know of one with such skills.

226
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:19,514
But finding our enemy will be difficult.

227
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:22,308
He has become... cautious.

228
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,018
Yes, he has.

229
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:29,941
But emotion...

230
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:37,657
can turn the most
circumspect of men careless.

231
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:48,292
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- Well, it sure sounds like it.

232
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,546
Hey, if Fisk really is the guy
that blew the hell out of my city,

233
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:53,297
shot those cops and went after you,

234
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,008
then nobody wants to see him
take it on the nuts more than me.

235
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,343
No, I might have you edged out on that.

236
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:59,929
Okay, present company excluded.

237
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:03,307
All I'm saying is Armand
Tully is a dead end.

238
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,590
You find something out?

239
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:08,270
I, um, did a little
back-channeling with Marci.

240
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:10,397
Okay, ew, just... What did you get?

241
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:12,233
Tully really is on an island

242
00:17:12,316 --> 00:17:14,819
that he bought with the money
that Confed Global is paying him

243
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:17,071
for all his real estate
holdings in Hell's Kitchen.

244
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:18,239
Then, that's the link!

245
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:21,242
I mean, it ties Fisk directly to
what's happening in the tenement case.

246
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:22,577
No, it doesn't.

247
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,787
According to the records, the deal
just went through this morning.

248
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:25,955
So...

249
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:28,625
So everything that
happened with the case up till now

250
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,335
was before Fisk was the owner
on record. All falls on Tully.

251
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:35,339
Okay, so we go after Tully.
We get him to turn on Fisk.

252
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,508
Yeah, that island he's on?

253
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:39,551
No extradition agreement.

254
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:41,846
It's another dead end.

255
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,028
You just asked
her where the library is.

256
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:06,996
They doubled the offer
to get the tenants to move out.

257
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,583
Oh,
damn it. What?

258
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,628
Her neighbors are thinking about taking it.

259
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:14,879
Maybe they should.

260
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:16,964
No! Tell her to stand firm.

261
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:19,568
We told her we're gonna help her
and that's what we're gonna do.

262
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,518
Such a good boy.

263
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:41,781
She thinks
she can change their minds.

264
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,658
Enough of them maybe to make a difference.

265
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:47,078
I no take! This my home.

266
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:48,579
We fight, yes?

267
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:50,873
Yes, s.

268
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,459
He is good man.

269
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:55,627
All of you...

270
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:56,713
good.

271
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:05,512
You shouldn't have done that.

272
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:07,636
What? Fight for the rights
of the little guy, right?

273
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,768
Fisk wants the tenements, he's
not gonna stop until he gets them.

274
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:12,732
Well, so what? We're just
supposed to roll over?

275
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,355
Fisk is public on this.

276
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:15,773
If we tie him up with an injunction,

277
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:17,524
maybe we find something in
the deposition that we...

278
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:20,903
Oh, come on, Foggy, you think we're
gonna trip this guy up with a deposition?

279
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:23,405
After everything that's happened,
you don't get who we're dealing with?

280
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:24,490
No, we get it!

281
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:28,410
Matt, he's a rich dickhead who thinks
he can pay people off to kiss his ass.

282
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:34,458
Look, he is standing on City Hall
with his cronies like he's already won.

283
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,085
You know he can't see that.

284
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:37,837
All right, we can't let
him get away with this.

285
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,881
- I know.
- So, what are we gonna do?

286
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:45,970
Basic tenet of both
law and war, know your enemy.

287
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,639
Thank you, Sun Tzu. What
does that actually mean?

288
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:51,768
It means we keep digging.

289
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:53,728
Like Karen said, somewhere out there,

290
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:57,564
there's a piece of paper or a witness,
or something that'll lead to the truth.

291
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:59,358
Okay, good.

292
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:03,362
But, do it quietly. Stay under the radar.

293
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:06,407
Where are you going?

294
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,910
Three people stood with Fisk
when he addressed the city.

295
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:11,662
His man from Confed
Global, Owlsley and a woman.

296
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:13,705
One the press said he seemed close with.

297
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,625
Oh, yeah, uh, Vanessa, um...

298
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,420
Marianna. It says she works
at Scene Contempo Gallery.

299
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:22,173
Maybe it's time I invested in some art.

300
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:29,388
Here's the
list that I came up with.

301
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:30,472
Anyone else?

302
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,224
Make sure
Richmond's on the guest list.

303
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:35,937
He won't come, but he'll get
pissy if he isn't invited.

304
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:39,611
You have a visitor
coming in through the west entrance.

305
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,498
May I help you?

306
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,710
I hope so. Um, Matthew.

307
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:00,962
Vanessa.

308
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:02,880
Vanessa.

309
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:06,175
You're probably wondering what a man
who can't see is doing in an art gallery.

310
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:08,970
I didn't want to be forward.

311
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:13,474
I'm told by my guests my
apartment's a bit stark.

312
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:15,309
I thought maybe some art would warm it up.

313
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:20,564
I'm going to go out on a limb and
assume these "guests" were women?

314
00:21:22,774 --> 00:21:25,652
Well, I'm not trying to
impress the pizza guy.

315
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:28,655
Good. You don't need
sight to appreciate art,

316
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,491
but you do need honesty.

317
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:32,618
- Sight helps.
- Sure.

318
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:36,538
But there's something very intimate

319
00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:39,708
in experiencing art
through someone else's eyes.

320
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,837
That's a good line, by
the way. You should use it.

321
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,296
I might.

322
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,842
So, give me an idea what you're after.

323
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:49,426
I am not sure.

324
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:53,055
Good... art isn't furniture.

325
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:56,934
If you knew exactly what you were
looking for, you'd be just decorating.

326
00:21:57,018 --> 00:22:00,521
Art should speak to you... move you.

327
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,439
This one, for example.

328
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:06,318
One of my favorite pieces.

329
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:11,949
Describe it to me.

330
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:17,371
Imagine a sea of tonal reds.

331
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:21,333
The color of anger...

332
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,585
of rage...

333
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:26,213
but also the color of the heart...

334
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:29,716
of love... hope.

335
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,970
This strikes the perfect
balance between the two.

336
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,224
I don't know, it sounds aggressive.

337
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:40,602
All depends on your point of view.

338
00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:43,605
Maybe something a little less challenging.

339
00:22:44,648 --> 00:22:46,275
Tell me, do you have a man in your life?

340
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:50,487
Matthew, are you hitting on me?

341
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:52,781
No, I just
mean, what does he like?

342
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:54,116
What does he respond to?

343
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,327
If I can get inside the head of the man

344
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,412
who won the heart of such a charming woman,

345
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:00,497
it would inform my decision.

346
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:04,543
Well, you could always ask him yourself.

347
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:25,231
Hope I'm not
interrupting. I was nearby.

348
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,394
Not at all. We
were just talking about you.

349
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,526
I see.

350
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:33,572
Wilson Fisk, Matthew...

351
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:35,241
Murdock.

352
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:37,909
Oh, yes, the attorney.

353
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:40,204
I've heard about all your
work in Hell's Kitchen.

354
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,498
Ah.

355
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:44,416
I'm aware of yours as well.

356
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,087
Mr. Murdock is thinking
of purchasing some art.

357
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,258
He was looking for some
advice from a man of taste.

358
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,886
Well, that's simple. Buy
whatever the lady tells you.

359
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:58,805
Thank you.

360
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:00,474
Although we probably shouldn't be talking.

361
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:02,601
I believe we're on opposite
sides of a tenancy case.

362
00:24:02,684 --> 00:24:04,520
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

363
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:05,771
Hmm.

364
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:08,649
The rental properties I
recently acquired from Mr. Tully.

365
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,361
But I'm sure that will be
settled to everyone's benefit.

366
00:24:12,444 --> 00:24:15,781
The city has suffered long enough
under the burden of poverty and decay.

367
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,535
I believe we have opportunities now with...

368
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:23,747
Wilson, Mr. Murdock is
a customer, not a donor.

369
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:27,709
Yes, I apologize for the hard sell.

370
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,838
This city and its future...

371
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:35,926
Seeing Hell's Kitchen to its fullest
potential is very important to me.

372
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:39,263
I feel the same way.

373
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,142
Vanessa, thank you so much for your time.

374
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:47,854
Have you changed your mind
about what you came for?

375
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:50,899
No, no, I would just
need to consider the cost.

376
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:53,152
Mr. Fisk.

377
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:31,482
I like to have a
moment... end of the day...

378
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:34,526
just me and him.

379
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:40,116
Maybe you could put in a word.

380
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:44,703
How did you know I was sitting
here, you mind me asking?

381
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:47,498
You want the short answer or the long one?

382
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:55,381
I was worried you might've gone
out and done something foolish,

383
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:57,090
after our talk this morning.

384
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:59,385
I haven't done anything.

385
00:26:01,137 --> 00:26:02,638
Not yet.

386
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:05,599
Sounds a bit on the ominous side.

387
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:10,271
I went to visit someone close to the...

388
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,106
close to the Devil.

389
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:17,528
Not to hurt her,
just to get a sense of him.

390
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:21,698
Of who he is and what it would take to...

391
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,035
do what I have to.

392
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:26,703
And...

393
00:26:28,497 --> 00:26:30,123
what did you learn?

394
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:35,796
That he has someone he loves...

395
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:39,466
who loves him, who'd mourn his loss.

396
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,051
Mmm-hmm.

397
00:26:42,178 --> 00:26:44,555
Few things are absolute, Matthew.

398
00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:47,974
Even Lucifer was once an angel.

399
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:51,853
It's why judgment and vengeance...

400
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:54,606
are best left to God.

401
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:57,984
Especially when murder
is not in your heart.

402
00:26:58,068 --> 00:26:59,945
How do you know?

403
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:02,406
You're here, aren't you?

404
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:07,160
Foggy, Foggy, Foggy...

405
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:08,329
Sorry.

406
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:09,996
Foggy, Foggy...

407
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:21,717
I know my soul is damned
if I take his life.

408
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:26,012
But if I stand idle, if I...

409
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:30,517
If I let him consume this city, all
the people that will suffer and die...

410
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:34,521
There is a wide gulf between
inaction and murder, Matthew.

411
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:38,024
Another man's evil does not make you good.

412
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:41,194
Men have used the atrocities of
their enemies to justify their own

413
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:43,071
throughout history.

414
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:46,992
So the question you have
to ask yourself is...

415
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:52,289
are you struggling with the fact
that you don't wanna kill this man...

416
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,375
but have to?

417
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:57,210
Or that you don't have to kill him...

418
00:27:58,587 --> 00:28:00,213
but want to?

419
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:05,719
"Like a muddied spring
or a polluted fountain

420
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:09,348
is the righteous man who
gives way before the wicked."

421
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:12,643
Proverbs 25-something,
I never can remember.

422
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:15,061
Meaning righteous men have
a duty to stand up to evil.

423
00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:17,564
One interpretation.

424
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:22,778
Another is that when the righteous
succumb to sin, it is as harmful

425
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:25,822
as if the public well were poisoned.

426
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:31,745
Because the darkness of such
an act... of taking a life...

427
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:37,042
will spread to friends, neighbors...

428
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:40,629
the entire community.

429
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:46,051
What if it already has?

430
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:48,262
Then we wouldn't be sitting here, would we?

431
00:28:52,724 --> 00:28:58,397
I don't believe you went to see this
woman for insight into how to kill a man.

432
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:01,567
I think...

433
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:06,488
maybe you went looking for a reason not to.

434
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,543
Hey!

435
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:21,545
Hey.

436
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:25,048
Uh, Foggy, um, tried to get
a hold of you last night.

437
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,175
Oh, yeah, turned off my phone.

438
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:30,846
You okay?

439
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:34,600
Yeah, just... tired.

440
00:29:34,683 --> 00:29:38,687
How did it go with that,
um... Vanessa woman?

441
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,481
Oh, I didn't get what I needed.

442
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:42,899
Oh.

443
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:44,818
Well, uh, Foggy and I had better luck.

444
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:49,155
Um, we identified the assholes
that jumped us outside of Elena's.

445
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,408
It's a Stewart Schmidt and Joseph Pike.

446
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:54,077
- You ID'd them from booking photos?
- No, actually...

447
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,037
Contractor's licenses.

448
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:58,624
- And where the hell were you?
- Uh...

449
00:29:58,707 --> 00:30:00,208
Walking, clearing my head.

450
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,503
Hate when you don't answer my calls, buddy.

451
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:04,671
I always think you fell down
an open manhole or something.

452
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:06,840
I'm fine. Who's
the employer of record?

453
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:08,467
Westmeyer-Holt Contracting,

454
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,261
another wonderful Global Confed subsidiary.

455
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,554
Well, that's it. That's great.

456
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:16,057
We press assault charges,
get them to flip on Fisk.

457
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:17,267
Yeah, not so much.

458
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:20,311
I reached out to Ben and his
sources say that they're off the map.

459
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:22,606
Just like Hoffman and Tully.

460
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:23,899
Of course they are.

461
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:26,777
Great, so we have nothing.

462
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,406
I wouldn't go that far. Here,
Foggy, show him the thing.

463
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:32,658
Right, the thing!

464
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:33,825
What thing?

465
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:35,661
The dream, buddy.

466
00:30:39,164 --> 00:30:41,166
It's just like the one I drew on the napkin

467
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:44,127
that you, uh, couldn't see back when.

468
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,546
Oh.

469
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:48,715
It's a little small, isn't it?

470
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,966
Building regulations.

471
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,178
Anyway, so are we. We
are small but awesome.

472
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:54,930
And we're gonna make a difference.

473
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:56,932
I know it doesn't feel like it sometimes...

474
00:30:57,015 --> 00:31:00,226
a lot of the time, but we
are, with the power of the law.

475
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,103
Okay.

476
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:04,856
Dragged me into this
rinky-dink firm, Murdock...

477
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:07,692
and I'll never be able to
thank you enough for it.

478
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,071
You're not gonna kiss me.

479
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:12,656
- I'm feeling a little somethin'.
- Oh...

480
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,579
Okay, come here.

481
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:18,161
Nelson and Murdock, how may I help you?

482
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:19,830
Time for those handyman skills.

483
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:20,997
Uh, hey!

484
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:24,334
Sorry, what?

485
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:28,714
Um...

486
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:32,133
Uh, when?

487
00:31:42,352 --> 00:31:44,020
It's her.

488
00:31:47,941 --> 00:31:49,610
How did it happen?

489
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:53,822
Neighbor saw some junkie
they've seen in the building,

490
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:56,366
fleeing the scene with her purse.

491
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,952
Probably jumped her while
she was fishing for her keys.

492
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:03,874
Karen, maybe you should wait outside.

493
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:05,959
No. No, I'm...

494
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:12,173
How did she die?

495
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:16,637
Multiple stab wounds.

496
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:20,431
The ambulance got there quick, but...

497
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:27,063
My mom says all the family
she knew about's passed on.

498
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:29,399
I knew you were looking
into her tenancy case.

499
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:33,529
I thought you might be able to
point us toward the next of kin.

500
00:32:33,612 --> 00:32:35,030
No, she didn't have anyone.

501
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:37,908
Just us.

502
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:40,994
We'll see to the arrangements.

503
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:44,748
It's good of you to take that on.

504
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:47,876
I'll let the ME know.

505
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,320
Ahhh!

506
00:33:35,506 --> 00:33:38,134
You are a worthy opponent.

507
00:33:39,344 --> 00:33:42,472
It is an honor to claim your life.

508
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,118
Ahhh!

509
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:27,392
Thanks.

510
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,227
I'll keep 'em comin', love.

511
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:40,864
When we first took the case, Karen
and I went to Landman and Zack.

512
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:44,242
Marci talked about a "criminal
element" in Elena's building.

513
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:48,079
Said that's why the workmen left
without finishing the repairs.

514
00:34:49,122 --> 00:34:50,999
"'Cause they feared for their safety."

515
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,585
I thought it was bullshit.

516
00:34:56,337 --> 00:34:57,338
Maybe it was.

517
00:34:57,422 --> 00:34:59,257
Tell that to Elena.

518
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:01,927
Wait, what are you saying?

519
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,888
Well, I don't know.

520
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,099
Just doesn't feel right, does it?

521
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:09,893
I'll drink to that.

522
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:11,687
You think it was a coincidence?

523
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,566
Elena decides to stay and fight,

524
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,361
to rally what's left of her
neighbors, and this happens.

525
00:35:20,445 --> 00:35:24,240
Do you think Fisk had
something to do with this?

526
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:26,702
Speak of the devil.

527
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,040
Fisk is on the TV again.

528
00:35:32,123 --> 00:35:34,125
Hey, Josie, could you turn that up?

529
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:38,839
No, I never had the pleasure
of meeting Ms. Cardenas.

530
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,883
I only recently took
possession of her building.

531
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:46,972
How do you respond to reports that
you knew the tenement was unsafe?

532
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:48,264
That is accurate.

533
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:52,018
That's why we offered a substantial
sum to Ms. Cardenas and her neighbors

534
00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:53,603
to help them relocate.

535
00:35:55,646 --> 00:35:58,086
We should never let good people
get swallowed up by this city.

536
00:35:59,943 --> 00:36:02,028
I mourn this woman's death.

537
00:36:03,321 --> 00:36:04,841
Didn't have to happen. It should've...

538
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:11,037
Her passing is a symptom
of a larger disease...

539
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:12,881
infecting all of us.

540
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,665
Disease of fear...

541
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,917
Funeral home.

542
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:18,503
...fear of bombings,
fear of cop killings.

543
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:20,005
Hello?

544
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:22,008
- Fear of a masked psychopath.
- Yeah, that's me.

545
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:23,216
Yeah, I need to make arrangements.

546
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:26,511
We shouldn't let people
like that take our city from us.

547
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:29,222
We need to stand together.

548
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:31,266
Let them know that they will fail...

549
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,435
because we believe we
can make a difference.

550
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:38,732
'Cause they are cowards!

551
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:42,527
Afraid of stepping out of the shadows.

552
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,156
Afraid of standing up for
people like Mrs. Cardenas.

553
00:36:47,615 --> 00:36:49,951
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

554
00:36:50,035 --> 00:36:51,452
Mr. Fisk, how does this
affect the upcoming benefit?

555
00:36:51,536 --> 00:36:52,537
That will be all. Thank you.

556
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,940
- Mr. Fisk...
- No more questions.

557
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:56,666
- Thank you very much.
- What can we do about this psycho...

558
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:01,087
Jesus, he almost sounds like he means it.

559
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,298
I think he does.

560
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:05,842
And he's calling the
man in the mask a psycho?

561
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:08,553
I hope they trace what happened
to Elena right to his doorstep.

562
00:37:08,636 --> 00:37:10,471
He'd never expose himself like that.

563
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,975
Plus, half the force is
probably in his pocket.

564
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:19,272
Well, then, let's pray the
Mask gets his hands on him.

565
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:22,608
Knocks his goddamn head off.

566
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:29,449
You religious, Karen?

567
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:32,077
My parents were.

568
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:35,663
That's probably why I'm not.

569
00:37:37,498 --> 00:37:38,583
You?

570
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:41,962
Catholic.

571
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:47,467
Does it help?

572
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,804
With things like this?

573
00:37:52,388 --> 00:37:53,849
Not today.

574
00:37:57,978 --> 00:37:59,645
I think I've had enough.

575
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:05,485
- Tell Foggy I'll see him in the morning.
- Yeah.

576
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:11,074
Hey, Matt.

577
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:12,283
Yeah?

578
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:17,413
If there is a God...

579
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,834
and if he cares at all about...

580
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:23,044
about any of us...

581
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:27,632
Fisk will get what he deserves.

582
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:30,676
You have to believe that.

583
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:33,304
I do.

584
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,753
Look at it.

585
00:40:31,422 --> 00:40:33,633
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

586
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:35,093
Tell me what you do know.

587
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:37,803
All right, all right,
I'll tell you anything you want.

588
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:39,889
Just, please, stop hurting me!

589
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,882
Hey, you're real, you're... You're real...

590
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:00,595
- Where'd you get the purse?
- What purse?

591
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:09,187
Lying? Bad idea.

592
00:42:11,064 --> 00:42:12,732
Please, stop! I'm... I'm sick.

593
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:17,153
Okay! Okay, the purse! I'll
tell you who snatched it...

594
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:24,702
Listen, I've hurt a lot of people
tonight to get what I need to know.

595
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:27,872
The asshole that killed Mrs.
Cardenas shoots up at this address,

596
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:29,039
likes cheap menthols.

597
00:42:29,124 --> 00:42:32,668
Thinks it covers the stench of
his rotting teeth. It doesn't.

598
00:42:35,296 --> 00:42:36,631
Who paid you?

599
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:39,008
- No, I don't, I don't...
- Was it Fisk?

600
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:41,386
Was it Fisk?

601
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:44,639
Was it Wilson Fisk?

602
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:47,475
No, I don't know! Please, stop! Please!

603
00:42:47,558 --> 00:42:48,559
Give me a reason to!

604
00:42:48,643 --> 00:42:52,062
I don't know their names.
I don't! They found me.

605
00:42:52,147 --> 00:42:54,274
They took me to a warehouse on the water...

606
00:42:54,357 --> 00:42:55,900
Pier 81.

607
00:42:55,983 --> 00:42:57,568
I didn't wanna do it, man.

608
00:42:57,652 --> 00:42:59,987
I swear. I didn't wanna do it!

609
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,158
But I was hurting. I was hurting, man.

610
00:43:04,117 --> 00:43:05,826
Shut up!

611
00:43:09,664 --> 00:43:10,944
You're gonna turn yourself in...

612
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:15,545
to Sergeant Brett Mahoney
at the 15th Precinct.

613
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:19,882
If you don't, I'll find you. And
next time, I'm not gonna stop.

614
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:19,024
I didn't come here for you.

615
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:24,154
But I am the one you have found.

616
00:44:38,168 --> 00:44:41,339
You were at the docks with the boy.

617
00:44:41,422 --> 00:44:43,966
As were you...

618
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,718
with the old fool.

619
00:44:47,303 --> 00:44:49,514
That was unexpected.

620
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,766
I'm not part of his war.

621
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:54,602
Yet you aided him.

622
00:44:55,686 --> 00:44:59,315
And in the act, caused me displeasure.

623
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:03,819
Did Fisk send you?

624
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,282
Is that why he paid that junkie to...

625
00:45:10,368 --> 00:45:15,373
A woman is dead, and for what? Just
to lure me into some kind of a trap?

626
00:45:15,456 --> 00:45:19,544
You are here, are you not?

627
00:45:19,627 --> 00:45:21,921
I knew no
one was in the building.

628
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:26,133
Made that mistake with the
Russians once. Learned from it.

629
00:45:26,216 --> 00:45:29,219
But you did not know I was here.

630
00:45:30,513 --> 00:45:31,972
No...

631
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:34,934
you slowed your heart...

632
00:45:36,936 --> 00:45:39,229
lowered your body temperature.

633
00:45:39,314 --> 00:45:41,649
The old fool has
taught you in our ways.

634
00:45:41,732 --> 00:45:43,372
I told you I'm not with him.

635
00:45:43,401 --> 00:45:45,486
Yet you're still a warrior...

636
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:49,449
deserving of a warrior's death.

637
00:45:49,532 --> 00:45:51,867
I came here for Fisk.

638
00:45:53,243 --> 00:45:54,954
Guess I'll have to settle for you.

639
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,336
I show you respect.

640
00:46:02,753 --> 00:46:05,715
You would be wise to return the courtesy.

641
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:08,968
You'll have to earn it.

642
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,629
Shit, sorry.

643
00:46:47,006 --> 00:46:48,566
Hey, can I get
another bottle over here?

644
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:51,719
No, no, never mind, Josie. Hey, hey, Foggy.

645
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:55,014
Foggy, I've had enough, and
you have had...

646
00:46:55,097 --> 00:46:56,599
Way, way past that.

647
00:46:56,682 --> 00:46:58,100
It's a wake, Karen.

648
00:46:59,435 --> 00:47:01,020
People drink at wakes.

649
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:02,187
You don't need it.

650
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:03,606
You know why?

651
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:05,858
'Cause it sucks.

652
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:07,402
I know.

653
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,862
You speak Spanish.

654
00:47:11,363 --> 00:47:14,033
What's a good toast for
the people that should...

655
00:47:14,116 --> 00:47:15,826
- That should still...
- Hey.

656
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:18,120
Hey, hey, hey.

657
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:20,456
I should have told her
to take the money like Matt said.

658
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,417
No, no, no, no, Foggy...

659
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,003
it's not your fault, okay?

660
00:47:32,968 --> 00:47:35,596
The Hell's Kitchen I grew
up in was a real shithole.

661
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,222
But it had a heart, you know?

662
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:39,266
Yeah.

663
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:42,562
Me and Matt... we learned the law...

664
00:47:42,645 --> 00:47:44,439
how to play by the rules.

665
00:47:45,815 --> 00:47:48,443
We were gonna help the
people that we grew up with.

666
00:47:48,526 --> 00:47:51,236
Give 'em the same shot
as the big boys like Fisk.

667
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:54,615
It's all bullshit.

668
00:47:55,825 --> 00:47:56,909
It's all just...

669
00:47:56,992 --> 00:47:59,787
lies that we tell ourselves to
make it through one more day.

670
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,748
No, I don't... I don't believe that.

671
00:48:02,832 --> 00:48:04,500
I can't.

672
00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:09,088
What are we supposed to do...

673
00:48:09,171 --> 00:48:13,968
against somebody that owns everything?

674
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:15,344
Everyone?

675
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:20,808
What can we do to somebody like that?

676
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:23,811
The only thing you can...

677
00:48:26,438 --> 00:48:28,440
you make them pay.

678
00:48:55,593 --> 00:48:57,595
You have fought well.

679
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:02,266
It is... not enough.

680
00:49:31,128 --> 00:49:32,462
Thank you.

681
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:36,175
Nobu was becoming an issue.

682
00:49:38,052 --> 00:49:41,889
I appreciate you...
removing him from concern.

683
00:49:43,432 --> 00:49:46,268
You... wanted me to do this.

684
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:50,565
In a perfect world, you would
have taken each other out, but...

685
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:54,735
it isn't a perfect world, is it?

686
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:56,070
Not yet.

687
00:49:57,487 --> 00:50:01,200
To be honest... it took
longer than I expected.

688
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:05,120
Nobu didn't mind. He meditated for hours.

689
00:50:05,204 --> 00:50:07,582
I find it difficult to meditate.

690
00:50:07,665 --> 00:50:10,292
My mind, it won't quiet.

691
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,046
It's a
character flaw, I suppose.

692
00:50:15,923 --> 00:50:17,549
We all have them.

693
00:50:19,259 --> 00:50:20,510
You, for instance.

694
00:50:21,345 --> 00:50:25,933
You've demonstrated an emotional
weakness for children and women.

695
00:50:26,016 --> 00:50:28,811
I assumed that would extend to the elderly.

696
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:31,939
So I baited the hook.

697
00:50:33,649 --> 00:50:35,234
Here you are.

698
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:37,862
You took her life...

699
00:50:39,363 --> 00:50:42,116
just to get my attention?

700
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:44,660
Nobu forced my hand in the matter.

701
00:50:46,078 --> 00:50:49,707
My options, they were limited by necessity.

702
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:53,085
I took no pleasure in her passing.

703
00:50:54,128 --> 00:50:57,339
I'm... gonna kill you.

704
00:51:03,595 --> 00:51:05,347
Take your shot.

705
00:52:11,831 --> 00:52:13,833
It's disappointing.

706
00:52:18,628 --> 00:52:20,380
Wesley.

707
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:58,836
Put men on the dock.

708
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:01,756
If they see the Mask, put a bullet in him.

709
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,594
What about Nobu?

710
00:53:10,806 --> 00:53:12,641
Let him burn.

711
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:21,441
Matt!

712
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:22,818
Come on, Matt.

713
00:53:22,902 --> 00:53:25,237
I need to talk to you, Matt.

714
00:53:29,825 --> 00:53:31,869
We need to keep going, Matt.

715
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:36,206
We gotta nail that bastard to the wall.

716
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,209
We gotta make him pay... for Elena...

717
00:53:40,878 --> 00:53:42,504
for everything.

718
00:53:45,007 --> 00:53:46,008
Matt?

719
00:53:46,091 --> 00:53:49,511
Are you okay in there? Matt?

720
00:53:51,847 --> 00:53:52,973
Matt!

721
00:53:58,854 --> 00:53:59,980
Matt?

722
00:54:05,277 --> 00:54:07,071
It's me.

723
00:54:07,154 --> 00:54:08,655
I heard a crash.

724
00:54:10,324 --> 00:54:13,577
Not the fun, sexy-time kind, but...

725
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:16,914
more of the...

726
00:54:16,997 --> 00:54:19,249
I've-fallen-and-I-can't-get-up
variety.

727
00:54:22,837 --> 00:54:23,963
Matt?

728
00:54:40,855 --> 00:54:42,857
If anyone who's
in here is not supposed to be,

729
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,317
I will mess you up. I'm not kidding.

730
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:58,080
Where's Matt? What'd you do to him?

731
00:55:12,094 --> 00:55:13,220
Shit.

732
00:55:54,136 --> 00:55:55,637
Matt?

733
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:04,106
