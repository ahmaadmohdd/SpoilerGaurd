1
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:17,001
Don't you move!

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,880
Don't you freakin' move!

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,717
Interlock your
fingers behind your head...

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,302
and get on your knees.

5
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:29,388
On your knees! Do it! Do it now!

6
00:00:30,056 --> 00:00:33,101
Don't you move. I'll put a bullet in you!

7
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:36,980
Last chance, asshole!
I will not hesitate to put you down!

8
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:38,522
On your knees, do it!

9
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,690
Keep your eyes on him.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,735
All
right. Nice and slow.

11
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,407
- You got him?
- Yeah, yeah.

12
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:49,825
Cuff the son of a bitch.

13
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,293
What about this asshole?

14
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:01,754
Take care of him like we
were told. No witnesses.

15
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,348
Ahhh!

16
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,028
How bad are you hurt?

17
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:12,491
Central! 15 Eddie!
Shots fired! Shots fired!

18
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:14,577
Two suspects on foot!

19
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,813
- What's going on?
- All right, listen up, everybody!

20
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:09,692
We have reports coming in of multiple
explosions all across Hell's Kitchen.

21
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:12,861
- Hey, Henricks, call PD, get a statement.
- Yeah.

22
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:15,364
Taylor, reach out to
your guy at public works

23
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:17,158
and see if gas or methane
had anything to do with this.

24
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:18,576
What are the locations?

25
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:19,952
You see me talking here, Urich?

26
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:23,372
I'm just saying, it'd help if we knew
where we were going to cover this.

27
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:25,333
Caldwell, give me that list. Where are you?

28
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,917
Please. Come on, come on.

29
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,838
All right, locations are as follows,

30
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:37,761
44th and 11th, 48th and 9th,
47th and 12th, 42nd and 10th.

31
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,389
- It's not gas.
- How do you know that?

32
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:42,553
Places that were hit, all
controlled by the Russians.

33
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,643
Ben! Ben!

34
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,205
Yes.

35
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:06,915
Yes, it is.

36
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,085
I'll let him know.

37
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,173
- Vladimir is in the wind.
- How?

38
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:18,844
Our friend in the black
mask, he was beating on him,

39
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:22,014
but stopped Officer Corbin and
his boys from finishing him off.

40
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:24,016
Then he wasn't trying to kill Vladimir.

41
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:27,520
Based on what we know, probably
trying to get him to talk...

42
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:29,605
about you.

43
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:32,358
Blake was clumsy, letting
the mask get his phone.

44
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,777
I had just texted him the
addresses for the sweep.

45
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,070
We'll deal with Blake later.

46
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,199
We need to contain this.

47
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:44,244
Vladimir and the mask won't
make it out of the area.

48
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:45,538
The sweep will pick them up.

49
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:49,082
Gao put her trust in me.

50
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,169
She gave me her help.

51
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:58,342
She's going to be disappointed the
situation hasn't... concluded...

52
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,595
as neatly as promised.

53
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:02,888
What are you gonna tell her?

54
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:06,266
The truth. Lying to
that woman is impossible.

55
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,644
She'll want to know what our next move is.

56
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,271
Letting the police do their jobs.

57
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:16,109
That's what I pay them for, isn't it?

58
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:18,195
There's scumbags in the corridor.

59
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,822
We got two more over there.

60
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,992
You go check on them, okay?

61
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:25,077
- Every one.
- Yeah.

62
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,541
We got something here.

63
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,890
- He don't look so bad.
- Yeah, all things considered.

64
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:57,150
Swear to God, that asshole
knew I was a righty.

65
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,408
Oh, that hurts?

66
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:05,826
English!

67
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,035
Where's Vladimir?

68
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,787
I don't know!

69
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:14,460
Where would he go, huh, if
he didn't want to be found?

70
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:17,505
- He's got a girl somewhere maybe?
- I don't know.

71
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,258
I don't know!

72
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,636
I swear! I swear, please, please...

73
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:25,513
Stop!

74
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,349
Yeah, yeah, all right.

75
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:39,527
You find anyone alive,
shoot 'em in the head.

76
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,236
- Got it.
- Roger that.

77
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,363
Don't move.

78
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,282
You've been shot.

79
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:32,788
That sounds pretty bad,
but I don't speak asshole.

80
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:36,959
I'm going to kill you for
taking my brother's head.

81
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,753
You got the wrong guy. I don't kill people.

82
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:42,005
Not even scumbags like you who deserve it.

83
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,926
You dropped Semyon off roof.

84
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:47,928
Put him in coma.

85
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:51,056
Yeah... but he was still
breathing, wasn't he?

86
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,307
Your mask.

87
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:57,730
I found it... and what
was left of my brother.

88
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:59,356
- I didn't kill your brother.
- Lie!

89
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,900
You think I'm the one that blew
your operation to shit, too?

90
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:04,778
You're being played... by Fisk.

91
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:07,781
The man you work for.

92
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:10,325
Look, I don't know what you've been
told, but it's more of Fisk's games.

93
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,077
He's trying to put you
in the ground. I'm not.

94
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,328
Choose a side.

95
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,665
I choose my own.

96
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:18,291
Not an option.

97
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,085
Fisk made sure of that.

98
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,255
What do you want?

99
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,048
Fisk...

100
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:27,635
on trial for everything he's done.

101
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:33,724
Then you're a fool.

102
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,144
Yeah.

103
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:41,857
And you're bleeding out, so... here we are.

104
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,027
And if I believe you...

105
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,406
and give you what you want to know...

106
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:52,993
what do I get out of it?

107
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,163
Payback.

108
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,207
I have counterproposal.

109
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,006
Suck my dick.

110
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:12,387
Vladimir...

111
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,681
Vladimir...

112
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:18,268
Though no one's made official statements
about the nature of the explosions,

113
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,814
the NYPD is urging everyone to stay inside

114
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:24,149
until authorities are
clear on the nature of...

115
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:25,901
We need help!

116
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:27,736
Hey! Hey!

117
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,020
I got an elderly woman over
here and she's bleeding bad!

118
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,552
- Where's she hurt?
- Are you a nurse?

119
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:32,616
Yeah.

120
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,660
Pretty bad laceration.

121
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,956
- What's her name?
- Mrs. Cardenas. Elena.

122
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:46,880
We'll wait here for you, Mrs. C!

123
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,135
She's gonna... She's gonna be fine.

124
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,346
- I'm just glad we were with her.
- Yeah.

125
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:55,848
Early reports from the city...

126
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,226
Jesus, look at this.
It's like a war zone out there.

127
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:01,822
We better call Matt
and make sure he's okay.

128
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:02,896
Yeah.

129
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,565
Foggy, you're bleeding.

130
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:05,774
Huh?

131
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,443
Oh, that explains it.

132
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,779
- Explains what?
- The stabbing pain in my side.

133
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:11,947
Foggy!

134
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,116
Sit.

135
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,411
Here, just stay here. I'm gonna
go and try to find somebody, okay?

136
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:21,206
- I'll just, uh... yeah.
- Shit, what happened?

137
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,837
Let's get these people triaged and
coded, and get Central on the line.

138
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,674
We need to reroute incoming
casualties to Mercy or St. Mary's.

139
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,094
What are you doing here?

140
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:37,222
I heard you were in a car accident.
And since when do you drive?

141
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:40,726
- I made a very bad decision.
- That's my whole life.

142
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,227
Good to have you back.

143
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,980
Anybody see Shapiro? Shapiro?

144
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:51,611
Please tell me all this isn't
you dealing with the Russians.

145
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,949
Wasn't me, but I don't think you
have to worry about them anymore.

146
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,617
You call just to tell me that?

147
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,619
No, I need your help.

148
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:01,538
I found someone who has intel
on what I've been looking for,

149
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,790
but he's been shot.

150
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:04,833
So call 911.

151
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:07,878
Can't. Police are the ones that shot him.

152
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,255
Thinking they'd like a
crack at finishing the job.

153
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:13,842
You want me to come
out to you... in all this?

154
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:16,344
No, I want you to walk me
through stabilizing him.

155
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:21,266
It's not as easy as it looks
in the movies, you know?

156
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:22,768
I don't really go to the movies.

157
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:25,938
I like records, though.

158
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,647
All right.

159
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,692
There's something else you need to know.

160
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:32,319
The man I'm trying to save...

161
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:33,486
it's Vladimir.

162
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,406
The shithead that had me beat up?

163
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,866
That's who you want me to help?

164
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,659
Look, you have every right
to tell me to go to hell,

165
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:40,869
but he's important, Claire.

166
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:42,353
What he knows could bring Fisk down

167
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,250
and save more people like
you from getting hurt.

168
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:51,964
Claire?

169
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,592
- Is there an exit wound?
- Thank you.

170
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:58,011
Uh, no.

171
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,098
The bullet's still inside him.

172
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,600
It's still half a degree hotter
than the surrounding tissue.

173
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,560
Is there any kind of first aid kit?

174
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:07,855
I'm in a warehouse. Abandoned.

175
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:11,483
Tell me what's there, anything you can use.

176
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,693
All right, hang on.

177
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:20,617
Uh, half a box of nails... broken glass...

178
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,580
uh, wood, duct tape, old
roadside emergency kit,

179
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:28,751
- lot of plastic sheeting...
- The kit, are there any flares in it?

180
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,168
Yeah, two.

181
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:36,299
All right... you're
gonna cauterize the wound.

182
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,863
Shouldn't I dig the bullet out first?

183
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,845
Remember what I said about
this not being a movie?

184
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:42,305
You cut him open and start
digging around, you'll kill him.

185
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,142
This way at least he has a
chance of not bleeding out

186
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,519
before you get what you
need out of him and...

187
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:49,897
it'll hurt like a son of a bitch, so bonus.

188
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,606
All right, how do I do this?

189
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:57,279
Just light the flare, hold it close to
his skin until the entry wound seals.

190
00:13:57,362 --> 00:13:59,865
Okay, I'm gonna put you on speaker.

191
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,543
All right, I got it.

192
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:14,254
Don't let up... no matter
how much he screams.

193
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:16,464
Professional advice or personal?

194
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:18,383
Little of both.

195
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,928
All right, cauterizing the wound.

196
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:51,624
Did it stop the bleeding?

197
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,394
- Thanks, Claire. I gotta go.
- Matt?

198
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:14,314
Central, Post 41. Pick up of a 10-10.

199
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:18,443
Northwest corner of 4-7 and 12.
Abandoned building. Gimme an 85.

200
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:21,654
10-4, Post
41. Additional en route.

201
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:06,533
Show me your hands!

202
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,496
Show me your hands, now!

203
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,292
He can't hear you.

204
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,632
I'm gonna take my knee off your throat.

205
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,010
Stay quiet, answer my questions,

206
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:28,055
or your night's gonna
get a hell of a lot worse.

207
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:29,431
Understand?

208
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,939
Who do you work for?

209
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,732
The City of New York.

210
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:43,070
I'm gonna ask you again.
Think about your answer.

211
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,908
Who do you work for?

212
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:51,078
The City of New York. I
got two months on the job.

213
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:04,299
Call Central.

214
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,469
Tell them it was a false
alarm. No need to send backup.

215
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:11,514
I do that... you let me walk?

216
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,641
Eventually.

217
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:23,818
Central, Post 41 K.

218
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:25,653
10-4, Post 41.

219
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,201
Second floor! Perp in
mask! Wounded civilian...

220
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:34,246
10-4,
Post 41. 10-13, 10-13.

221
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:37,290
Abandoned building, 47th
and 12th, second floor.

222
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:40,293
- Roger that. Adam responding.
- Fifteenth Squad en route.

223
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:08,113
Where's Sullivan? Anybody got eyes?

224
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:09,531
Take it down, Pinski.

225
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:11,824
Me and Hoffman are HNT on this.

226
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,868
Secure the perimeter and
try not to piss yourself.

227
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,372
We gotta do this right.
This is a hostage job.

228
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:20,375
Nobody goes in and nobody comes out.

229
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,543
Let's go. Move.

230
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,174
You think he's in there?

231
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:29,676
Sullivan told Central
it was a "masked perp."

232
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,512
Russian was with the dickhead
last we heard, so yeah,

233
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:33,930
I'm thinking he's the wounded civvie.

234
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:36,683
- All right, I'll make the call.
- Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.

235
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,101
- Christ.
- Where do you think you're going?

236
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,686
Let's see some ID.

237
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:42,147
All right, all right. Go ahead.

238
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,690
Detectives!

239
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:45,983
Thought IAB'd have you riding a desk,

240
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,819
after that thing with the
Russians at the station.

241
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:50,447
You see what's going on here?
Nobody's riding a desk tonight.

242
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,074
- Can I get a statement?
- Yeah.

243
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:54,576
The world's a shitty
place. You can quote me.

244
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:56,161
Where's ESU?

245
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:58,663
Had their hands full with
that building that went up.

246
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:00,832
Carl, don't talk to him.
What's the matter with you?

247
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:02,709
What about the cop in there?

248
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,420
Officer, uh... Sullivan?

249
00:19:05,503 --> 00:19:06,921
How the hell you know that?

250
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,881
How long I been doing this?

251
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:10,405
Long enough to be a pain in the ass.

252
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:12,802
Just doing my job.

253
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,972
And we're doing ours... so
stay back and out of the way.

254
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:19,434
You know, this thing goes sideways, I
can't promise you don't get caught up.

255
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,062
Thanks.

256
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:24,356
I'll keep my head down.

257
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:26,108
Yeah, you do that.

258
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,448
I'll let him know. Wait for instruction.

259
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,083
The man in the mask has turned up.

260
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,170
Assaulting a cop in an
abandoned building on 12th.

261
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,463
One of ours?

262
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:51,674
No, some kid fresh out of the academy.

263
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:55,052
- What about Vladimir?
- Holed up with the mask.

264
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:58,348
Blake and Hoffman have
assumed HNT on scene,

265
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,766
secured the perimeter,

266
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,934
waiting for the go-ahead
to take the building.

267
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:03,270
Give it.

268
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:07,064
I wanna get this behind us.

269
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:09,234
There's a complication.

270
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:12,028
A reporter from the Bulletin.

271
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:13,571
Turn his head.

272
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:17,575
It's Ben Urich.

273
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:21,413
The Union Allied article.

274
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:24,999
If he picks up on anything
doesn't smell right...

275
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:26,501
it could be a problem.

276
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:32,799
Problems are just opportunities
that haven't presented themselves.

277
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:38,180
You reach out to all of
our contacts in the media.

278
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:44,561
I want everyone in Hell's Kitchen
to see what's about to happen.

279
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:03,830
You've been busy.

280
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:06,708
The building's surrounded.

281
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,086
Ten officers... four dogs.

282
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,879
More coming.

283
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:14,966
- How do you know this?
- Lucky guess.

284
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:23,015
- We could have used that.
- I'm not big on guns.

285
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:28,355
Great. Little stick, much better.

286
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,776
- What did you do to me?
- Road flare.

287
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,153
Cauterized the wound.

288
00:21:36,238 --> 00:21:38,990
You... burned me?

289
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:40,950
Yeah, I had to stop the bleeding.

290
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:42,494
No!

291
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,877
Bullet's still inside you.
Wouldn't move around, if I were you.

292
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,130
You expect me to say thank you?

293
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:57,259
If I didn't need you alive, we
wouldn't be having this conversation.

294
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,141
So you just stand there
and let me die, huh?

295
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:08,185
But you couldn't kill me yourself.

296
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,063
Is that where you draw the line?

297
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,446
Tell me what I want to know about Fisk.

298
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,490
You think you're different...

299
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:22,534
from me?

300
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,330
From him?

301
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,458
But you'll get there.

302
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:34,962
Sooner or later... we all do, men like us.

303
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:38,341
A man like Fisk just took
out your entire operation.

304
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:41,344
And he may not own all the cops,

305
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:44,431
but he owns enough that you
won't make it into a prison cell.

306
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:47,642
Right now, I'm your only shot at
getting out of this building alive.

307
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,403
His lapdog came to us first.

308
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,741
He told us his employer had taken note.

309
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:05,910
He complimented...

310
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,704
us on our business.

311
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:13,167
Invited us to be part
of something bigger...

312
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:16,504
to expand...

313
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:20,257
if we entered into an agreement.

314
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:21,759
What did Fisk offer?

315
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:24,053
Police looking other way...

316
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,349
aid from politicians...

317
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:33,855
and access to Chinese and their heroin.

318
00:23:33,938 --> 00:23:37,359
- He's working with the Chinese?
- You really don't know anything, do you?

319
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:42,614
Just snapping at scraps falling from table.

320
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:43,781
I want names.

321
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:46,225
Everything you know about them
and how they connect to Fisk.

322
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:49,161
There's only one name that matters.

323
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:53,833
The man that can tie it all together.

324
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,084
Who?

325
00:23:57,712 --> 00:24:00,297
Have you heard of the name...

326
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,176
Leslie Shumway?

327
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,887
No, he work for Fisk?

328
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:11,308
American schools...

329
00:24:11,393 --> 00:24:12,894
Almost as bad as Russian.

330
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:14,437
Come on.

331
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:18,483
Leslie Shumway was an accountant...

332
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,570
to your... Al Capone.

333
00:24:22,654 --> 00:24:24,864
Okay, you know who Fisk's money man is.

334
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:27,825
Not just Fisk. He handled it...

335
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:31,996
for all of us.

336
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,165
Who is he? Where do I find him?

337
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:37,001
We were going to rule this city...

338
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:39,546
my brother and I.

339
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:41,423
Vladimir, the name!

340
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:43,800
His name...

341
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,428
His name...

342
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:49,013
is...

343
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,559
His name is...

344
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:07,114
This is not how I die.
This is not how it happens.

345
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:44,276
You see that, old timer? That's
you not mattering anymore.

346
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,072
Television's been around a
while. Maybe you've heard.

347
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:50,658
- Ah, funny guy. -
Yeah, a real crack-up.

348
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:54,954
How's it feel, Urich, knowing
that your day's passed?

349
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:58,708
You're like the freaking dinosaurs,
watching that big rock crashing into 'em.

350
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,127
I still got a few good stories in me.

351
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:03,880
Maybe you two'll pop up in one of them.

352
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:06,674
Night's young, never
know what might happen.

353
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:08,342
We good? You framed up?

354
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:12,054
Kyle, authorities have cornered
the suspects in the bombings

355
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,682
that occurred earlier this
evening in Hell's Kitchen,

356
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:17,309
believing they may have taken
a police officer hostage.

357
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:20,772
While they haven't released the name
of the police officer in question...

358
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:24,275
Matt, it's Karen, again. Uh, where are you?

359
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:28,655
Would you just please give
us a call when you get this?

360
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:31,991
He's still not answering.

361
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:34,744
- Did you try his apartment?
- Three times.

362
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,747
All right, let's not jump
to things people jump to.

363
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,310
Well, he's a blind guy in a war zone.

364
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:40,958
Seems like jumping's a
pretty reasonable option.

365
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:43,002
You don't know him like I do.

366
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:45,588
Sometimes I even forget he can't
see, the way he zips around.

367
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,883
So you're not worried?

368
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:53,470
I'm gonna go look for him.

369
00:26:53,555 --> 00:26:56,432
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no,
no. The hell you are.

370
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,600
Lay back.

371
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:02,188
I'm the closest he has to
family. He'd do the same for me.

372
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:06,693
I know... and I love that about
you guys, but don't be an idiot.

373
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:08,736
Wouldn't be the first time.

374
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:14,742
You've played the hero enough for one day.

375
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:17,494
You're here, and safe.

376
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:20,206
So let's keep it that way, okay?

377
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:32,051
I am gonna go check downstairs...

378
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:35,597
make sure Matt hasn't been brought in.

379
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:38,432
- Karen?
- Yeah?

380
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:42,436
Hell of a first date, huh?

381
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:46,190
I've, uh...

382
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:48,525
actually had worse.

383
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,335
This is
Matt Murdock. Leave a message.

384
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:09,714
Matt? It's Foggy.

385
00:28:10,882 --> 00:28:13,050
Where are you, buddy?

386
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,010
That wasn't very smart.

387
00:28:57,094 --> 00:28:58,721
But it was fun...

388
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,308
watching you bleed.

389
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:05,477
You think this is a game?

390
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:08,480
If it was...

391
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,443
you'd be losing.

392
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:39,929
No...

393
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,140
No...

394
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:49,438
Come on.

395
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,611
I'm not done with you yet. You hear me?

396
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:57,739
I'm not done with you yet.

397
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:09,000
What...

398
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,925
What...

399
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,094
You died.

400
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:22,554
I brought you back.

401
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,060
You lied, huh?

402
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:32,940
You can't even stand there and let me die.

403
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:37,528
No.

404
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:42,408
Not until you give me what I need on Fisk.

405
00:30:57,631 --> 00:31:00,676
Emergency Service Unit is en route.

406
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,554
Blake and Hoffman are clearing a channel.

407
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:25,701
Come on, let's go! Move! Move!

408
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:27,244
They're good
shots. Then shoot.

409
00:31:27,328 --> 00:31:29,455
Tell those guys, they
shoot anyone who moves.

410
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:31,165
We got ESU on the scene.

411
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:33,459
Everybody switch your
radios to channel five

412
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,294
and maintain radio discipline.

413
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:36,921
- What happens next, Detective?
- Don't know.

414
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:38,840
Maybe you finally get
a story worth printing.

415
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:40,007
Let's go, fellas.

416
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:17,586
What are you doing?

417
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,298
Finding us a way out.

418
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:49,618
I'd like to speak
to the man in the mask, please.

419
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:55,791
Hello.

420
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:18,605
Are you there? Can you hear me?

421
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:29,325
- Who is this?
- I think you know.

422
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:34,413
You've been asking about me.
I thought it was time we spoke.

423
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:41,378
- Say your name.
- You first.

424
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:47,009
That's what I thought.

425
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:52,139
You and I have a lot in common.

426
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:54,516
We're nothing alike.

427
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,353
That's what you'll tell yourself.

428
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:01,398
You're feeding off this
city... like a cancer.

429
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:04,110
I want to save this city, like you...

430
00:34:05,987 --> 00:34:07,571
only on a scale that matters.

431
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,698
Now tell that to the people you've hurt.

432
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,200
Young man...

433
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:13,702
life is not a fairy tale.

434
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:18,707
Not everyone deserves... a happy ending.

435
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:21,793
I'm gonna find you...

436
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:25,172
and I'm gonna make you
pay for what you've done.

437
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:26,798
No, you are not.

438
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:29,969
Not that I don't admire
what you're trying to do...

439
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,804
to change the world...

440
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:38,852
with nothing but desire
and your own two hands...

441
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:43,232
secure in the knowledge that
you're doing the right thing,

442
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,067
the only thing.

443
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:49,363
That's something that I do understand.

444
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,866
But we both can't have what we want.

445
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:55,452
So...

446
00:34:57,038 --> 00:34:58,872
your part...

447
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,960
in this drama, by
necessity, comes to an end.

448
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:10,301
It's gonna take a lot more than
a voice on a radio to stop me.

449
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:12,303
It's not me you need to worry about.

450
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:15,097
It's the city you just
blew the hell out of.

451
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:22,063
You...

452
00:35:22,146 --> 00:35:24,190
You think anyone's gonna believe that?

453
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:26,817
You're running around in a mask,

454
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,738
holing up with a known felon in
the wake of a series of bombings.

455
00:35:31,822 --> 00:35:35,242
There's that police officer
you're holding hostage, so...

456
00:35:35,326 --> 00:35:36,577
yes.

457
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:39,163
Actually, I do.

458
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:42,249
But it doesn't have to be this way.

459
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,000
The Russian...

460
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:45,461
is he alive?

461
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,004
I'm still here, you fat shit!

462
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:50,299
Does that answer your question?

463
00:35:51,508 --> 00:35:53,344
It's a one-time offer.

464
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:58,349
You kill the Russian,

465
00:35:58,432 --> 00:36:01,727
and we'll call the night a push.

466
00:36:03,062 --> 00:36:04,813
You know what he's done...

467
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:07,649
to women...

468
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,026
to children...

469
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:13,655
To the people of this city
that you claim to care about.

470
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,534
But do you know how much he enjoyed it?

471
00:36:17,618 --> 00:36:20,287
You just confirmed how important he is.

472
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:23,832
That must worry you, what he might tell me.

473
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,210
Which means he hasn't
told you anything yet.

474
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:32,424
You're a child playing at being a hero.

475
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:34,593
No, no, I'm not trying to be a hero.

476
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:36,595
I'm just a guy that got
fed up with men like you

477
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:38,722
and I decided to do something about it.

478
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:41,350
That's what makes you dangerous.

479
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:42,768
It's not the mask.

480
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:44,645
It's not the skills.

481
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,981
It's your ideology.

482
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,318
The lone man...

483
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:55,197
who thinks he can make a difference.

484
00:36:56,115 --> 00:36:57,574
I'm glad we could talk.

485
00:36:58,284 --> 00:36:59,451
I...

486
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:03,455
I respect your conviction...

487
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:06,708
even if it runs counter
with... with my own.

488
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,002
Yeah, keep telling yourself you've won.

489
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:12,005
It'll make what I'm gonna do
to you so much more satisfying.

490
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,550
Your part ends tonight.

491
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:17,428
And if that's true,
others will take my place.

492
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:19,263
They'll see what I was trying
to do and they'll make sure...

493
00:37:19,346 --> 00:37:21,223
No, they won't.

494
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:25,477
The city will burn you in effigy.

495
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:28,355
Your name, your very existence...

496
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:34,403
will be met with abhorrence and disgust.

497
00:37:37,531 --> 00:37:38,907
Do it.

498
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,336
You guys don't seem to be
doing much hostage negotiating.

499
00:37:51,587 --> 00:37:52,879
How many times, Urich?

500
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:55,299
I told you, back off!

501
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:56,758
You know, this is bullshit and you know it.

502
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,844
You want to start giving me
some straight answers, Detective?

503
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:01,087
Huh, Detective? You gonna
start being straight with me?

504
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:08,312
Blake!

505
00:38:08,395 --> 00:38:09,855
Shit!

506
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,234
Shit!

507
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,241
Get an EMT! Go! Go!

508
00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:21,450
Go!

509
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:34,213
- What did you do?
- What you forced me to do.

510
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,798
Goodbye.

511
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,426
I'm afraid we won't speak again.

512
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:41,262
Fisk...

513
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:44,306
Fisk!

514
00:38:45,224 --> 00:38:46,558
Fisk, answer me!

515
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:52,147
Tell our friends to roll the tape.

516
00:38:56,985 --> 00:39:00,155
...authorities ask
that you contact them immediately.

517
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,533
A deadly shooting just moments ago

518
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:06,453
as three of New York's finest have
been gunned down in Hell's Kitchen.

519
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:09,331
We still have little information as to who.

520
00:39:10,332 --> 00:39:12,834
We are just getting word
of a fast development

521
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:15,587
in the investigation into
the Hell's Kitchen explosions.

522
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,382
Turn it up.

523
00:39:18,465 --> 00:39:19,675
Hmm?

524
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,968
Turn it up. I want to hear this.

525
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,889
The authorities have
just released some video.

526
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:29,225
This is taken just moments
after the explosions

527
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,812
that stunned Hell's
Kitchen earlier tonight,

528
00:39:31,895 --> 00:39:33,439
pulled from a security camera.

529
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:37,526
And authorities believe this man
is responsible for the bombings,

530
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,613
possibly as part of an ongoing
feud with the Russian mob.

531
00:39:41,697 --> 00:39:43,156
Oh, my God.

532
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,366
That's him.

533
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,034
The same man suspected of

534
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,079
having just shot and killed
the three police officers

535
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:52,458
- at the scene of a standoff...
- That's the guy who saved my life.

536
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,626
This guy?

537
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,002
Jesus...

538
00:39:56,086 --> 00:39:57,212
You're lucky he didn't kill you.

539
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:59,172
I don't understand why he
would do something like this.

540
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:01,550
- He just didn't seem like...
- ...some sort of mask...

541
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,552
I don't know, he just didn't...

542
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,261
General rule...

543
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:07,066
guys who wear masks have something to hide,

544
00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:08,181
and it usually ain't good.

545
00:40:08,264 --> 00:40:10,309
Battleground of Hell's
Kitchen, one has to wonder

546
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:12,353
whose side is this man on?

547
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:31,663
It's really not a good time.

548
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:35,083
On the news... they're saying
that you shot those cops.

549
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,209
No.

550
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:38,629
It was Fisk.

551
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,006
It's all Fisk.

552
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:43,550
What's going on out there?

553
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:45,886
Hang on.

554
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:01,067
Claire.

555
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:05,864
Um...

556
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:09,325
- What you said, before I left...
- I was...

557
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,286
I'm sorry, I just...

558
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,997
No, don't be. It turns out you were...

559
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,541
You were right...

560
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:17,834
about me.

561
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:22,005
I just don't want you getting
caught up if it goes that way.

562
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:25,384
If we don't get a chance to talk again...

563
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,554
you take care of yourself.

564
00:41:30,514 --> 00:41:31,640
Matt?

565
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:34,267
Matt, wait!

566
00:41:43,276 --> 00:41:44,528
Clear!

567
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:45,946
Clear!

568
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,864
Clear!

569
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:03,171
Told you.

570
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,841
This is not how I die.

571
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:20,647
Second floor clear.

572
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:28,614
Officer Sullivan is dead.

573
00:42:28,697 --> 00:42:31,867
- I say again, Officer Sullivan is dead.
- What the fuck? No!

574
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:51,928
This way.

575
00:43:02,523 --> 00:43:03,690
Where are we?

576
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:06,610
Access tunnels.

577
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:09,653
The city was built on a network of
these, most of them sealed up years ago.

578
00:43:11,948 --> 00:43:14,576
All right, we have to keep
moving, find a way to the street.

579
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:40,686
Freeze!

580
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:04,918
Let's go.

581
00:44:11,091 --> 00:44:12,843
There are five more coming.

582
00:44:12,926 --> 00:44:15,554
All working for Fisk,
probably not even real cops.

583
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,764
We don't have time for this.

584
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:20,225
I think...

585
00:44:21,685 --> 00:44:23,061
maybe I stay.

586
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,815
We can still make it out of here.

587
00:44:28,483 --> 00:44:31,653
- You turn evidence on Fisk, we can...
- He controls...

588
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:33,780
all police...

589
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:35,240
judges.

590
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:39,285
There's only one way to
stop him, you know this.

591
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:40,954
No.

592
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:43,665
I'm not a killer.

593
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:45,792
The moment you put on the mask...

594
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,337
you got into cage with animals.

595
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,758
Animals don't stop fighting.

596
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:56,136
Not until one of them is dead.

597
00:45:09,024 --> 00:45:10,859
What Fisk did to me...

598
00:45:12,485 --> 00:45:14,154
he'll do to you.

599
00:45:16,698 --> 00:45:18,867
And he will do it...

600
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,119
to everyone you care about.

601
00:45:21,912 --> 00:45:24,289
Will you feel the same way then?

602
00:45:25,832 --> 00:45:27,709
Or will you be man...

603
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,422
and do what you know you must do?

604
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,468
The dermo who controls
money, his name is...

605
00:45:38,094 --> 00:45:40,263
Leland Owlsley.

606
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:45,101
He will give you what you think you want.

607
00:45:49,397 --> 00:45:51,399
But it won't be enough.

608
00:45:53,777 --> 00:45:55,737
You know that now, don't you?

609
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,160
Go.

610
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:26,517
Got something!

611
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:27,728
Move! Move! Move!

612
