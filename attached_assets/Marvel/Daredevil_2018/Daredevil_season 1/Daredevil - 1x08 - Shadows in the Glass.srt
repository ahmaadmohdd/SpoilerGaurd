1
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:47,283
Seven o'clock a.m.

2
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,044
Matt wouldn't understand.

3
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:36,213
You know what he would say.

4
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:38,298
That we're awesome?

5
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:41,051
No, that we're being stupid.

6
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,428
I prefer the term
"foolheartedly provocative."

7
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:46,348
Yeah, that's lawyer talk
for stupid. You want coffee?

8
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,184
If we're gonna be Nancy Drew-ing together,

9
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:52,021
I think a certain level
of honesty is required.

10
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:53,773
What? You don't like my coffee?

11
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,524
No, I hate it.

12
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:59,069
I appreciate the effort, but
the technique, or lack thereof...

13
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:00,780
My God, you are such a dick.

14
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:03,783
On occasion some dickery may leak
out, but doesn't mean I'm wrong.

15
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,159
Well, it means somethin'.

16
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:07,036
Okay, let's say we keep Matt in the dark.

17
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,495
How long do you think...

18
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,541
I should grow my hair? Matt,
what's your take on that?

19
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:14,543
- Mullet? Full pony?
- Holy shit.

20
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,045
- Did you fall down again?
- Oh, it's nothing.

21
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:18,798
- Don't tell me what?
- Damn it!

22
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:20,049
You heard that?

23
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:21,591
Guy's like a bat.

24
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:24,719
Not blind like a... I mean,
you know, with the hearing.

25
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,444
- Bats aren't blind, Foggy.
- They're not?

26
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:27,514
It's a myth.

27
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:29,308
So, we're good.

28
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,393
- Karen.
- Yeah?

29
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:34,479
What don't the two of you want me to know?

30
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,608
We're investigating Union Allied.

31
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,735
Remind me to keep you
off the witness stand.

32
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,321
- You can't be doing that.
- Why not?

33
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:44,907
For starters, you signed legal papers
and took money to leave it alone.

34
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,535
No, I signed papers saying that
I wouldn't go public and I won't.

35
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,413
- We have someone lined up for that part.
- What part?

36
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:55,125
Breaking the story that, uh...

37
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:58,503
Look, whoever is behind Union Allied,
or whatever they call themselves now,

38
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,465
they are trying to
strong-arm people like Elena

39
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:03,968
so that they can sweep
their homes away from them

40
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:05,677
and build condos no one can afford.

41
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,887
And what do you think's gonna happen

42
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:09,139
when these "whoevers" find
out what it is you're up to?

43
00:07:09,223 --> 00:07:11,766
- We already took care of it.
- Took care of what?

44
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:16,939
The, uh, guys who busted
up Elena's apartment.

45
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:20,567
They, uh, came after me when I
was leaving her place last night.

46
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,651
Are you okay?

47
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:22,945
Yes.

48
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:25,447
Foggy was following me.

49
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,075
- Mmm-hmm. Why? Why were you
following her? - She was acting funny.

50
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:30,452
- No, there was no funny.
- There was a little funny.

51
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:33,288
This is what I'm talking about.
There are things out there.

52
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,290
You can't be doing this. You're
gonna get yourselves hurt.

53
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:38,710
No, I have already been
hurt by those bastards.

54
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:41,964
You know, I don't care what I signed

55
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:44,508
or how much money they
paid me to forget. I don't.

56
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:46,218
And I'm not just going to
stick my head in the sand

57
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:50,180
and let it happen to somebody
else because I am scared.

58
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:53,100
Which I am... a lot.

59
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:57,437
And if you could see her
face, you'd know she means it.

60
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:59,189
Yeah, I kind of got that.

61
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:04,987
Right, who else is involved?

62
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,490
Who's helping you break whatever it
is you think you're gonna find out?

63
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,450
Ben Urich, from the Bulletin.

64
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:13,037
The one who wrote the Union Allied piece?

65
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,205
Karen's been working with
him. He seems like a good guy.

66
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,749
Yeah, everybody
does, until they aren't.

67
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:20,710
No, I trust Ben as much
as I do you or Foggy, Matt.

68
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:23,588
I know what I am doing.
I am not some kid...

69
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:26,675
Then don't act like one. Both of you.

70
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,511
I know you're just trying
to do the right thing here,

71
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:30,804
but we have to be smart about this.

72
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:31,889
We?

73
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:35,392
First rule, no more skulking
around, asking to get hurt.

74
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:38,353
We do this, it's gonna be on
our turf. The legal system.

75
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,397
That's not nearly as
heroic as you might think.

76
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,960
I don't want anyone to be a hero,
Karen. I want you to be safe.

77
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:45,735
And I want to protect this firm and
everything we're trying to build here.

78
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:49,031
We know the law. We'll
use it to our advantage.

79
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,491
Agreed?

80
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:53,827
Do we have a choice?

81
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:55,955
Not so much.

82
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:59,791
Yeah, okay.

83
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,168
So, what's the second rule?

84
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:05,755
I don't know, I'm making
this up as I go along.

85
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:13,680
I understand your position.
You need to understand mine!

86
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:19,769
He questions
the validity of your position.

87
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:23,357
I say it is of piss and shit.

88
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,028
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
Nevertheless, my point is valid.

89
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:31,115
You made guarantees.

90
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:33,242
- Which I met.
- The Black Sky is dead.

91
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:37,537
You asked that the docks
and your transit path

92
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,623
be clear of police interference.

93
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:43,627
Did you observe any police?

94
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:45,420
No.

95
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:47,881
Of course not, because I'm a man of honor!

96
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:50,842
It will be difficult to
locate another Black Sky.

97
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,762
They are extremely rare.

98
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:56,765
Perhaps you should have told
me the importance of your cargo

99
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,143
before you lost it.

100
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:08,986
He's asking
if you'd like to renegotiate

101
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:11,113
the terms of your relationship.

102
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:12,781
I'm...

103
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,910
sorry if I offended you.

104
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:19,079
My apologies.

105
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,143
You get that last part?

106
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:44,646
Yes, threats are clear in any language.

107
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,149
He needs to be taught some manners.

108
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:48,733
Leave it alone.

109
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:51,570
If the Russians had
spoken to you this way...

110
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,322
They aren't the Russians.

111
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:55,865
No, the Russians actually contributed.

112
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:58,285
Leland's financials, Gao's product,

113
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:02,706
and Vlad and Anatoly's distribution
until we absorbed that facet.

114
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,500
What do Nobu and his
men bring to the table?

115
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:08,670
What... What are they in all this?

116
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:10,464
A necessary evil.

117
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:15,219
I just... I don't like the way
he speaks to you, that's all.

118
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:18,388
Especially now, when
everything's going our way.

119
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:22,601
That's exactly when
you need to be cautious.

120
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,888
Can you please turn that down?

121
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:03,433
Your mom don't like music.

122
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,480
- I like it.
- That's 'cause you got taste.

123
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:10,440
I love music. Just not so loud.

124
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:12,901
What the hell good is
it if you can't hear it?

125
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:14,444
- Right, Willie?
- Right!

126
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:15,862
Never trust the quiet ones.

127
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,532
Those are the pricks that
are always up to something.

128
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:21,951
You cut it too short.

129
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:23,703
What did I tell you?

130
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:24,829
Sorry.

131
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:26,331
Sorry, what?

132
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:27,874
Sir.

133
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,170
Respect. You gotta give it if you want it.

134
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:33,297
Don't forget that.

135
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,798
Make the next one longer.

136
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:37,050
You want your pop's face in the dirt?

137
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:38,343
- No, sir.
- Damn right.

138
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:47,060
You see that? That's our ticket.

139
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,812
Once you get on the city council,

140
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:51,356
everybody wants to put a
little somethin' in your pocket.

141
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:54,776
Remember Mr. Flores from up the street?

142
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,403
- No.
- 'Course not.

143
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,238
You know why? 'Cause he got on the council

144
00:12:58,322 --> 00:12:59,531
back when you were still
shitting in your pants.

145
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,032
Bill!

146
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,367
But he ain't around no more.

147
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:07,372
One year after he got voted in,
packed up, got himself a real house.

148
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:08,623
Really?

149
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:10,209
Just like we're gonna buy.

150
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:15,797
This city? It's everything.

151
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:17,799
It's right there.

152
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:21,761
All you gotta do is put your
mind to it and make it happen.

153
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:25,390
You want a sip?

154
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:26,558
- He most certainly does not.
- Huh?

155
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:30,354
My dad let me take a sip from his
glass before I could talk. Go on.

156
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:34,233
Go on. What are you lookin' at her for?

157
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:36,235
I said it's okay. Take a big one.

158
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:39,070
Go on.

159
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:42,657
That's it.

160
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:45,744
Bill, what are you doing? Jesus!

161
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:48,330
Come on, it's funny. He's a man.

162
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:49,456
Let him be a man.

163
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:52,292
- You worry too much.
- Somebody has to.

164
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:54,449
How are we paying for all this?

165
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,593
Got it covered. I took a loan.

166
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:02,927
A loan?

167
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:06,014
- What'd the bank make you put up?
- No, no, no. Screw the bank.

168
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,098
Rigoletto floated me.

169
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,726
- Rigoletto?
- Who's that?

170
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:13,480
Nobody, forget it.
It's an investment, Marlene.

171
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:16,483
You gotta spend money to make money.

172
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,611
Once I get on the council,
this is all taken care of.

173
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:22,614
- I don't know about all this.
- You don't know about nothin'!

174
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:24,491
You gotta take risks.

175
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:27,744
You want something out of life,
you gotta put yourself out there.

176
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:30,622
You gotta put yourself out there, Mom!

177
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:34,293
You see? The
kid is smarter than you.

178
00:14:40,424 --> 00:14:42,175
Yes, honestly.

179
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:46,305
I've spent most of my time abroad in Asia.

180
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:47,389
Yes.

181
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,140
I would.

182
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:51,935
Maybe, we...

183
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:54,563
We...

184
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:56,815
Could you please hold on a second?

185
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,278
Wait.

186
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:08,034
I'm so sorry. I need to take this.

187
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:13,332
I know, me, too. Good night, Vanessa.

188
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,168
Yes?

189
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,629
We have a situation.

190
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:22,591
- Nobu?
- Detective Blake, he just woke up.

191
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:26,595
Our contacts in the media tell us
that it's gonna be tonight's lead.

192
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:29,598
Has he said anything we
need to be concerned about?

193
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:32,392
No, he's conscious, but
his injuries were extensive.

194
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:33,768
I'm hearing he can't speak yet.

195
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,520
That changes,

196
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:38,189
unlikely he's gonna be
overjoyed we had him shot.

197
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,273
Yes.

198
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:40,692
Well...

199
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:43,528
take care of him.

200
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:45,905
That poses an issue.

201
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:48,992
There's a detail on his floor.
Twenty-four hour presence,

202
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:51,578
in case the man in the mask
tries to finish the job.

203
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,330
Are any of them ours?

204
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:57,334
Two... but not on the door. They
try to get in, it'll be noticed.

205
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:03,757
What about his partner, Hoffman?

206
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,302
I can reach out, but they go back,
since before the academy. I, uh...

207
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:10,639
I doubt he'll be receptive.

208
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,098
Set a meeting...

209
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:15,184
and I'll speak with him myself.

210
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:16,686
Understood.

211
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,360
This is pointless, Matt.

212
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:26,988
We should be out on the streets,
cracking names and taking skulls.

213
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:29,824
- I think you have that backwards.
- Not the way I do it.

214
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:33,036
Five minutes out there
and you'd end up in intensive care.

215
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,497
Hey, I handled myself pretty damn skippy

216
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,707
against baldy and his tattooed gorilla.

217
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,083
- Tell him, K.
- No, you did.

218
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,461
What? I'm... What, I'm "K" now?

219
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:43,755
- Trying something
new. - Mmm-mmm. Don't.

220
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:45,158
Wait, this is interesting.

221
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:48,301
Confederated Global Investments.

222
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:51,513
The company that hired us to
defend that bowling alley nut?

223
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,347
Yeah. Karen, do you have
a list of the subsidiaries

224
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:54,933
you were able to track
down through their check?

225
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:57,351
Uh, yeah, yeah, I think so.

226
00:16:58,812 --> 00:16:59,896
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

227
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:02,023
Can you tell me if...

228
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:07,028
Westmeyer-Holt Contracting is on the list?

229
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,698
Um...

230
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:11,616
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

231
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,326
There are half a dozen
complaints against them

232
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,537
for doing the same thing
they did at Elena's tenement.

233
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,956
Confed Global's trying to
force renters out of tenements?

234
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,667
What about Elena's
landlord? That Tully guy?

235
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,586
I mean, he's gotta know
something about this.

236
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:24,509
- See if I can track him down.
- Use the phone.

237
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:25,589
Oh, come on!

238
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:27,466
- I'm making that rule number two.
- Your rules suck.

239
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:30,259
- I want that on record.
- Fine, noted.

240
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:31,385
Oh, my God.

241
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,888
- What do you got?
- Uh, no, it's not, um...

242
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,348
The New York Bulletin online

243
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:39,436
just reported that that cop that got
shot, he just regained consciousness.

244
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,729
- Detective Blake?
- Yeah.

245
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:41,852
Guy's a real dick.

246
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:44,441
Still, he didn't deserve a
bullet from that masked douchebag.

247
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:47,527
Okay. Nobody knows
what really happened out there.

248
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:49,028
Detective Blake might.

249
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:50,739
Be interested in what he has to say.

250
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:52,991
Yeah, so would I.

251
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:54,784
We can't allow this to happen.

252
00:17:55,785 --> 00:18:00,289
I know that you have...
feelings regarding this matter.

253
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:02,375
I respect that.

254
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:09,633
But if Detective Blake
chooses to speak out of turn...

255
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:16,389
the result would be...
unpleasant, for you and for me.

256
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:19,100
Out of turn? You shot him.

257
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:23,688
Technically, we paid
someone else to shoot him.

258
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:27,025
Do you know what made us go down this path?

259
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:30,945
What led to a decision of such finality?

260
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:33,990
If you're worried about me, I
know how to keep my mouth shut.

261
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:37,536
If we doubted that, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

262
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:40,539
Being informed...

263
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:43,708
knowing facts as they are...

264
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,921
not how we wish to perceive them,

265
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:52,801
can tip the balance between life and death.

266
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:57,972
Unlike you, your partner was
inconsistent in his attention to detail.

267
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:00,892
Well, that masked asshole beat
him senseless and broke his arm.

268
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,351
It wasn't his fault.

269
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:06,397
Yes, I forgave him for
that. What I find indefensible...

270
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,067
is we were not alerted...

271
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,112
that the addresses we
provided had been compromised.

272
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:18,201
They were given to ensure that any
Russian who survived the bombings

273
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:21,538
would be properly attended to.

274
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:26,000
Not to aid the man in the mask
at locating Vladimir Ranskahov.

275
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:29,629
That led to an unfortunate complication.

276
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,635
One that your partner was
directly responsible for.

277
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:37,721
Yeah.

278
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:41,850
So, how long before I do
something that pisses you off?

279
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:45,394
Oh, the answer to that
is entirely up to you.

280
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,905
See, he's more than my partner, right?

281
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:57,782
He's my friend.

282
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:01,745
I've known him since I was
a kid. That's 30, 35 years.

283
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,921
How much...

284
00:20:12,964 --> 00:20:15,466
are each of those years worth to you?

285
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:17,510
Hmm?

286
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:20,096
In round figures?

287
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:08,144
- Hey.
- Hey.

288
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:09,228
Good news, right?

289
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:10,939
Yeah, he always was a tough son of a bitch.

290
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:13,316
Yeah. Hey, you gotta sign in.

291
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:15,234
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

292
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:20,699
- And I gotta check the bag.
- Yeah.

293
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,536
Mmm, meatball?

294
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,621
Yeah, from Marchioni's.
He loves that place.

295
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:29,749
I don't know, I thought
it might trigger something.

296
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,292
- Yeah. Well, come on in.
- Thanks.

297
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,325
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:22,719
What are you doin'?

299
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:58,129
I need you to listen to
me. We don't have much time.

300
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,589
Whatever your partner
just injected you with

301
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:02,341
has already reached your heart.

302
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:05,386
You're gonna be dead soon.

303
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:07,189
And there's nothing anyone can do about it.

304
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:10,766
But you can make the man responsible
for this pay for what he's done.

305
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:12,977
Hoffman!

306
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:15,104
Tell me everything you
know about Wilson Fisk.

307
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:20,484
- Hoffman! Open the door!
- Is it my turn for this?

308
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:23,414
Hoffman, what the hell
is going on in there?

309
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:30,119
- Go! Go!
- Get in there!

310
00:23:30,203 --> 00:23:31,537
Move, move, move!

311
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:34,833
- Move!
- Come on! Let's go!

312
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,792
Go!

313
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:45,384
Look at my face. I can't go
into the office like this.

314
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:49,055
I'm afraid to go anywhere with that
masked psychopath running around.

315
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:52,266
My son was coming to visit.

316
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,517
I had to tell him,

317
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:56,855
"Nope, stay out of New
York, Lee. Shit's goin' on."

318
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:59,398
I'm 73 years old.

319
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:01,943
You know how many times
I have left to see him?

320
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:04,988
I apologize for the inconvenience, Leland.

321
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:07,531
I'm not looking for... Are you done?

322
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:09,450
This thing itches like a son of a bitch.

323
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,202
It'll keep you safe when he's finished.

324
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:14,705
What's this coated with?

325
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:18,251
Polyethylene, glycol, silicate.

326
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:22,671
- Hydro-clusters form when kinetic
energy... - Yeah, great. I'm a 46" long.

327
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:26,217
- That'll be all, Mr. Potter.
- Okay.

328
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:30,013
You need anything else, Mr. Fisk, sir?

329
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,848
- Not today, Mr. Potter. Thank you.
- Okay.

330
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:38,604
Kid's half an idiot.

331
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:41,565
It's the other half that counts.

332
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:42,650
So...

333
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:46,445
what am I supposed to do here? Seriously?

334
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:47,655
He knows who I am.

335
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:51,325
He found me once, he'll do it again.

336
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:55,371
I'll move you someplace
safe until it's resolved.

337
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:58,166
- I'll put six men on you.
- Make it a dozen.

338
00:24:58,249 --> 00:24:59,583
If he drops me off a roof,

339
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,086
an awful lot of money is
going along for the ride.

340
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:05,839
- That sounds like a threat.
- No, just stating the obvious.

341
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,634
Never thought I'd have to with you.

342
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:16,642
Is it taken care of?

343
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,519
Yes, but there was a complication.

344
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:22,231
Well, there's a word I'm
hearing more and more.

345
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:23,441
What happened?

346
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:25,443
Right after Hoffman injected Blake,

347
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,362
he was incapacitated by our masked friend.

348
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:30,531
When Blake was still alive?

349
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,366
And talking, according to Hoffman.

350
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,911
That's
great. That's wonderful.

351
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:36,996
So we have no idea

352
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,333
what the guy you had shot
might have said to the whack job

353
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,085
you had framed for it?

354
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:45,546
- No, but there is
an upside. - Mmm-hmm.

355
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,173
Hoffman was able to spin it.

356
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:50,259
Told everyone he was assaulted
by the man in the mask,

357
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:51,844
then he finished what
he started with Blake.

358
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,804
So we're not exposed on that front.

359
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:57,100
Well, let's have a parade.

360
00:25:57,183 --> 00:25:59,852
This guy, Hoffman, how much does he know?

361
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,396
We're taking care of it, Leland.

362
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,316
Well, that fills me with warm comfort.

363
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,654
Situation's being handled, all right.

364
00:26:10,738 --> 00:26:12,490
Just not by you.

365
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,995
You're gonna
be all right, Wilson.

366
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,080
It's okay, honey.

367
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:21,582
Have some Zuppa, okay?

368
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,667
- I'm not hungry.
- You eat it.

369
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,378
It'll make you feel better.

370
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:29,840
- Are you having some?
- Sure, baby.

371
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:39,933
Mmm.

372
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:45,398
Do you think it's true? What Bernie said?

373
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:48,609
You can't listen to people like that.

374
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,279
You have to just block them out.

375
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:54,948
The hell happened to you?

376
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,825
It's all right, I've got this.

377
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,371
You feed him too much of that shit.

378
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,956
You want him to get
fatter than he already is?

379
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:05,084
- Bill!
- Come on, what happened?

380
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:08,582
- It was that Bernie Walker kid...
- Am I asking you?

381
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,550
What did he do?

382
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,010
He was knocking your signs down.

383
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:17,930
I told him to stop, but he wouldn't.

384
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,892
He said I was a loser... just like my dad.

385
00:27:25,438 --> 00:27:26,439
Get your coat.

386
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,443
Get your coat!

387
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:43,331
Hey!

388
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,167
That him?

389
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:52,215
You been knocking down my signs?

390
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:54,258
Yeah, so? Election's over.

391
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:57,142
Doesn't give you the right to destroy
other people's property, does it?

392
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,056
Oh, you're not running your mouth now, huh?

393
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,184
My boy said you had plenty to say to him.

394
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:06,312
I put myself out there.

395
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:10,733
You think it's my fault they
don't see it, what I could bring?

396
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:13,861
You wanna call me a loser
to my face, you little shit?

397
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:15,696
I didn't call you a loser, man.

398
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,615
Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?

399
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,032
He say it, or not?

400
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:21,535
- Speak up when I'm talking to you.
- He said it.

401
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:24,372
No, I didn't. My dad did.

402
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:25,539
I was just repeating it.

403
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,293
You think that's funny?

404
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,755
Huh? What a man tries to do?

405
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:35,924
- How he puts himself out there?
- Whatever, man, Jesus.

406
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,636
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.

407
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:39,720
Dad!

408
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:44,975
Say something funny!

409
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,852
Say something funny! Go ahead!

410
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:47,936
Dad, stop!

411
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,857
Huh?

412
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,484
- Come here.
- Dad...

413
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,486
Come here. Come here.

414
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:58,822
Come here.

415
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,618
It's people like this
that wanna keep you down.

416
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,703
Keep you afraid.

417
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:07,498
You have to show 'em that
that can never happen.

418
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,293
You gotta show 'em that you're a man.

419
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:11,960
Kick him.

420
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:16,257
Don't give me that look like your
mother. You do what I tell you. Kick him.

421
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,342
Kick him!

422
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:22,777
Kick him again.

423
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:25,141
Kick him!

424
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:28,602
Keep kicking him! Kick him!

425
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:30,313
Harder!

426
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:33,691
Kick him! Kick him!

427
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:35,693
Harder!

428
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:37,713
Yes?

429
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:41,884
Gao reached out. She'd like a word.

430
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,428
- Send the car around.
- She's coming to you.

431
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:46,096
Now.

432
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,810
Can you be here before she arrives?

433
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:54,230
I'm already on my way.

434
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,189
Thank you, Wesley.

435
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:11,372
She
approves of your choice of tea.

436
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:16,419
I picked it up on my last
visit to your country.

437
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,213
I thought you might enjoy it.

438
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,670
She
says she didn't come for tea.

439
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:33,436
He does not need you to form my words.

440
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,812
Do you, Wilson?

441
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,648
You speak English.

442
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,150
I speak many languages.

443
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:43,946
How many?

444
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,073
All of them.

445
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:53,289
And you speak my tongue,

446
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:54,373
do you not?

447
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,168
How long have you known?

448
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,921
Since the beginning.

449
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:05,008
It is the clever man who plays the fool.

450
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:07,135
And a foolish woman...

451
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:08,259
who does not recognize it.

452
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,851
Tell me,

453
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:19,773
has Nobu guessed you
speak Japanese as well?

454
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:22,485
I don't believe so, no.

455
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:27,197
You may leave us.

456
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,121
Wait outside.

457
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:46,299
Nobu
isn't very happy with you.

458
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:51,472
That man is never happy with anyone.

459
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:53,432
True.

460
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:56,352
But...

461
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:58,311
I have heard Leland...

462
00:32:58,396 --> 00:33:00,481
is equally displeased.

463
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:04,151
It's under control.

464
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,987
How do you think...

465
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,407
I knew where you live, Wilson?

466
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:14,495
This is one of your most guarded secrets,

467
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:16,580
yes?

468
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:19,417
The king in his castle.

469
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:25,506
Did I divine the location
from bones and spells,

470
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:30,052
chanted beneath the moonlight?

471
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:32,262
No.

472
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:37,518
I discovered it because...

473
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,145
you have become sloppy.

474
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,232
And emotional.

475
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:49,572
Just as the Russians became,

476
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:51,198
in their final moments.

477
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:03,001
Recent events have been trying,

478
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,670
I admit.

479
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,630
But I promise...

480
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:12,720
I am not here to pluck
flowers from a thicket.

481
00:34:13,596 --> 00:34:15,889
This is a courtesy,

482
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:18,476
because you have shown me respect.

483
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:28,193
Restore your house to order.

484
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:33,198
Or I will begin dealing...

485
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,826
with Nobu and Leland directly.

486
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:43,041
Gratitude for the tea.

487
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,312
Get out.

488
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,441
Sir, if there's anything I can bring...

489
00:35:08,526 --> 00:35:10,986
Get out!

490
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:24,291
Think of the man you wanna be.

491
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,460
You sit here and you stare at that wall

492
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:30,548
and you think about that.

493
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:31,924
You're my son.

494
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:35,511
You should be a king,
not some fat little pussy.

495
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:38,681
Sit.

496
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,936
What'd I say? Don't look
at me, look at the wall.

497
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,941
Don't take your eyes off till I get back.

498
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:52,141
It's late, where are you going?

499
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:53,946
I gotta take care of
something, what's it matter?

500
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:55,614
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

501
00:35:55,698 --> 00:35:58,491
No, Marlene, it can't, all right?

502
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:03,831
I gotta talk
to Rigoletto... tonight.

503
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,125
- Oh, Jesus.
- Don't worry.

504
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:09,294
- How much you owe him?
- Don't worry about it.

505
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:11,421
- How much?
- I got it covered.

506
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:12,624
That's all you need to know.

507
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:15,843
You know, I told you, you shouldn't
have borrowed money from him.

508
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:18,136
But no, you had to be the big shot, huh?

509
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,181
You had to have your face plastered all...

510
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:23,851
It's not enough I get that shit out there?

511
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:27,354
I gotta get it in my own
house? In my own house?

512
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,440
- Bill! No, no, no, no, no!
- Shut up! Shut up!

513
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,275
- Shut up!
- No, please!

514
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,945
- Shut up! Shut up!
- No, please! No!

515
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:37,573
Shut up!

516
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:54,006
I didn't call for you.

517
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,884
No, I just thought you
might need something.

518
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,302
If I needed you, I would've asked.

519
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:03,515
I don't think that's always true, sir.

520
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:27,455
We'll be all right. Thank you.

521
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:36,548
I like your place.

522
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,718
Not sure about the table.

523
00:37:39,802 --> 00:37:41,962
- Looks like you aren't, either.
- Please go.

524
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:45,432
If that's what you really want.

525
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:55,192
He's worried about you... your friend.

526
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:56,860
Ah, he shouldn't be.

527
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,363
You made a promise...

528
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,034
to always be honest with me.

529
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,536
What is it?

530
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,043
I'm afraid.

531
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,920
Of what?

532
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,090
The way you'd look at me if you knew.

533
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,187
Tell me.

534
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,316
Shut up! No, please!

535
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,276
Shut
up! I don't wanna hear it!

536
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,800
- I lost because of you!
- No!

537
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,488
- Because of this family.
- No!

538
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:43,073
They see it!

539
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:45,826
They see you and that little
bastard and they laugh!

540
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:49,037
- And you don't believe in me!
- I do.

541
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,498
- And you see what happens?
- No!

542
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:53,375
- You see what happens?
- No!

543
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:56,253
Oh, God, no!

544
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:00,799
You don't believe in me! Shut up!

545
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:01,925
Stop it!

546
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:10,142
What are you gonna do
with that, fatty? Huh?

547
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,352
Huh?

548
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,273
That's what I thought.

549
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,985
You believe this kid? He
gets that shit from you.

550
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,121
Oh, God.

551
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:41,339
Keep kicking
him! Keep kicking him!

552
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,676
Keep kicking him!

553
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:48,889
Keep kicking him!

554
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:52,017
Wilson...

555
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,937
- It's okay.
- Mommy.

556
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,856
It's all right. It's all right,
baby. It's all right.

557
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,027
It's all right. It's okay. It's
okay. It's okay. It's okay, baby.

558
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,487
It's okay.

559
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,952
Okay.

560
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,416
Get the saw.

561
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:13,681
We carried him in bags down to the river.

562
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:17,185
One every night, for the next week.

563
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,606
Everyone in town knew that
he owed money to Rigoletto.

564
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:24,151
So, I guess they thought that...

565
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:26,403
he'd left town to avoid him.

566
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:31,366
My mother, she sent me
to live with relatives

567
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:33,368
on the farm that I told you about.

568
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:36,704
It wasn't your fault.

569
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,708
You were protecting your mother.

570
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:45,255
I didn't do it for her. I did it for me.

571
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,509
That's
why I still wear these.

572
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:53,096
To remind myself that I'm not
cruel for the sake of cruelty!

573
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,973
That I'm not my father!

574
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:57,267
That I'm not a monster!

575
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,603
Am I?

576
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,691
No, Wilson.

577
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:07,110
You aren't.

578
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:21,374
But soon it won't matter.

579
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,544
There are people out there
that want to expose me.

580
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,967
They don't understand what
I'm trying to do for this city.

581
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,428
They want to drag my
name through the streets!

582
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:36,473
They want to destroy everything
that I'm trying to accomplish.

583
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:42,604
And are you going to let them?

584
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:48,944
No.

585
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:56,868
It was a total bust. No, I...

586
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,956
Ellison. Ellison, no...

587
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,875
He's a crazy old man in a tinfoil hat.

588
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:09,381
And why are we chasing
a story like this anyway?

589
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:10,882
What?

590
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,718
Shit.

591
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:16,429
Look, can I call you back?
I'm drowning out here.

592
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,390
Yes, yes, okay. Fine.

593
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:31,861
We need to talk.

594
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:37,492
Do you know who I am?

595
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:44,957
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

596
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,709
Do you believe that?

597
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:49,254
What they're saying about me?

598
00:43:49,337 --> 00:43:52,590
You've been in an awful lot of wrong
places at the wrong time lately.

599
00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:54,801
But I've heard the other stories.

600
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:58,055
About the man in the mask, helping people.

601
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,599
Sounds like maybe there's
more than one side to you.

602
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:05,395
I didn't blow the hell out of the Russians.

603
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:07,272
And I didn't shoot those cops.

604
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:09,232
So, what?

605
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:10,942
You want me to write your side of this?

606
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:14,529
No, I want you to expose
the man responsible.

607
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:18,241
The man who's tearing this
city apart, piece by piece.

608
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,368
You got a name?

609
00:44:20,452 --> 00:44:21,536
Wilson Fisk.

610
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,997
- Never heard of him.
- Because he doesn't want you to.

611
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:26,166
That's what makes him dangerous.

612
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:28,129
Living in the shadows,
no one knowing who he is.

613
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:30,753
Said the man in the mask.

614
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:35,925
- I'm trying to protect this city.
- Maybe.

615
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:39,846
But right now they hate you. And
have no idea who this Fisk guy is.

616
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:41,806
You can change that.

617
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:43,600
So could 100 other reporters.

618
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:45,102
Why me?

619
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:47,520
There are good people who trust you, Ben.

620
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:49,939
I have faith in their judgment.

621
00:44:51,983 --> 00:44:53,818
Union Allied.

622
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:00,032
Guessing that was you who dumped that
guy on the doorsteps of the Bulletin?

623
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:02,076
I think he's connected to Fisk.

624
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,620
That woman you saved that night?

625
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:05,413
She's a good kid.

626
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:10,627
Still believes you're a hero,
despite what everybody's saying.

627
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,170
People like her are why I do this.

628
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:16,174
If I do the smart thing and say no?

629
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:19,927
Then I'll have to stop him some other way.

630
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,096
That has a ring of finality to it.

631
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,515
I'm not a killer.

632
00:45:24,557 --> 00:45:26,058
I keep telling people that.

633
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,478
But that could change, couldn't it?

634
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:38,405
What do you got?

635
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:40,282
Bits and pieces.

636
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,242
Russians... Triads... Yakuza...

637
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:45,077
all funneling money through
a man named Leland Owlsley.

638
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:48,206
The Wall Street guy?
How'd you get all this?

639
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:50,542
How do you think?

640
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,210
So all you got is what
you've beaten out of people?

641
00:45:54,837 --> 00:45:57,131
- I can't print that without credible...
- Detective Blake...

642
00:45:57,215 --> 00:45:59,217
I was at the hospital when he died.

643
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,803
Yeah, they're saying
you sent him on his way.

644
00:46:03,137 --> 00:46:06,766
It was his partner, Hoffman.
They both worked for Fisk.

645
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:09,811
Blake gave Fisk up, before he went.

646
00:46:09,894 --> 00:46:11,229
You get this on tape?

647
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:15,733
Somebody else in the room
to corroborate what he said?

648
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:20,738
I need reliable sources.

649
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:23,908
A bunch of "he said, she said"
is not gonna put this guy away.

650
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:27,329
We don't need to put him away.
Just drag him into the light.

651
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:28,496
Give him nowhere to hide.

652
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,957
Once the city knows who he is...

653
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,750
they'll tear him apart.

654
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:39,591
And this is the guy at the
top. You sure about that?

655
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:41,551
I'd bet my life on it.

656
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:45,347
You're betting mine now, too.

657
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,769
Tell me everything you know.

658
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:27,389
"'You get what you deserve.'

659
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,599
It's an old saying.

660
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:32,310
One that survived the
years, because it's true.

661
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:33,436
For the most part.

662
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,813
But not for everyone.

663
00:47:35,897 --> 00:47:38,733
Some get more than they deserve.

664
00:47:38,816 --> 00:47:42,153
Because they believe they
aren't like everyone else.

665
00:47:42,236 --> 00:47:45,448
That the rules, the ones
people like me and you,

666
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:50,244
the people that work and struggle
to live our lives, just live,

667
00:47:50,328 --> 00:47:51,829
don't apply to them.

668
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:55,708
That they can do anything
and live happily ever after,

669
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,752
while the rest of us suffer.

670
00:47:58,836 --> 00:48:00,838
They do this from the shadows.

671
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:03,049
Shadows that we cast.

672
00:48:03,132 --> 00:48:05,552
With our indifference.

673
00:48:05,635 --> 00:48:07,970
With a pervasive lack
of interest in anything

674
00:48:08,054 --> 00:48:12,224
that doesn't directly affect
us, we, in the here and now.

675
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:17,397
Or maybe it's just the shadow of weariness.

676
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,857
Of how tired we are,

677
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:24,779
struggling to claw our way back to
a middle class that no longer exist,

678
00:48:24,862 --> 00:48:27,824
because of those who take
more than they deserve.

679
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:29,742
And they keep taking,

680
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:32,662
until all that's left for the rest of us

681
00:48:32,745 --> 00:48:35,665
is a memory of how it used to be

682
00:48:35,748 --> 00:48:38,418
before the corporations
and the bottom line decided

683
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:39,961
we didn't matter anymore.

684
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:42,339
But we do.

685
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:47,427
You and I, the people of this city...

686
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,971
we still matter.

687
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:54,851
There's someone in Hell's Kitchen
that doesn't share this belief.

688
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:57,854
He's been among us for quite some time.

689
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:01,315
You've never heard his name.
You've never seen his face.

690
00:49:01,399 --> 00:49:02,859
He's stayed in the shadows.

691
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:08,365
Because men like him, men that
want to control our city, our lives,

692
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:11,325
fear the light and what it reveals.

693
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:16,122
This man must no longer be
allowed to operate in the darkness.

694
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:20,793
If he has nothing to hide,
let him step forward."

695
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:25,131
I'm not very good
at this, out, being in public.

696
00:49:26,716 --> 00:49:29,301
But I felt the need to
speak up for this city

697
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,971
that I love with all my heart.

698
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:35,141
No one should have to live in fear.

699
00:49:37,852 --> 00:49:40,605
In fear of madmen...

700
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:43,190
who have no regard for who they injure.

701
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:46,110
In fear of the Devil of Hell's Kitchen,

702
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:49,030
who has inflicted untold
pain and suffering.

703
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:54,368
This masked terrorist and
psychopaths of his kind,

704
00:49:54,452 --> 00:49:56,162
we must show them

705
00:49:56,245 --> 00:50:03,085
we will not bow down to their
campaign of coercion and intimidation.

706
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:06,798
We must stand up to them.

707
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:10,593
As this man, my dearest
friend, Leland Owlsley,

708
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,720
a pillar in the financial community,

709
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:15,682
stood up when he was recently assaulted.

710
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:19,644
But this assault was for no other
reason than to send me a message.

711
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:22,564
A message warning me to stop.

712
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:25,608
To give up my dream that
I have for this city.

713
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:28,110
A dream of a better place.

714
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:33,115
A place for its citizens to feel safe.

715
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:35,660
To feel pride.

716
00:50:35,743 --> 00:50:37,912
I tried to do this quietly,

717
00:50:37,995 --> 00:50:39,956
not wanting to draw attention.

718
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:41,624
The last thing I wanted

719
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:44,001
was for anyone close to me

720
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:47,379
to become a target from those
who do not share my dream.

721
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:52,510
For those who will have this
city stay exactly as it is,

722
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:55,555
mired in poverty and crime.

723
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:58,975
But I know now it was
foolish to make that decision.

724
00:50:59,058 --> 00:51:01,894
That I can no longer do it alone.

725
00:51:01,978 --> 00:51:05,314
That I cannot keep living in the shadows...

726
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:08,359
afraid of the light.

727
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:12,154
None of us can. None of
us should be forced to.

728
00:51:13,114 --> 00:51:15,575
We must do this together.

729
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:20,580
We must resist those who
would have us live in fear.

730
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:26,711
My name...

731
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,297
is Wilson Fisk.

732
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:35,261
And together, we can make
this city a better place.

733
