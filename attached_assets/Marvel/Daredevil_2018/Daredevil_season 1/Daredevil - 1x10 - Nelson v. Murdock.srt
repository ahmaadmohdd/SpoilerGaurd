1
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:41,434
Oh, God.

2
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:14,291
Wouldn't do that if I were you.

3
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:20,756
Then again, maybe I would.

4
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:24,467
The hell do I know about Matt Murdock?

5
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,179
- You stitched me up?
- Nope.

6
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:31,224
That was your nurse friend.

7
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:32,976
Claire?

8
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:34,519
You had me get a hold of her

9
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:37,022
after you took a swing at me for
trying to get you to the hospital.

10
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,150
I don't remember.

11
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:42,903
Sorry.

12
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,365
She was hot, by the way.

13
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,119
But I guess you already knew that, huh?

14
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:53,455
- Foggy...
- Just tell me one thing, Matt.

15
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,792
Are you even really blind?

16
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,400
God damn it! Come on!

17
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,154
Load. Load!

18
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:09,864
- What?
- Excuse me, is this room 312?

19
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:12,325
Yeah, who're you looking for?

20
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,371
Oh... uh, sorry.

21
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,749
- What for?
- You're blind, right?

22
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,585
Uh, yeah, so they tell me.

23
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,630
- I hope that won't be a problem.
- Why would it?

24
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,340
Oh!

25
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:29,009
You're... You're my roomie!

26
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,928
Uh, Matt Murdock.

27
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,139
Foggy Nelson.

28
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,101
Wait, Matt Murdock? Are you...

29
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,478
- You're not from Hell's Kitchen, are you?
- Yeah, born and raised.

30
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,605
So am I!

31
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,482
Yeah, I heard about
you when you were a kid,

32
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,859
what you did, saving that
guy crossing the street.

33
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:49,529
Yeah, I... I just did
what anyone would have.

34
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:51,698
Bullshit. You are a hero.

35
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:52,991
I'm really not.

36
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:55,577
Come on! You got your peepers
knocked out saving that old dude.

37
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,120
They didn't get knocked out.

38
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,413
Good,

39
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:01,874
'cause that would be... a
little freaky. But no offense.

40
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,294
Please, none taken. Uh...

41
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:09,341
Most people dance around me like
I'm made of glass. I hate that.

42
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:12,344
Yeah, you're just a guy, right?

43
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:15,305
A really, really good-looking guy.

44
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,016
Oh, um...

45
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:22,270
I mean, girls must love that, the whole...

46
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,189
wounded, handsome duck thing.

47
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,316
- Am I right?
- Right.

48
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,026
Yeah, it's been known to happen.

49
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,945
This is gonna be awesome!

50
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:31,154
What is?

51
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,489
Me as your wingman!

52
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:36,034
You're gonna open up a whole caliber
of women I've only dreamed of.

53
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:37,619
A lot!

54
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:39,162
We're gonna be like Maverick and Goose!

55
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,622
Okay.

56
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,249
Oh, shit!

57
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,876
Yes.

58
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,003
I'm in!

59
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,964
- In what?
- Punjabi. I got the last spot.

60
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:51,091
You're taking Punjabi?

61
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:54,594
It's spoken by 130 million people.
I'd like to know what they're saying.

62
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:57,555
- That's the only reason?
- Well, yeah.

63
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,600
I mean, why else would I learn it?

64
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,853
I don't know... a girl, maybe?

65
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,107
See? This is what I'm talking about.

66
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,652
Me and you... Maverick
and Goose, no secrets.

67
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:13,363
Goose died... and he was married.

68
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,572
Details.

69
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:17,159
Hey, do you know a good place
to get a cup of coffee on campus?

70
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:19,327
- No.
- Well, lucky for you, I do.

71
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:21,704
And it's filled with
luscious coeds. Shall we?

72
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,206
Yeah, lead the way.

73
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,627
So, you can see.

74
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,920
That's not... You're not...

75
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,131
Are you even listening to what I'm saying?

76
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:34,676
Yeah, world on fire, I got
it. But you can see, right?

77
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,137
Yeah, in a manner of speaking. But I...

78
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,513
No! No manner!

79
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,599
How many fingers am I holding up?

80
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,477
One.

81
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,326
All these years, I
actually felt sorry for you.

82
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,953
I didn't ask for that. I
never... I never asked for that.

83
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:04,247
Yeah, I didn't ask to be lied to.

84
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,166
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

85
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:08,668
You've lied to me, Matt,
since the day we met.

86
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,088
What did you expect me to say, Foggy?

87
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,632
"Hi, I'm Matt. I got some chemicals
splashed in my eyes when I was a kid

88
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,509
that gave me heightened senses."

89
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,052
Well, maybe not lead with that.

90
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:20,930
I didn't even tell my
dad after it happened.

91
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,307
But you told that nurse, Claire.

92
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,392
Because I didn't have a choice.

93
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,063
She found me in a dumpster,
all right? Half dead.

94
00:06:29,147 --> 00:06:30,690
She didn't... She didn't tell you?

95
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:34,026
She wouldn't say anything about all this.

96
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,197
She seemed nice.

97
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,491
She is.

98
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:55,382
Did you blow up those
buildings? Shoot those cops?

99
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:58,009
You really even need to ask that?

100
00:06:58,092 --> 00:07:00,512
Yeah, I think I do.

101
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,475
It was Fisk.

102
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,436
It was all Fisk.

103
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:12,399
- He did this to you?
- He and Nobu.

104
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:13,691
Nobu?

105
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:16,986
Yeah, I think he's some kind of... ninja.

106
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,282
A ninja.

107
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:21,741
I think.

108
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:24,369
What are you doing, Matt?

109
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,829
You're a lawyer. You're
supposed to be helping people.

110
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,039
I am.

111
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:29,582
In a mask!

112
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,584
Do you know what they
call that? A vigilante.

113
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,378
Someone who acts outside of the law.

114
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:36,423
Karen. Karen.

115
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:40,468
Karen. Karen. Karen.

116
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:42,220
Foggy, Foggy, Foggy.

117
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:45,056
- She deserves to know.
- You can't tell her, Foggy, please.

118
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,724
Is this what you do?

119
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:50,312
When we call, trying to get
you to come out for drinks?

120
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:53,731
Trying to find you when bombs
are going off and we're worried?

121
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:55,733
Voicemail.

122
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,152
You just hit ignore?

123
00:07:58,486 --> 00:07:59,571
No.

124
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:08,455
- It's her again.
- Please, Foggy.

125
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,042
- Hey.
- Hey.

126
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,752
I tried calling Matt. Where are you guys?

127
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,213
We're at his place.

128
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,547
Is everything okay?

129
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,966
No, Matt was...

130
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:26,097
Matt was in an accident.

131
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,183
Oh, my God.

132
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:30,059
What happened?

133
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,270
He was in a car accident.

134
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:34,939
- Matt was driving?
- No, he, um...

135
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:36,858
He got hit.

136
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:40,237
Well, is he all right?
Look, I... I'm coming over.

137
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,322
No, stay at the office. We need you there.

138
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,991
- There's nothing you can do here.
- Okay.

139
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:47,827
- Foggy...
- I got this, Karen.

140
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:51,248
I'll call you if we need anything.

141
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,297
Thank you.

142
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:03,760
Screw you. I just lied to
somebody that I care about.

143
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,471
I want to know everything.

144
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,807
And don't you leave a damn thing out.

145
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:33,790
I have never seen
you, absent your man by your side.

146
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,460
No need for a translator now.

147
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,170
Or pretenses.

148
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:54,894
There was a snake, in the
village where I was raised...

149
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:59,649
who mistook an elephant as prey.

150
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,109
It died...

151
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:04,153
with its jaws wide...

152
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,741
clenched around no more
than the elephant's foot,

153
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:12,119
betrayed by ambition.

154
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,333
Am I the snake...

155
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,792
or the elephant?

156
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:22,797
What happened to Nobu was...

157
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,006
unfortunate.

158
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,884
I asked for a warrior...

159
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,471
to eliminate...

160
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:31,055
the Masked Man.

161
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:33,433
He chose to take it upon himself.

162
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:36,394
He is a man of pride.

163
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:39,105
Something well known to you.

164
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,399
What's done...

165
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:43,318
is done.

166
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:46,488
And the man in the mask...

167
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:48,490
you have found his body?

168
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,117
No.

169
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:54,954
Yet Nobu's clan...

170
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:57,039
prepare his...

171
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,501
for what is to come.

172
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,840
They are distracted.

173
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:08,510
But their memories...

174
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:11,513
and their knives...

175
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:14,516
are forever sharp.

176
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:18,478
Is that why you wanted to meet?

177
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,022
To warn me...

178
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:24,066
of what I already know?

179
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:28,530
I only sought to pose a question.

180
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:30,948
How long before...

181
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:34,285
your ambition turns to me?

182
00:11:36,538 --> 00:11:39,749
You always possessed
what the others did not.

183
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,208
My respect.

184
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,337
Perhaps.

185
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,590
Yet...

186
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,802
you are not the man who came to me...

187
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:52,845
with a dream...

188
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,889
for this city.

189
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,059
He was of a...

190
00:11:58,142 --> 00:11:59,644
singular mind.

191
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:05,817
Yours now is pulled in two directions...

192
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,987
by longings of the heart.

193
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:12,406
Is that why we're here?

194
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,366
To discuss...

195
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:15,993
my private affairs?

196
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,705
No.

197
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,915
We are here...

198
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:22,959
to discuss your fate.

199
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,174
I speak your tongue now.

200
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:34,303
So there is no mistaking my words.

201
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,016
There is conflict within you.

202
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,602
Conflict?

203
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:46,232
Man cannot be both savior and oppressor...

204
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:50,402
light and shadow.

205
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,991
One has to be sacrificed for the other.

206
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,958
Choose... and choose wisely.

207
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,301
Or others shall choose for you.

208
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:33,112
Hello, gorgeous.

209
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,252
Hello, handsome.

210
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:53,966
Mmm...

211
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,261
You're wearing that aftershave.

212
00:13:57,344 --> 00:14:00,014
- You remember?
- Of course, I do.

213
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:02,934
Always got me going.

214
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,145
I've missed you.

215
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:11,818
They say anything?

216
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:15,529
They, um...

217
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,825
They think you're improving.

218
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:24,956
What are you working on?

219
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,834
Uh...

220
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,794
It's nothing. Just, uh...

221
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,298
outsmarted by a story.

222
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:37,009
You'll figure it out. Always do.

223
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:41,513
There are more important
things than the job right now.

224
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:45,184
I should be here with you, not, uh...

225
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:49,480
chasing down leads,
getting my ass in trouble.

226
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:54,443
Your name is Ben Urich...

227
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,029
and you are a reporter.

228
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,617
It's not a job. It's who you are.

229
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:02,827
I don't know.

230
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:05,997
This was 20 years ago, maybe.

231
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:12,461
I was... more fearless then.

232
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:17,174
Don't see much of that guy now.

233
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,598
When we first met, you weren't fearless.

234
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:26,809
You were reckless... pushy.

235
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:31,856
You were all about making a
big splash, turning heads...

236
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:34,400
You certainly turned mine.

237
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,113
But that's not who you
were always supposed to be.

238
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:41,824
Experience made you more careful...

239
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,493
wise.

240
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,539
I don't know, Ben Urich...

241
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:52,794
I think your best work is still ahead.

242
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:58,007
You keep sweet-talking... I'm
gonna climb in there with you.

243
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,563
Doris?

244
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:15,858
Baby?

245
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:23,074
Hello, gorgeous.

246
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:29,997
Hello, handsome.

247
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,460
Ben?

248
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,172
I'll be right back.

249
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,474
Is this about the extension?

250
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:50,852
Let's speak outside, yeah?

251
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:02,697
- I'm sorry.
- How do you know you did everything?

252
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,281
I did everything.

253
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,684
The hell you get all this crap?

254
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,478
The Internet.

255
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,647
The Internet.

256
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:42,904
Thought you long-underwear types
stitched these together yourselves.

257
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,283
I never learned how to sew.

258
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:50,244
But you learned how to fight.

259
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:55,707
That news footage of you... in
the alley, after the bombings...

260
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,960
the way you were flipping around...

261
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,922
Your dad was a boxer.

262
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:02,673
He didn't teach you any
of that stuff, did he?

263
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:06,552
He didn't want me to fight. You know that.

264
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,095
So, how'd you get so good at it?

265
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:14,518
An old man named Stick.

266
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:16,520
You're shitting me.

267
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,272
He found me at the orphanage.

268
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,983
Blind like me.

269
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,195
Well, almost like me.

270
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:28,908
A blind old man... taught you
the ancient ways of martial arts.

271
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:30,910
Isn't that the plot to Kung Fu?

272
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:32,411
I know how it sounds.

273
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:34,997
I don't think that you do.

274
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,707
He did more than start my training.

275
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,335
He taught me that my blindness
wasn't a disability, that...

276
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,045
sight was a distraction.

277
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:45,049
He helped me understand
everything I could do.

278
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:46,884
Define "everything."

279
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:50,137
- It's hard to explain, Foggy.
- My abilities...

280
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:52,932
I just know things, okay?

281
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:54,558
No, not okay.

282
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:57,519
Can you read my mind? Can
you predict the future? What?

283
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,230
What things do you just know?

284
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:02,817
I know you haven't showered
since yesterday morning.

285
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,069
But you rinsed your
face in my kitchen sink.

286
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:10,199
I know you had onions in
your lunch two days ago.

287
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,701
I know you're hungry... and tired.

288
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,955
And I know the more I say,
the faster your heart beats.

289
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:21,335
You can hear a heartbeat?
From across the room?

290
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,545
Helps to anticipate behavior.

291
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:27,591
When someone's gonna
attack... when they're lying.

292
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:30,344
That's how you knew Karen
was telling the truth...

293
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:33,389
- when we first met her at the precinct.
- Yeah.

294
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:38,060
You listened to her heartbeat
without her permission?

295
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:41,688
We're lawyers! You can't do that!

296
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:45,276
There's a system in place, and
it's weird and invasive and...

297
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:50,114
Wait.

298
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:54,410
Are you telling me that
since I've known you,

299
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,329
any time I wasn't telling
the truth, you knew?

300
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:01,583
And what, you just played along?

301
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:04,795
Basically.

302
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:08,925
If you weren't half dead, I
would kick your ass, Murdock.

303
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,676
Am I lying about that?

304
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:12,929
No.

305
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:17,808
Was anything ever real with us?

306
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:21,603
Watch out, everybody! I'm
Blind Matt Murdock! Whoa!

307
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,982
Most... Most people
just say, "Matt Murdock."

308
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:26,943
I look like most people?

309
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,235
I don't know, I can't see you.

310
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,530
Well, at the moment,
that may be a blessing.

311
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,950
Oh, God, we should be studying.

312
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:37,828
You're gonna graduate summa cum laude,
you can take a night off, you nerd!

313
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:41,040
Yup, you'd be...

314
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:44,460
You'd be graduating with that, too,
if you took a few less nights off.

315
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,129
Point being, we are both one day gonna be

316
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:50,049
fine, upstanding members
of the legal profession.

317
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,219
El grande... How do you
say "lawyers" in Spanish?

318
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:56,305
Lawyers? Abogados.

319
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,975
El grande avocados!

320
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,185
That's not
Spanish, that's fruit.

321
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:04,188
- That's fruit.
- It's a vegetable at best.

322
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:08,150
See, that's what you get for taking
Punjabi instead of Spanish with me,

323
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,486
- just to chase a girl.
- What? No!

324
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:12,989
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:18,244
I'll have you know that Punjabi is
the future language of the future...

326
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,911
of business.

327
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:21,788
Couple years, we'll all be speaking it.

328
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:24,291
And she was so hot. She was so hot!

329
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,834
Yeah, say that in Punjabi.

330
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:32,216
- God! Shut up! Kiss my ass.
- You can't speak...

331
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,467
No! No, no, no, no.

332
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,427
Are you trying to tell me
that you didn't take Spanish

333
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,179
- to snuggle up to
what's-her-name... - What?

334
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,223
The Greek girl?

335
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:41,976
Well, I... surely I would take Greek?

336
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,772
No, because she was taking
Spanish. She already spoke Greek.

337
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:49,025
Whatever happened to her? She was smokin'.

338
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,318
Man, it didn't work out.

339
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:55,447
When does it ever with you,
buddy? How can I help you?

340
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:58,117
What are you
looking for, my young Padawan?

341
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,535
I don't know.

342
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,703
I guess just someone I
really like listening to.

343
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:05,957
- Where are those stairs?
- Stairs, here.

344
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,335
I would like to sit now.

345
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,754
Yes... we sit!

346
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:13,632
And then we forage for hamburgers

347
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:15,051
and more libations!

348
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:18,012
How about just the burgers?

349
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:19,763
Lightweight!

350
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:21,682
Hey, do you get the spins?

351
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,645
- Can you get those if you can't see?
- Yeah, I get the spins.

352
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:29,106
- Really?
- Yeah, it's...

353
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,108
It's an equilibrium
thing, it's not your eyes.

354
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:35,571
Liquid in your inner ear gets disturbed,
has trouble leveling off or something.

355
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:38,615
Huh.

356
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:42,328
That sucks. I thought you
might get a pass on that one.

357
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:44,538
No, it's even worse for me, I think.

358
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:46,873
'Cause my senses are so... Are...

359
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:48,792
Mmm.

360
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:51,503
- So what? Delicate?
- Hmm?

361
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:55,048
Yeah... you could say that.

362
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,302
Hey, how old were you when
you had your first drink?

363
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:00,929
- Nine.
- Nine?

364
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:03,349
Lush.

365
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,601
My dad gave me a sip from
this bottle of Scotch.

366
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,768
Go, Dad!

367
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,355
He didn't want my hands
shaking while I stitched him up.

368
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:13,734
He got cut pretty bad
over his eye. Boxing match.

369
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:15,111
He win?

370
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:17,779
No.

371
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:25,246
- He'd be proud of you, buddy.
- Thanks, man.

372
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:29,291
All he ever wanted was for me
to use my head, not my fists.

373
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,377
Not like him.

374
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,088
My mom wanted me to be a butcher.

375
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:38,550
I think she liked the idea of free ham.

376
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,887
Hey, they coming to
graduation? Your family?

377
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,722
The whole extended brood.

378
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:45,641
It's not every day a...

379
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,894
Nelson breaks from the ranks
of hardware and cured meats.

380
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:51,813
Franklin Nelson for
the defense, Your Honor.

381
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,275
Defense! I like that.
There's money in that.

382
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:56,067
Oh, come on. Is that all you care about?

383
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:57,986
No... No.

384
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,906
Truth and justice and all of that.

385
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:04,660
Couple of bucks?

386
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,371
Me and you, pal.

387
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:10,874
We're gonna have big,
fancy offices one day,

388
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:15,629
with steel and glass and chairs
you don't even know how to sit in.

389
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:18,382
Murdock and Nelson, attorneys at law!

390
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:21,302
Nelson and Murdock. Sounds better.

391
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:23,804
- You think?
- Yeah, trust me.

392
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:27,974
I can't see worth shit, but
my hearing's spectacular.

393
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,979
Me and you, pal... We're gonna do this.

394
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,193
We're gonna be the best damn
avocados this city has ever seen.

395
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:41,280
Best damn avocados.

396
00:24:42,155 --> 00:24:44,866
Let's get the hell out of here, come on.

397
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:49,746
You're strong.  I work out.

398
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:04,803
Hey... got a minute?

399
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:07,389
Yeah.

400
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:16,898
Caldwell says you, uh, handed
the fundraiser piece off to her.

401
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,736
I had something come up.
Going to be a problem?

402
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,489
I don't know. You tell me.

403
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:29,411
It's personal. You mind?

404
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,247
Just...

405
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,539
Just checking.

406
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,677
Haverson cornered me in
the bathroom this morning.

407
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:50,015
This something I'm gonna wanna hear?

408
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:54,811
Maybe. He's packing it
in, the end of the month.

409
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:58,148
Wants to spend quality time with
his grandkids or some such bullshit.

410
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:01,443
Metro could use you.

411
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:05,406
It's a good section.
No more running around.

412
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:07,032
I'm no editor.

413
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:08,700
I'm a reporter.

414
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:11,620
Yeah, well, that's what I
said. Now, look how fancy I am.

415
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,372
Like a damn peacock.

416
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:17,668
Well, I'm... I'm just saying...

417
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:19,670
be nice to keep the wheels on the wagon.

418
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:22,464
Get you a bump, better benefits.

419
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:25,551
You know, for whatever comes up.

420
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:28,345
I'll think about it.

421
00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:32,558
Okay...  you
know where to find me.

422
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:36,687
Hey.

423
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:40,566
Thanks.

424
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:43,610
Just let me know...

425
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:45,696
next couple of days, okay?

426
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,400
Foggy, it's me, again.

427
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:25,986
Call me back. Um, it's important.

428
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:46,840
- Shit!
- You're out of cream.

429
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,596
Uh, yeah, I know. It's,
um... It's on my, uh...

430
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,723
- How did you get in here?
- Front door.

431
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,099
You jimmied it?

432
00:27:56,182 --> 00:27:58,143
Unlocked.

433
00:27:58,226 --> 00:28:01,146
I keep telling you, you
got to be more careful.

434
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:03,356
I am.

435
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,609
No, I... I am.

436
00:28:07,528 --> 00:28:09,195
I was going to call you.

437
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,822
I was out getting lunch and
I thought, "What the hell,

438
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:13,659
I'll swing by the county clerk's
office and see what I can find."

439
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,452
You gonna ask about the box?

440
00:28:17,203 --> 00:28:18,204
Is that yours?

441
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:19,915
No, yours.

442
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,209
Go ahead. You've earned it.

443
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:35,681
What the hell is this?

444
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:38,266
Everything I have on the story.

445
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:42,270
And why are you giving it to me?

446
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,898
I used to be like you back in the day.

447
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,652
Good at turning heads,
getting people's attention.

448
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:50,361
Pissing them off.

449
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:53,449
And that's half of it.

450
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:57,035
But the other half...
is knowing when not to.

451
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:59,705
I thought that we were past this.

452
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:03,959
Do... Do I have to convince you
again just how important this is?

453
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,586
I know how important it is, Karen.

454
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:07,713
It's just not the most important.

455
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,675
Not to me... not right now.

456
00:29:11,758 --> 00:29:15,136
Well, then where is this coming
from? Did something happen?

457
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:24,813
- The extension didn't come through.
- Oh, Ben, I...

458
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:29,025
I'm sorry.

459
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,739
I made a few calls.

460
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,993
This place, I can't put her in here.

461
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,372
No.

462
00:29:42,456 --> 00:29:45,041
Gonna take some time
off and bring her home.

463
00:29:49,796 --> 00:29:51,006
Come take a ride with me.

464
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,675
Where?

465
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,348
There's, um... There's a nursing
home that I just heard about upstate.

466
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:03,894
Uh... I think it might change your mind.

467
00:30:04,978 --> 00:30:07,856
- Karen.
- No, just take a ride.

468
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,568
Come on. What could it hurt?

469
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,368
Okay.

470
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:32,380
You burned him alive?

471
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,465
Christ.

472
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,093
I never laid a hand on Nobu.

473
00:30:37,177 --> 00:30:40,305
So, you maneuvered that
masked idiot to take him out.

474
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:41,848
Same result.

475
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:46,144
- I need you to speak with Gao.
- Me?

476
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:48,772
The hell am I gonna say to her?

477
00:30:48,855 --> 00:30:52,233
Reassure her... everything is fine.

478
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,235
So, you want me to lie.

479
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,864
Mmm, you weren't particularly fond of Nobu.

480
00:30:57,948 --> 00:31:01,660
You thought he was unsettling, if I recall.

481
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:05,581
I think you're unsettling half
the time. See me lighting a match?

482
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,040
Wesley...

483
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,960
have the car brought around.

484
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,338
Let Vanessa know we're on our way.

485
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:14,965
Sir.

486
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,635
This is getting out of hand.

487
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:21,054
Ever since you started seeing that woman...

488
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:22,973
Leland.

489
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:26,977
- You have a son, yes?
- You know I do.

490
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:32,774
Which means at some point in the
past, I assume you met a woman...

491
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,568
fell in love.

492
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:37,738
- What does that have to do with this?
- Everything.

493
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:42,033
Gao is right. You've changed.

494
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:44,828
Change is inevitable...

495
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:49,457
for me... this city...

496
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:53,920
and certain relationships.

497
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:00,886
All right.

498
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,640
All right, I'll go speak with her.

499
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,434
I appreciate your support in the matter.

500
00:32:08,518 --> 00:32:10,228
Sure, why not?

501
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:12,689
We're all in this together, right?

502
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:16,860
What's left of us.

503
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:24,325
Yeah.

504
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,577
Yeah, okay. Thanks for reaching out.

505
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,296
- That was Brett.
- What'd he say?

506
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:39,758
You couldn't hear, with
your... super whatever?

507
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:43,428
It doesn't work like that.
I... I have to concentrate.

508
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:45,305
Focus on letting it in.

509
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:47,974
That junkie that killed Elena...

510
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:49,851
- they found him.
- Good.

511
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:53,271
Brett says he took a dive off the
roof, building he was shooting up in.

512
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:56,274
They had to sponge him off the sidewalk.

513
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:57,651
- No.
- Did you do that?

514
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:00,528
I told him to turn himself in.

515
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,114
I can't hear your heartbeat.
Are you telling me the truth?

516
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:04,615
I didn't kill him, Foggy.

517
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:08,161
It's Fisk, covering his ass.

518
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:11,665
So, you've never...
You've never gone that far?

519
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:12,749
No.

520
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,837
But I... I wanted to...

521
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,422
after Elena...

522
00:33:19,505 --> 00:33:21,466
after everything Fisk had done, I...

523
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:25,303
I went to a warehouse I thought he'd be at.

524
00:33:27,723 --> 00:33:29,891
I went to kill him.

525
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:33,061
It's not enough playing judge and jury?

526
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,188
You gotta add executioner to the list?

527
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:37,190
I didn't think I had a choice.

528
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:41,277
What happened to all that talk about
going after him through the system?

529
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:43,238
Making the law work for us?

530
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,950
Sometimes the law isn't enough.

531
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:49,369
As you can
see in the countersuit,

532
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:52,748
not only does my client
Roxxon Energy Corporation

533
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:57,002
categorically deny any
culpability in your diagnosis,

534
00:33:57,085 --> 00:34:00,671
but also cites clear and
actionable breach of contract

535
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:02,799
regarding your decision to share details

536
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:06,928
of your highly sensitive
work in the Londonderry plant.

537
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:11,933
And while my client is, uh...
sympathetic towards your condition,

538
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,560
Roxxon must vigorously defend its patents

539
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:17,522
in relation to the extraction
and refinement process

540
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:20,483
that you, by admission,
had intimate knowledge of.

541
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:23,319
In light of this, we
will be pursuing damages.

542
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:24,946
Damages?

543
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,491
You released sensitive
information regarding...

544
00:34:28,574 --> 00:34:31,369
The only person I ever told
anything to was my doctor.

545
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:37,000
So that he could try to figure
out what was wrong with me.

546
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,961
I didn't release anything.

547
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:47,302
Give us a minute.

548
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:54,350
- Hey.
- Hey.

549
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:56,186
I just bumped into Morales.

550
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:57,270
Guess what he heard?

551
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:58,729
They're gonna offer us the job.

552
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:00,816
No more interning in a broom closet.

553
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:05,195
We're each going to have our own
office with a view of... something.

554
00:35:05,278 --> 00:35:06,529
We did it, buddy!

555
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:08,949
Glass and steel at Landman
and mother-effin' Zack...

556
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:10,784
Why do you have that look on your face?

557
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:11,993
Oh.

558
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:13,703
- What look? I...
- You know what look.

559
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:15,371
I've been reading Thurgood Marshall.

560
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:17,290
Oh, shit, not Marshall.

561
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:19,918
"We must dissent from the indifference.
We must dissent from the apathy.

562
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,088
- We must dissent from..."
- "From the fear." Yeah, I know.

563
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:24,755
You've read it a million times.

564
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,757
You think what happened
in there today was right?

565
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:28,509
No, Matt, I don't think it was right.

566
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,262
But according to the law, if
he did disclose trade secrets

567
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:33,264
- to a third party other than his doctor...
- He didn't.

568
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,724
How the hell do you know?

569
00:35:34,808 --> 00:35:36,852
'Cause I... I have a feeling.

570
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,396
Last time I checked,
those are inadmissible.

571
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,358
Is this what you want...
to be a part of that?

572
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,776
Protecting corporations
from people that need help?

573
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:46,945
It doesn't have to be like that.

574
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:49,072
We get a toehold, make partner...

575
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:51,157
And then in 10, 15 years, we what?

576
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:53,576
Change the system from the inside?

577
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,954
On our way to work in our Bentleys?

578
00:35:56,037 --> 00:36:00,666
You know how many of the other interns
would kill for a real spot here?

579
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,919
Murder us in our sleep
without a second thought.

580
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:05,671
Well, then maybe those aren't the kind
of people we should be working with.

581
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:15,223
Foggy?

582
00:36:16,432 --> 00:36:18,018
What are you doing?

583
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:19,685
Well...

584
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:23,606
I'm gonna steal as many bagels
as I can fit in this box.

585
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:24,732
With you as my partner,

586
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,193
there's no telling when I'll be
able to afford a real meal again.

587
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,656
We will get by.

588
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,202
Come on, Mother Teresa,
let's go save the world.

589
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:37,745
Hey.

590
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:48,464
You want to say something.

591
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:50,258
Really don't.

592
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,139
Your breathing changes
when you're about to.

593
00:36:56,932 --> 00:36:58,349
Now you're just showing off.

594
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,937
Say what you need to say.

595
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:18,369
Why didn't you tell me it was that serious?

596
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:24,584
Saying it means it's true.

597
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:32,550
She has her good moments.
Lucid ones, you know?

598
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:36,012
And she's sharp... and strong.

599
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,514
More than me.

600
00:37:39,515 --> 00:37:41,434
But she always was.

601
00:37:45,188 --> 00:37:47,065
She was always...

602
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,154
I'm sorry, Ben.

603
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:56,407
Yeah.

604
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:01,121
There's nothing worse...

605
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:04,790
feeling choices are made for us.

606
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:08,628
There's nothing you
can do, but swim in shit

607
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:11,631
and hope you don't get
too much in your mouth.

608
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,344
She'd like you.

609
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,807
Should've taken you
around to meet her, but...

610
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,894
Yeah.

611
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:30,525
You know, we all have things
we hold onto for ourselves...

612
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:34,154
that we don't want anyone to know.

613
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,532
But there's always someone who does...

614
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,327
sooner or later.

615
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,588
Admissions
is on another tour.

616
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,757
Shouldn't be too long.

617
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,092
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

618
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:05,601
What are we doing here?

619
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:10,273
I can't afford this place.
This is a waste of time.

620
00:39:13,026 --> 00:39:15,278
Let's just take a look around.

621
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:17,572
Maybe it'll be worth the drive.

622
00:39:23,078 --> 00:39:25,871
You run around dressed like
a moron, beating people up!

623
00:39:25,955 --> 00:39:28,874
- It's not that simple and you know it.
- No, I don't know shit.

624
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:32,170
Not about this. I mean, how...

625
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:34,422
Okay, so you get these
whatever-you-call-thems

626
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,548
when you're a kid.

627
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:37,758
How do you go from that
to what you're doing now?

628
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,430
When I was a kid, before the accident...

629
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:46,392
I'd lay awake at night
listening to the sirens.

630
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:49,104
I liked to put stories to them.

631
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:52,148
Trying to figure out what they were
for, ambulance or cops, robbery or fire.

632
00:39:52,232 --> 00:39:53,899
I don't know, just a stupid game.

633
00:39:55,068 --> 00:39:58,821
But after I lost my sight,
after my abilities developed,

634
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:01,699
I realized how many sirens
there actually were...

635
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:05,161
how much this city
suffered every single night.

636
00:40:05,245 --> 00:40:07,663
You've been running around
doing this since you were a kid?

637
00:40:07,747 --> 00:40:10,416
No. I... I tried not to fight...

638
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,253
to make my dad proud.
To... to block it out.

639
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:19,092
The sirens, the pain, the fear,
all... strangling Hell's Kitchen.

640
00:40:19,175 --> 00:40:22,137
For years, I buried my
head and turned away.

641
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,430
Then one night...

642
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:27,808
right after we quit Landman and Zack...

643
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:31,812
- I heard it.
- Heard what?

644
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:34,607
A little girl...

645
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,110
crying in her bed, in a
building down the block.

646
00:40:37,193 --> 00:40:40,863
Her father liked to go to
her room late at night...

647
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:42,448
when his wife was asleep.

648
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:44,700
Oh, Jesus.

649
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,163
I called Child Services...

650
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:50,498
like you're supposed to.

651
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,626
But the mom, she wouldn't believe it.

652
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:57,338
Said it wasn't true. And
the dad, he was smart.

653
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:02,843
He made sure what he did, how
he did it, didn't leave a mark.

654
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,806
The law couldn't do anything
to help that little girl.

655
00:41:07,557 --> 00:41:08,558
But I could.

656
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:12,603
I knew his routine.

657
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:16,399
Waited till he was alone.

658
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:53,644
You touch your daughter
again, and I will know.

659
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:32,558
He spent the next month in a
hospital, eating through a straw.

660
00:42:33,476 --> 00:42:35,185
And I never slept better.

661
00:42:36,396 --> 00:42:38,314
You say all this, like...

662
00:42:40,275 --> 00:42:42,985
one day you'd just had
it with how things are.

663
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,030
But to do what you do...

664
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:50,451
you had to keep training, all
those years since that Stick guy,

665
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,995
knowing you would do something like this.

666
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:56,749
Maybe it isn't only about justice, Matt.

667
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:59,669
Maybe it's about you having
an excuse to hit someone.

668
00:42:59,752 --> 00:43:01,962
Maybe you just can't stop yourself.

669
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:05,215
I don't want to stop.

670
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:17,895
You're very pretty.

671
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,398
Thank you.

672
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,277
Looks like you've got yourself an admirer.

673
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,740
All the people here,

674
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:33,994
all the years that they've lived,
there must be so many stories.

675
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:37,498
Only thing we have,
everything said and done.

676
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:42,002
No buildings named after us,
fancy inheritances to leave behind,

677
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:48,050
just... the stories those who were
close to us tell to keep us alive.

678
00:43:49,344 --> 00:43:51,512
Even if it's just in memory.

679
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:56,517
Well, maybe that's enough.

680
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:06,193
Hey, um, why don't we talk to
somebody that actually lives here?

681
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,445
See what it's really like.

682
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:09,238
All right, let's get a...

683
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:13,242
- Let's get an attendant or somebody.
- Or we could just knock.

684
00:44:15,035 --> 00:44:16,036
See?

685
00:44:16,912 --> 00:44:18,414
- Karen.
- Come in.

686
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:21,417
She said, "Come in."

687
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:36,807
Is it time?

688
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:41,228
- Time for what?
- You know what.

689
00:44:43,272 --> 00:44:46,191
You bring it before I
go to bed every night.

690
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:48,277
Oh.

691
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:51,280
- I don't know you, do I?
- Oh...

692
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:55,660
Uh, no. We... uh, we just...

693
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:58,913
We wanted to ask you some questions.

694
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:02,833
About how you like it at Saint Benezet.

695
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:06,336
- It's very nice, isn't it?
- It is.

696
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:10,007
- How long have you been here?
- A while now.

697
00:45:11,426 --> 00:45:13,135
Ever since my husband passed.

698
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:16,138
Are you two married?

699
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:19,224
No.

700
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:23,103
- Well, I am, but not to her.
- No, I'm single.

701
00:45:24,772 --> 00:45:26,441
Uh, Mrs. Vistain...

702
00:45:27,066 --> 00:45:28,609
Is it time?

703
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:30,319
Uh...

704
00:45:30,402 --> 00:45:31,654
We're sorry to bother you, ma'am.

705
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:33,030
We should go.

706
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:36,408
Mrs. Vistain, um, your husband...

707
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:39,829
- Was that your first marriage?
- Arthur?

708
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,291
Lord, no, he was my third.

709
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:47,252
Kept his name, thought
it sounded like royalty.

710
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:49,129
I always loved that.

711
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:51,841
Martin was my second.

712
00:45:51,924 --> 00:45:54,885
Such a beautiful man.

713
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:56,471
But confused...

714
00:45:57,847 --> 00:45:59,223
by other men.

715
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:02,017
Oh, um...

716
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:04,729
Your first marriage... who was that to?

717
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:11,068
He tried so hard, but...
he drank, you know.

718
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,863
I didn't.

719
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,033
Never touched a drop. Not once, no.

720
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,749
And, uh... did you have any
children with your first husband?

721
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:27,585
- Karen...
- Just... let her answer.

722
00:46:28,628 --> 00:46:29,837
Mrs. Vistain?

723
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:32,214
He's such a good boy.

724
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,219
Comes to see me every weekend.

725
00:46:39,138 --> 00:46:40,973
He's gentle, sweet.

726
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:45,227
Not like his father.

727
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,480
And what's his name? Your son?

728
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:52,610
Wilson.

729
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:54,444
Fisk?

730
00:46:58,157 --> 00:46:59,534
Wilson Fisk?

731
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:02,828
I haven't used that name since...

732
00:47:03,996 --> 00:47:05,748
It wasn't his fault.

733
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,794
His father, he was...

734
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:14,632
Wilson... just wanted him to stop.

735
00:47:15,925 --> 00:47:17,885
It wasn't his fault, what he did.

736
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:21,764
Mrs. Vistain, what did your son do?

737
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:30,064
There are those that question
why a man such as myself,

738
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,401
a man who treasures his privacy,

739
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:39,156
would willingly subject
himself to the public eye.

740
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:46,371
I question the man who
wouldn't step forward

741
00:47:46,455 --> 00:47:51,752
when his city, his heart,
is in such a time of need.

742
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:52,962
With your help...

743
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:57,007
we can ensure that everyone...

744
00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:00,427
that was affected by the recent attacks,

745
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,640
and all who call Hell's Kitchen their home,

746
00:48:04,724 --> 00:48:07,309
will see a brighter day.

747
00:48:07,392 --> 00:48:11,063
I thank you, and please enjoy your evening.

748
00:48:20,615 --> 00:48:22,700
That was beautiful.

749
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,494
That word is meant for only you tonight.

750
00:48:29,665 --> 00:48:32,668
- Thank you for coming. Thank you so much.
- Of course, thank you.

751
00:48:32,752 --> 00:48:34,336
- It's a pleasure to see you again.
- Nice to see you.

752
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:38,340
Thank you so much for the donation.

753
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:40,635
It means the world to me,
and to my organization.

754
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:41,802
Yeah, mmm-hmm.

755
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:49,935
I haven't been in a room with so many
deep pockets since the junk bond days.

756
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:52,730
Leland, I was starting to worry.

757
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:54,481
It's taken care of.

758
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,233
Appreciate it.

759
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:57,735
Yeah, great.

760
00:48:57,818 --> 00:49:01,321
So, does anybody need
a drink as bad as I do?

761
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,948
Yes, please.

762
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:07,787
It was a hell of a speech, Fisk. You
ever think about running for office?

763
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,164
I'll leave that to
people like you, Senator.

764
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,124
That's a good answer.

765
00:49:12,207 --> 00:49:15,335
You, um... got a minute to
talk about that zoning issue?

766
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:16,796
Yes, of course.

767
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:20,007
I'll be back in a minute.

768
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:25,721
I didn't vote for Senator
Cherryh last election.

769
00:49:25,805 --> 00:49:27,014
Thank you so much.

770
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,849
Few people did.

771
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:30,600
But he still won.

772
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:33,353
He said it was because of the
advice he got from Van Lunt

773
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:37,149
and his crackpot astrologer,
if you can believe that.

774
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:38,984
Van Lunt?

775
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:42,279
Yeah, he's the guy who...
owns this mausoleum.

776
00:49:42,362 --> 00:49:47,910
Ask me, has more to do with Cherryh
having his fingers in all the right holes.

777
00:49:52,581 --> 00:49:53,874
Somebody can't hold his liquor.

778
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:57,962
What the hell is this?

779
00:50:03,926 --> 00:50:06,846
Wesley, get the car.
We need to leave... now.

780
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:11,058
Vanessa!

781
00:50:13,602 --> 00:50:16,521
Christ! Somebody
get a doctor here!

782
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:17,898
Somebody get a doctor!

783
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,567
Vanessa?

784
00:50:27,032 --> 00:50:28,533
Vanessa!

785
00:50:31,453 --> 00:50:32,662
Vanessa!

786
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:42,131
You're going to get yourself
killed, you keep this up.

787
00:50:42,214 --> 00:50:43,758
You know that, right?

788
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,136
I can take care of myself.

789
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,139
What about the rest of us?

790
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,558
Me, Karen...

791
00:50:53,642 --> 00:50:56,436
we're a part of this now, because of you.

792
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,397
And we didn't get a say in that.

793
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,817
What do you think's gonna
happen if I give up now, Foggy?

794
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:05,112
- Who's going to stop Fisk?
- Oh, I don't know... the law?

795
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,696
Tell that to Elena.

796
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:13,037
If you could have put on a mask and
prevented what happened to her...

797
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,873
- you telling me you wouldn't have?
- It's not fair, Matt.

798
00:51:15,956 --> 00:51:17,707
We don't live in a world that's fair.

799
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:19,584
We live in this one.

800
00:51:19,668 --> 00:51:22,421
And I'm doing everything I
can to make it a better place.

801
00:51:22,504 --> 00:51:24,048
"A better place."

802
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,345
That kind of sounds like
what Fisk keeps saying.

803
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:32,139
Don't say that. Don't twist it around.

804
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:35,893
You tried to kill him,
Matt. You told me yourself.

805
00:51:35,976 --> 00:51:38,938
How is that any different than
the way he solves his problems?

806
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:41,356
I made a mistake. I know that.

807
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:44,902
Misspelling "Hanukkah" is a mistake.

808
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,322
Attempted murder is a
little something else.

809
00:51:49,114 --> 00:51:53,327
You ever stop to think what would
happen if you went to jail? Or worse?

810
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,164
You really think that anyone would believe
that I didn't know what you were doing?

811
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,458
That Karen didn't know?

812
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:02,837
This city needs me in that mask, Foggy.

813
00:52:03,795 --> 00:52:04,880
Maybe you're right.

814
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,843
Maybe it does.

815
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:11,261
But I don't.

816
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:15,891
I only ever needed my friend.

817
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:22,356
I wouldn't have kept this
from you, Matt. Not from you.

818
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:25,234
You don't know that. You don't know that.

819
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:28,653
Yeah, I do.

820
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:35,202
Foggy... wait.

821
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:37,496
Foggy.

822
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:51,886
I worry about
you, it's all I'm saying.

823
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:54,889
- Foggy, I'm fine.
- Don't look fine.

824
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:56,390
See, Josie's worried about you too.

825
00:52:56,473 --> 00:53:00,394
- I wouldn't go that far.
- Gotta be more careful.

826
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,187
I know. I know.

827
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:05,065
Tripping and falling taking out the trash.

828
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:07,276
You got to get someone to do that for you.

829
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,778
Come on, I just need to be
more careful, like you said.

830
00:53:11,363 --> 00:53:12,864
Done!

831
00:53:12,948 --> 00:53:15,867
Run your feelers over this little beauty.

832
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:17,577
What is it, a napkin?

833
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,622
No, my friend, this is our future.

834
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:24,001
- Huh, feels like a napkin.
- It's a drawing of a sign.

835
00:53:24,793 --> 00:53:27,796
"Nelson and Murdock, Attorneys At Law."

836
00:53:30,424 --> 00:53:33,593
You, uh... You really want to do this?

837
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:37,056
No, I'm pissing my pants. There
is actual urine in my trousers.

838
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,810
But I trust you.

839
00:53:41,893 --> 00:53:44,313
You think this is what
we should be doing...

840
00:53:44,396 --> 00:53:45,564
then I'm with you.

841
00:53:46,606 --> 00:53:47,774
For better or worse.

842
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,235
Sounds like we're getting married.

843
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,821
This is way more important
than a civil union!

844
00:53:52,904 --> 00:53:54,781
Come on, we're gonna be business partners.

845
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,408
We're gonna share
everything with each other.

846
00:53:56,491 --> 00:54:00,287
Our thoughts, our dreams,
bills, crushing debt...

847
00:54:01,997 --> 00:54:05,584
There is no one I'd rather be
doing this with, buddy. Seriously.

848
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:07,294
Me, too, pal.

849
00:54:08,253 --> 00:54:11,923
Now raise your damn glass, 'cause
I'm gonna clink the hell out of it.

850
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:15,052
Nelson and Murdock, Attorneys at Law.

851
00:54:15,135 --> 00:54:16,886
Nelson and Murdock.
