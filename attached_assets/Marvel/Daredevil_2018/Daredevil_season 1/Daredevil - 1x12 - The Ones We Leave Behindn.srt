1
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:55,022
It's a difficult thing, isn't it?

2
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:56,857
Taking a life...

3
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,445
feeling of the weight and responsibility

4
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:04,407
of all the years the person
you've murdered has lived...

5
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:07,325
moments that they've cherished...

6
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:12,039
the dreams that they've
struggled towards, gone...

7
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,752
because of you.

8
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:22,090
I want you to know something.

9
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:26,512
Something important that I've learned.

10
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,599
That it gets easier...

11
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,603
the more you do it.

12
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:40,312
- Jesus.
- It's okay, it's just me...

13
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:42,355
the dick.

14
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,357
What are you doing here?

15
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,443
Last I checked, it was my office.

16
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:47,778
Yeah, yours and Matt's.

17
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,990
Is that why you're creeping
around so late, to avoid him?

18
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:53,408
Okay, first, there was no creep.

19
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:56,161
You were just too whatever
you were looking out the window

20
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:59,122
to realize I stepped out of my office.

21
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:01,208
And have you been hitting the juice?

22
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,876
Because you kind of
smell like a distillery.

23
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,961
You're one to talk.

24
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:07,130
I found you practically curled
up under the bar at Josie's.

25
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:08,215
Fair enough.

26
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:11,176
But that was the end of my night.
What happened to you after that?

27
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:13,428
Nothing.

28
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:17,057
That nothing include drinking
and dancing? Or just the drinking?

29
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,184
Funny, you actually sound like you care.

30
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:22,395
Karen, what's going on with me and Matt...

31
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,648
it sucks that it's bleeding over to you.

32
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,524
It's the last thing
I'd ever want to happen.

33
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:29,402
I know.

34
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,947
Sorry, just, I, uh...

35
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,369
Just had a... a rough night.

36
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:40,623
- You and I should not drink.
- Yeah.

37
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:43,208
Yeah, I'm thinking about giving
it up, moving on to the hard stuff.

38
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,419
Narcotics? Deal me in.

39
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:49,506
- You don't seem like the type.
- Yeah, I smoked a doobie once.

40
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:50,883
Made me drool.

41
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:53,886
- A doobie...
- Weed, pot, the Mary Jane.

42
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,929
Whatever the kids are
calling it these days.

43
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:58,932
I'm not sure that's, uh,
considered hard anymore.

44
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:00,976
At least, not according to Denver, anyway.

45
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:03,436
The times they are a-changin'.

46
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:06,982
Yeah.

47
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:09,985
Yeah.

48
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,989
So, you coming back to the office?

49
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,118
I just needed to pick up a few things.

50
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:21,413
Wait, Foggy.

51
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:24,332
Let's not do this right
now. It's not a good time.

52
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,583
Is it ever gonna be?

53
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:27,628
I don't know.

54
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:29,004
That's not really an answer.

55
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:31,506
Best one I got.

56
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,385
Whatever's going on between you and Matt,

57
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:38,889
it would be really nice not
to be alone here, you know?

58
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:42,517
I know. What you said
last night, you were right.

59
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,687
No matter what's going
on between me and Matt...

60
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,980
that doesn't change anything with Fisk.

61
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:48,273
I'm gonna keep digging.

62
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:51,819
You can't just run around killing
people and call yourself a human being.

63
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:55,698
He's gonna pay for what he's
done, just like you said.

64
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:58,909
Do we still have a copy of all
that stuff Ben gave us, from the...

65
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,954
the man in the mask?

66
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:06,499
Yeah, uh, I think so.

67
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,586
What are you gonna do with it?

68
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,339
Honestly, I have no idea.

69
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:18,887
So, you, uh... you don't think
the Mask is a terrorist anymore?

70
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:22,933
I don't understand what he is.

71
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:26,436
But no, I don't think he's a terrorist.

72
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,481
It's a start, I guess.

73
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:33,568
Look, I know things are... weird.

74
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:36,404
But I'm still around.

75
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:38,406
You need me, just call.

76
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:43,286
- You gonna pick up this time?
- Yeah, I'll pick up.

77
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:48,291
Might not seem like it, but
everything's gonna be all right.

78
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,711
How can you be sure?

79
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:52,880
Because I have to be.

80
00:08:54,757 --> 00:08:58,301
Ease off the booze, stay
away from the Mary Jane.

81
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:01,263
Will do.

82
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,453
Well, that wasn't awkward.

83
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:29,833
What are you doing here so late?

84
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,629
- Or early or whatever it is?
- Um...

85
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:37,674
couldn't sleep.

86
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,011
Lot of that going around.

87
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,890
Seems like it's the only thing
we still all have in common.

88
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,268
I'm sorry, Karen.

89
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:50,395
For which part?

90
00:09:53,148 --> 00:09:55,067
All of it, pretty much.

91
00:09:58,028 --> 00:09:59,112
You want coffee?

92
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:01,656
Yeah, please.

93
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,838
You know, he thinks he got her killed...

94
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:17,505
Elena.

95
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:18,631
He didn't.

96
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:21,134
You wanna try telling him that?

97
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:24,637
Oh, right, that...

98
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:27,015
that would be if you two were
still speaking to each other.

99
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:29,267
It's his choice.

100
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,981
Only if you let it be.

101
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:48,829
You know, I'm starting to
feel like I made a mistake...

102
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:50,663
coming to work here.

103
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:53,959
- Do you want to leave?
- No.

104
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,795
This is my home.

105
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:02,634
You and Foggy, you're the only
good things in my life right now.

106
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,220
Karen, did something happen?

107
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,352
Yes.

108
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,777
The world fell apart.

109
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,447
Didn't you notice?

110
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,265
Wilson?

111
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:52,767
You...

112
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:57,397
Don't speak.
I'll get the doctor.

113
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,233
Why... why am...

114
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:02,319
why am I here?

115
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:07,074
It was the benefit.

116
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:10,118
Something was in your drink.

117
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:11,911
But it was my fault.

118
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:14,539
I should have known, the way things are,

119
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:16,833
that someone would try to get to me.

120
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:21,213
And I'm sorry. You were
caught in the middle.

121
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:27,510
Someone tries to kill
you and you're the one apologizing?

122
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:32,349
You almost died, Vanessa, because of me...

123
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,768
because of who I am.

124
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:37,645
I made arrangements.

125
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:40,357
When you're able to be moved, you'll be...

126
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,611
taken out of the country.

127
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,198
Are you coming with me?

128
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,911
Then...

129
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:57,332
I think I'll stay where I am.

130
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,086
I need to keep you safe.

131
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:05,257
Is that really all you need?

132
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,092
I was being selfish...

133
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:10,762
believing that I could have this...

134
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:13,681
that there would be no consequences.

135
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:16,143
I knew being with you would be...

136
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:19,646
complicated.

137
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:22,774
I made that choice.

138
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,194
One I still make.

139
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:33,576
Find who did this to us
and make them understand.

140
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,828
Understand what?

141
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:40,208
That they could never
take you away from me.

142
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:44,796
- Sir?
- Not now.

143
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,175
Go. Go.

144
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:50,510
- No, it can wait.
- I'm still here.

145
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:53,930
I'm not leaving.

146
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,434
I'll make them suffer
for what they've done.

147
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:00,687
I expect nothing less.

148
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,740
- Sorry, sir.
- What is it?

149
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,118
They've located him.

150
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:18,163
And where is he?

151
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:23,585
Sir, excuse me, stop.
I can't let you go in...

152
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:27,047
Get your hands
off me, moron. He called me.

153
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:31,384
Oh, shit.

154
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,138
Look what they did, Leland.

155
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,807
Look what they did to him.

156
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,976
What happened?

157
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,813
He got a call last night at the hospital.

158
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:46,399
- From who?
- I don't know.

159
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:49,069
He asked for the keys
to the SUV and my gun.

160
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,197
And you let him leave?

161
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:54,324
Alone?

162
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,662
He ordered me to stay.

163
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:02,457
He wanted as many men on you as possible.

164
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:10,132
Whoa, Wilson!

165
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:13,885
- Wilson!
- He's my friend!

166
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:16,012
He's... my... friend!

167
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:20,225
May... maybe this isn't the best
time to be beating your men to death.

168
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:23,645
He... he did what he was told.

169
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:26,231
I think they call that
loyalty, or something.

170
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:45,375
Clean him up.

171
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,309
First, the attack
at the benefit, now this?

172
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:06,229
Somebody's not happy.

173
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:09,607
Nobu's accounts... are they still active?

174
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:13,736
Yeah, but nothing's been touched
since he went up in smoke.

175
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,157
- And Gao?
- You think this is her?

176
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,327
No, my money's on the Japanese.

177
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:25,081
Maybe they found out about your
little bonfire with their boss.

178
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,711
You can go now, Leland.

179
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:30,920
Okay.

180
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:37,177
But... whatever war you're
thinking about starting...

181
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:40,388
don't lose sight of the end game.

182
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:44,851
Once Senator Cherryh has cleared
the last of the zoning issues,

183
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,936
you can tear down the
rest of Hell's Kitchen

184
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,022
and build your better tomorrow.

185
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:56,613
It's a shame not everybody'll
be there to see it, but...

186
00:16:58,448 --> 00:16:59,616
shit happens.

187
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,997
Find out who did this to...

188
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,042
to Vanessa and to Wesley.

189
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:11,961
I'll see what I can shake loose.

190
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:14,881
Just remember, uh...

191
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:20,595
wind blows the hardest the
closer you get to the mountaintop.

192
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:30,457
You like making an entrance, don't you?

193
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:36,379
- I need information.
- Yeah?

194
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:39,757
Haven't heard anything about a man
in a mask beating on bad guys lately.

195
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,175
Thought maybe you'd quit on us.

196
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:43,386
I'm still here.

197
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:47,098
Somebody get a piece of you?

198
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,851
We went the distance,
it's all that matters.

199
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:52,895
"Went the distance,"
huh? Sound like a boxer.

200
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:55,272
Always a reporter.

201
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,317
Hey, it's what I do.

202
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,320
Why I'm here.

203
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:03,365
Yeah, I've seen this around...

204
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:05,617
all over the city.

205
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,411
Heroin, pure like you've never seen.

206
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:11,456
Call it "Steel Serpent" on the streets.

207
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,916
The man I took that off
of murdered Elena Cardenas.

208
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,001
Yeah, I heard about that.

209
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,336
He was working for Fisk.

210
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,170
Vladimir Ranskahov, before he died,

211
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:20,673
he said Fisk arranged access
to the Chinese and their drugs.

212
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:24,135
- Russians got wiped out.
- I'm not interested in the Russians.

213
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:26,429
You're thinking about making
a move on the triads now?

214
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:28,515
- Russians were distribution, right?
- That's what I hear.

215
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:31,142
With them out the way, there's an
awful lot of money lying on the table.

216
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:33,060
You think Fisk picked up distribution?

217
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,938
Like I said, a lot of money.

218
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:39,567
And I'm guessing tearing down
Hell's Kitchen isn't cheap.

219
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,904
Interrupting the cash
flow may... slow him down.

220
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:44,697
Doubt if it'll stop him.

221
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:45,907
No...

222
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:49,411
but it might knock him off balance.

223
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:53,122
Get him mad, maybe enough to make
a mistake big enough to matter.

224
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:59,003
I got something I'm working on, might
help push that bald prick over the edge.

225
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:02,674
No, I want you to keep your
head down, until this is over.

226
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:04,884
My head's fine where it's at.

227
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:06,260
Oh, yeah?

228
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:08,471
Vladimir's brother
probably thought the same.

229
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:12,684
Point taken.

230
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,061
The Chinese, who's the man at the top?

231
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:18,314
Isn't one, it's a woman.
Never got her name.

232
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:22,026
- Any idea where I can find her?
- If I did, it'd be on the front page.

233
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:24,696
The Russian that Blake
shot in interrogation,

234
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,490
there was a Chinese man in the
back of his cab in an alley.

235
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:28,866
Blind, carried a backpack.

236
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,495
I've seen those guys around
town. Drugs in the pack?

237
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:34,789
Little busy to check.

238
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:39,544
Would make sense. Nobody'd
look at a blind man twice.

239
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,422
No, they wouldn't.

240
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,842
You said you've seen them around.

241
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:47,051
Where?

242
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,178
51st and 9th.

243
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:50,680
No...

244
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:52,599
10th. 51st and 10th.

245
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:54,391
But that was a while back.

246
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:56,352
I'll see what I can find.

247
00:20:56,436 --> 00:20:58,730
It was during the day, morning rush hour.

248
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:02,399
- Guy like you might stick out.
- I'll dress down.

249
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,820
It's cold, you should get
yourself a better coat.

250
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:08,322
How about you get yourself a better outfit,

251
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,700
you gonna keep running around out there?

252
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,868
I'm working on it.

253
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:15,622
Watch your back, Ben.

254
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:19,166
Fisk is an animal... and we're
backing him into a corner.

255
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:32,096
Hey, sorry. Couldn't flag a cab.

256
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:35,391
You know that buffalo wouldn't
make me a vodka martini?

257
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:38,019
I had to settle for
just vodka.  Hmm.

258
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:41,188
Oh, yeah, she can be,
um... You gotta ask nice.

259
00:21:41,272 --> 00:21:43,483
I pay nice.
That should be enough.

260
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:45,276
You want a martini? I'll get you a martini.

261
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,404
What I want is to not be in this petri
dish a second longer than I have to.

262
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:49,781
Why are we meeting here?

263
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:53,576
I need your help.

264
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,327
My help?

265
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:56,538
Yeah.

266
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,832
That's disappointing, I
thought this was a booty call.

267
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,546
You remember the tenement case, that
I came to Landman and Zack about?

268
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:05,922
Yeah, Mrs. Cardenas.

269
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:08,424
Thought you were gonna
say "Carnitas" again.

270
00:22:08,508 --> 00:22:11,427
I'm not a complete asshole. I
heard about what happened to her.

271
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:13,054
Yeah, but that's only half the story.

272
00:22:13,137 --> 00:22:15,264
Her tenement was just one
building that was targeted.

273
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:17,684
There's dozens of others across
Hell's Kitchen, maybe hundreds.

274
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,476
Targeted by who?

275
00:22:21,604 --> 00:22:22,689
Wilson Fisk.

276
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:26,651
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Wait, just wait a second.

277
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:28,903
We represent Fisk. I can't
talk to you about this.

278
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:30,738
Then don't talk, just...

279
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:35,326
read.

280
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,662
Five minutes, please.

281
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:39,914
Five minutes.

282
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:42,124
And only because you were actually
really good the other night.

283
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:54,804
Everybody's gotta be
sneaking around tonight?

284
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:56,180
What the hell are you doing?

285
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:58,641
Why haven't you published the story
about what Fisk did to his father?

286
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:01,518
- I told you, I'd think about it.
- It needs to be out there, Ben.

287
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:02,937
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

288
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,689
I think they know...

289
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:08,109
that we found his mother.

290
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:12,989
I think they know, Ben.

291
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,201
Been trying to find a second source.

292
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:20,747
There's a guy... who knew
Rigoletto back in the day...

293
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:23,791
relocated to Florida.

294
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,835
Just waiting to hear back.

295
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:29,839
What does that have to do with...
It isn't about who he owed money to.

296
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,048
It's a connection.

297
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:34,176
Bill Fisk owed money to Rigoletto.

298
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,512
My source remembers anything about that,

299
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:39,015
it's a piece of her story we can prove.

300
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:40,099
From there...

301
00:23:40,182 --> 00:23:43,645
There isn't going to be a "from there"
if we don't do something... right now.

302
00:23:43,728 --> 00:23:45,772
I work for a newspaper, Karen.

303
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:49,566
Not some Internet blog where the
facts are whatever you make up.

304
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:50,943
Yeah.

305
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:02,121
You said you think they might know
that we went out to Saint Benezet.

306
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:03,372
How?

307
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,459
It's just a feeling.

308
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:12,965
Yeah, had plenty of those over the years.

309
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:15,051
Sometimes they were right, sometimes not.

310
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:18,512
No, you have to trust me on this, Ben.

311
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:21,265
We need that story out
there before it is too late.

312
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:24,727
Could always... post
it yourself on the Net.

313
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:27,021
Don't need me.

314
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:30,316
And who'll believe me
when they start digging?

315
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:31,859
When they find...

316
00:24:33,903 --> 00:24:35,446
what you found...

317
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:38,783
when you were looking into me.

318
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,002
I'll see if I can shake
loose any other sources.

319
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:53,715
Write up what I've got
tomorrow, give it to my editor.

320
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:55,132
See what happens.

321
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:58,803
Thank you. Thank you.

322
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:04,641
That was longer than five minutes.

323
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:06,143
Where did you get all this?

324
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:09,856
Some of it Matt and I turned
up working the tenement case.

325
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:11,273
And the rest of it?

326
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:15,319
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

327
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:19,115
You're working with that prick
that blew up half the city?

328
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:20,783
You read what's in there. He didn't do it.

329
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,326
It was your client.

330
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:25,454
My client has been all over the
news trying to help this city.

331
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:28,958
So, there's nothing that's been
going on at Landman and Zack?

332
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,878
Nothing that doesn't feel right with Fisk?

333
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:38,801
Fisk is one of our most billable clients,
along with Owlsley at Silver and Brent.

334
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:41,345
You know, I could lose
my job just sitting here.

335
00:25:41,428 --> 00:25:43,097
Maybe even get disbarred.

336
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,474
You didn't answer the question.

337
00:25:47,268 --> 00:25:48,435
Remember what I said

338
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,980
when I came in into Landman
and Zack to discuss the case?

339
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,608
About how you used to have a soul?

340
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:57,987
That wasn't just a jab, Marci.

341
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,613
I remember how much you cared.

342
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:02,825
About the law, about what was right.

343
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,201
Before the clothes and the expense account,

344
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:05,494
and scrambling to make partner.

345
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:07,955
You're asking me to commit career suicide.

346
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,792
I'm asking you to trust me.

347
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,710
One way or another, Fisk, Owlsley,

348
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:16,130
anyone connected with
what they've been doing,

349
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:17,673
they're gonna get what's coming to them.

350
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,133
And there are gonna be some hard questions

351
00:26:19,216 --> 00:26:22,428
about how much Landman and
Zack knew and when they knew it.

352
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:25,556
This is your chance to
get out in front of that...

353
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:27,308
and take your soul back.

354
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:55,336
Whoa! Whoa, watch out!

355
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:24,545
Ellison in his office?

356
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:27,506
His kid's got something at
school, he'll be in later.

357
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:46,025
I know you want to stay,
but it's not safe at Saint Benezet.

358
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:48,527
There are people... They...

359
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,446
I liked it there.

360
00:30:52,323 --> 00:30:57,244
They brought me a piece of Zuppa
every night before I went to bed.

361
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:59,871
They have Zuppa in Italy,
Mother. The real kind.

362
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:03,084
I don't know any Italian.

363
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:06,712
- What am I gonna watch on the TV?
- Oh, we'll sort it out.

364
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:13,009
They brought a piece
of Zuppa... every night.

365
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:15,679
Mother...

366
00:31:20,016 --> 00:31:21,602
Mom.

367
00:31:26,857 --> 00:31:29,651
It's such a beautiful day, isn't it?

368
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:31,528
It is.

369
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:36,992
Have you thought any more
about my... my friend Wesley?

370
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:38,910
James Wesley?

371
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:42,038
We spoke about him on the phone.

372
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:45,126
Oh, yes, James.

373
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:47,794
- Such a handsome boy.
- Mmm.

374
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:50,422
Always so well dressed, polite.

375
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:52,758
He called you the other night.

376
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:55,136
He did?

377
00:31:56,595 --> 00:32:00,015
When I was busy. It was the
last phone call that he...

378
00:32:01,892 --> 00:32:03,977
Do you remember what you talked about?

379
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,359
Mother?

380
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:16,031
Such a beautiful day, isn't it?

381
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:28,043
- Hey, is he back?
- No.

382
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:30,837
His kid plays the cello, got a solo.

383
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,381
Looks like there's a reception after.

384
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:36,177
- Did you try his phone?
- Yeah, he's not picking up. Look...

385
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,721
sit tight until he gets back
and I can run this past him.

386
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:41,140
And keep your eyes open, okay?

387
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:43,392
Yeah. You, too.

388
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:47,188
Uh, hang on a second.

389
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:49,898
Yeah, I gotta take this. It's Matt.

390
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:51,400
I'll call you when I know something.

391
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:56,197
Hey, you coming in?

392
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,366
I had a rough
morning. I'm gonna need the day.

393
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:01,702
Listen...

394
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:04,037
I'm working on something.

395
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,789
I think it might help.

396
00:33:05,872 --> 00:33:09,335
But until I know for sure,
I need you to stay out of it.

397
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:11,670
If you talk to Foggy,
you tell him the same?

398
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:16,675
Uh, yeah, I'll pass it along...

399
00:33:16,758 --> 00:33:18,969
if I, uh, talk to him.

400
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:20,387
Uh, Karen?

401
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:25,642
Everything's gonna work out... I promise.

402
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:29,145
Yeah...

403
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,856
See you tomorrow.

404
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,362
- I'm not having this conversation.
- Yes, you are.

405
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,113
You're in the middle of having it with me.

406
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:41,408
Heard my son play Brahms today,
in front of the entire school.

407
00:33:41,492 --> 00:33:43,660
One of the greatest moments of my life.

408
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:46,455
I read the story you handed
me, the exact opposite.

409
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,164
This could expose Fisk.

410
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:51,293
All this story is gonna do is
expose this paper to a lawsuit.

411
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:53,670
I mean, there is no
follow-up, no corroboration.

412
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:56,047
You read what his mother said
about what he did when he was a kid?

413
00:33:56,131 --> 00:33:57,299
She's a sick old lady.

414
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,301
I mean, she probably thinks
Nixon's still in office.

415
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:01,428
Run the article. It'll
sell papers, it's sexy.

416
00:34:01,512 --> 00:34:02,929
You sound like a whore.

417
00:34:03,013 --> 00:34:05,224
Well, I learned how to be one from you.

418
00:34:06,057 --> 00:34:08,059
I get lucky sometimes, sure.

419
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:10,562
Land a story that makes a
difference, like Union Allied.

420
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:14,566
But most of the time, now,
working for this paper...

421
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:18,028
I might as well be wearing
lipstick and a red dress.

422
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,158
Take the rest of the
week. You're suspended.

423
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:25,452
Look, just take another look at it.

424
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:28,204
Fisk is leaving a trail of
bodies and if we don't stop it...

425
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:32,418
Wilson Fisk is spending millions
of dollars trying to save this city.

426
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,169
Maybe you should drop the
Woodward and Bernstein,

427
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:37,130
try writing a story about that.

428
00:34:37,213 --> 00:34:38,507
How much is he paying you?

429
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:42,886
Ever since Union Allied,

430
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:47,641
I can't get a story that's about what's
really happening in this city to print.

431
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,520
So, how much is Fisk paying
you to keep it that way?

432
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:56,317
The reason that you can't get any of
your crime pieces into the paper lately

433
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,819
is because they're shit, Ben.

434
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:00,236
Just like that one.

435
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:03,865
And I think, deep down, you know that, too.

436
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:06,535
You know what, forget about the suspension.

437
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:08,704
Clear out your office.

438
00:35:08,787 --> 00:35:10,914
I'm done trying to help you.

439
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,953
No, wait, wait, wait!

440
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:39,372
I'm trying to help you! Wait, no, please!

441
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:44,419
Couldn't find anything on
the Japanese that puts them on this.

442
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:45,587
Not that I would.

443
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:49,340
Bastards are like shadows in a dark room.

444
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:52,468
Maybe all this really
was that nut in the mask.

445
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:57,599
Poison and guns aren't the way he operates.

446
00:38:57,683 --> 00:39:01,186
Piss a guy off enough, he'll
start doing whatever it takes.

447
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:02,521
Francis.

448
00:39:04,147 --> 00:39:05,273
Sir?

449
00:39:05,356 --> 00:39:07,275
Double the offer on the streets.

450
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,278
- Keep doubling it until someone talks.
- Yes, sir.

451
00:39:11,822 --> 00:39:14,449
You trust him after
that beating you laid on?

452
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:16,702
Wesley trusted him.

453
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:18,912
That's all that matters now.

454
00:39:18,995 --> 00:39:20,330
That his?

455
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:21,497
Yes?

456
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:26,211
No, he's not able to come to
the phone. What do you have?

457
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:32,175
Thank you.

458
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,345
I have to go.

459
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:38,682
Go where? We're in the middle of...

460
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:17,178
All those people...

461
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:19,555
- You took their eyes.
- No.

462
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,058
They blinded themselves.

463
00:40:22,142 --> 00:40:23,685
Why would they do that?

464
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:26,229
Because they have faith.

465
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:28,732
In you and your drugs?

466
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:32,485
In something beyond the
distractions of your world.

467
00:40:33,737 --> 00:40:35,864
You have taken that from them.

468
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:39,785
Now, they will have nothing.

469
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,245
You're gonna tell me about Fisk.

470
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:16,947
Get these people out of here.

471
00:41:54,234 --> 00:41:55,777
You're going to be okay. Come on.

472
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,448
Police!

473
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,493
Don't you move!

474
00:42:05,954 --> 00:42:08,248
Hands, let me see your hands!

475
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:09,750
Hands!

476
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:16,089
Slowly, slowly.

477
00:42:17,257 --> 00:42:19,050
You're the guy.

478
00:42:19,134 --> 00:42:21,177
The one that killed
Blake and shot those cops!

479
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:29,728
I did not kill Detective
Blake, or shoot those cops.

480
00:42:34,107 --> 00:42:35,859
Blake and Hoffman were dirty.

481
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:37,568
Working for Wilson Fisk.

482
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:40,613
Along with a lot of
others in your precinct.

483
00:42:40,696 --> 00:42:42,908
I'm not the bad guy.

484
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:44,200
Then what are you?

485
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:53,043
Officer down. Call it in now.

486
00:43:06,431 --> 00:43:07,557
You're late.

487
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,352
Apologies, I was detained
by unfortunate events.

488
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:14,940
You speak English now?

489
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,733
The need for illusion has passed.

490
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,905
That have anything to
do with why you're late?

491
00:43:21,988 --> 00:43:23,990
The man in the mask.

492
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:27,368
- The heroin?
- Lost in the flames.

493
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:29,620
So, bring more in.

494
00:43:29,704 --> 00:43:33,041
My interest here has never
been about heroin, Leland.

495
00:43:33,124 --> 00:43:37,587
That was borne of convenience,
and it is no longer so.

496
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,301
Do what you want. I
could honestly care less.

497
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:47,222
If he finds out what we
did... this isn't gonna matter.

498
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:49,057
Wilson suspects?

499
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,017
Not yet, but that could change.

500
00:43:51,101 --> 00:43:54,604
We knew the risk, and the reward,

501
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:58,024
if his woman were to be
removed as a distraction.

502
00:43:58,108 --> 00:44:00,110
I should've just had her shot.

503
00:44:00,193 --> 00:44:02,737
Well, he still believes that
the poison was meant for him,

504
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:04,572
- yes?
- Far as I know.

505
00:44:04,655 --> 00:44:06,992
Then our path was the correct one.

506
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,702
Except for the part where
she's not dead, sure.

507
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:12,538
The woman is stronger than assumed.

508
00:44:12,622 --> 00:44:14,582
Yeah, she's a real mule.

509
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:17,543
What about Wesley?

510
00:44:17,627 --> 00:44:19,963
- What about him?
- He's dead.

511
00:44:20,046 --> 00:44:23,091
Found in a basement,
couple holes in his chest.

512
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:24,384
Thought maybe that was you.

513
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:28,471
No... he had never shown me discourtesy.

514
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:32,350
So, what's our play here?

515
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:35,103
The wheel constantly turns.

516
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:39,607
We must adapt to its position,
or be crushed beneath it.

517
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,610
What? Where the hell are you going?

518
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:46,572
I will visit my homeland
and reflect upon the future.

519
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:48,158
Home? China?

520
00:44:50,285 --> 00:44:52,913
It is a considerable distance farther.

521
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,249
We shall not speak again.

522
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,169
Fine, go!

523
00:45:00,086 --> 00:45:02,380
You think I don't have a fallback?

524
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:06,592
You think I got this far without
looking at my own damn tea leaves, huh?

525
00:45:07,802 --> 00:45:10,721
What, you think I'm gonna just...

526
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:24,360
Those for me?

527
00:45:24,444 --> 00:45:26,571
Till I get a better girl.

528
00:45:26,654 --> 00:45:28,073
You can't get a better girl.

529
00:45:28,156 --> 00:45:30,866
Don't I know it.

530
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:32,660
Ah...

531
00:45:34,495 --> 00:45:35,496
Mmm.

532
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:38,499
Hard day?

533
00:45:40,335 --> 00:45:41,461
I've had better.

534
00:45:41,544 --> 00:45:44,380
You've had worse, too. Am I right?

535
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:46,967
Usually are.

536
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,926
I have my moments.

537
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,429
Not many lately, but...

538
00:45:53,181 --> 00:45:54,849
Let's go to Paris...

539
00:45:56,017 --> 00:45:58,478
like we always talked about.

540
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,357
While we're still young.

541
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,693
Ooh, you want to run away together?

542
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:08,571
Or just... run away?

543
00:46:11,657 --> 00:46:14,285
How long we been together?

544
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:17,205
Don't remember a time when we weren't.

545
00:46:17,288 --> 00:46:20,750
Got to know that look in your eye early on.

546
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:26,047
Ben, there's a story eating at
you... one you know you gotta tell.

547
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:28,966
Not that simple.

548
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,470
Telling the truth is
never simple... or easy.

549
00:46:32,553 --> 00:46:35,515
Why, only the best of us ever really try.

550
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:37,433
Yeah.

551
00:46:38,351 --> 00:46:40,186
Ellison thinks it's a pile of shit.

552
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,938
You straighten him out.

553
00:46:43,023 --> 00:46:45,025
We got into it.

554
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:48,903
He let me go.

555
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:54,950
Good... You never needed that man.

556
00:46:55,035 --> 00:46:56,994
You never needed that paper.

557
00:46:57,078 --> 00:46:59,580
You only ever needed a story.

558
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:01,041
Go tell it.

559
00:47:01,124 --> 00:47:03,543
How? Shout it from the rooftops?

560
00:47:03,626 --> 00:47:07,838
You know there's this thing
called the Internet, right?

561
00:47:07,922 --> 00:47:10,883
Reach a whole lot of folks, huh?

562
00:47:10,966 --> 00:47:13,469
More than you ever could at the Bulletin.

563
00:47:13,553 --> 00:47:16,347
The Internet's all gossip, noise.

564
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:18,266
So, cut through it.

565
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:21,311
The world needs Ben
Urich to tell the truth...

566
00:47:21,394 --> 00:47:23,646
any way he can.

567
00:47:27,775 --> 00:47:30,570
- You quit?
- Not exactly the way it went.

568
00:47:30,653 --> 00:47:31,904
Oh...

569
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:34,615
I'm sorry.

570
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:36,201
Don't be.

571
00:47:36,284 --> 00:47:38,453
Bulletin's not the paper
I fell in love with.

572
00:47:38,536 --> 00:47:39,745
Hasn't been for a long time.

573
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:42,498
Just too damn stubborn to let it go.

574
00:47:42,582 --> 00:47:45,418
You really think Ellison
was taking money from Fisk?

575
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:48,671
Don't know. Explains a lot.

576
00:47:48,754 --> 00:47:51,257
So, uh, what do we do next?

577
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:53,509
Thinking I might start a blog.

578
00:47:53,593 --> 00:47:54,969
Hear that's all you kids read these days.

579
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:57,430
I thought you hated that kind of shit.

580
00:47:57,513 --> 00:47:59,682
Yeah, but you can reach an
awful lot of people that way

581
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:02,017
if you got the right story to tell.

582
00:48:02,102 --> 00:48:03,728
You're gonna write about
Fisk killing his father?

583
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:07,357
I'm going to write about all of it...

584
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,608
tonight.

585
00:48:09,442 --> 00:48:10,693
Get it out there.

586
00:48:10,776 --> 00:48:13,113
Fisk wants to sue me...

587
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:16,532
at least I know a couple decent lawyers.

588
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,246
This is gonna change
everything, Ben. It has to.

589
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:23,289
One foot in front of the other.

590
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:26,167
I'll send you the link when it's up.

591
00:48:26,251 --> 00:48:28,503
We'll go from there, okay?

592
00:48:28,586 --> 00:48:29,754
Call you in the morning.

593
00:48:29,837 --> 00:48:32,089
Okay.  Good night.

594
00:48:55,405 --> 00:48:58,199
Karen? Karen? You in there?

595
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,620
Yeah, just a minute.

596
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,377
I'm sorry.

597
00:49:11,587 --> 00:49:13,881
We, uh, locking this now?

598
00:49:17,218 --> 00:49:18,594
Seems like a good idea.

599
00:49:24,892 --> 00:49:26,227
Yeah...

600
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:33,693
It's, uh, late. You should go home.

601
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:39,657
Matt?

602
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:47,623
Is this what we are now?

603
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:52,545
Three people who don't
even talk to each other?

604
00:49:56,716 --> 00:49:58,301
I know this guy...

605
00:50:00,303 --> 00:50:02,096
We were close once.

606
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:06,392
He told me if I, uh...

607
00:50:09,144 --> 00:50:12,732
I'd have to push the people
that I care about away...

608
00:50:15,985 --> 00:50:18,279
if I wanted to be effective at what I do.

609
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:23,243
Seems like you listened.

610
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,703
Yeah.

611
00:50:26,746 --> 00:50:28,456
I thought I didn't.

612
00:50:29,624 --> 00:50:32,252
This guy, he has a way of, uh...

613
00:50:33,336 --> 00:50:35,630
getting in your head, you know?

614
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:41,594
And here's the thing...

615
00:50:43,012 --> 00:50:44,805
I had a really shitty night.

616
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:50,436
The kind where you think you've
seen the bottom of humanity,

617
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,899
and the pit just keeps
getting deeper, you know?

618
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,613
I... I can't...

619
00:51:02,782 --> 00:51:04,617
I can't do this alone.

620
00:51:07,578 --> 00:51:08,913
I can't...

621
00:51:10,956 --> 00:51:13,918
I can't take another step.

622
00:51:26,806 --> 00:51:30,393
You're not
alone, Matt. You never were.

623
00:52:54,935 --> 00:52:56,020
I've made mistakes...

624
00:52:57,855 --> 00:53:00,691
in the years since I was a boy.

625
00:53:01,776 --> 00:53:04,987
I try to learn from them,
but it isn't always enough.

626
00:53:06,196 --> 00:53:07,865
Get out of my house.

627
00:53:08,908 --> 00:53:10,284
I'll leave.

628
00:53:11,243 --> 00:53:15,289
But first, I'd... I'd like to
have a conversation with you.

629
00:53:15,372 --> 00:53:16,916
Off the record, of course.

630
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:19,752
You think I believe
anything you have to say?

631
00:53:21,253 --> 00:53:25,716
Well, I... I promise that I'll
be honest with you, Mr. Urich.

632
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:29,887
Whether you choose to
believe, that's up to you.

633
00:53:33,223 --> 00:53:34,559
All right.

634
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:37,770
Let's hear it.

635
00:53:37,853 --> 00:53:39,605
I want to apologize.

636
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:47,447
I thought that your days
of being relevant were past.

637
00:53:48,656 --> 00:53:50,450
And for thinking that, I...

638
00:53:51,492 --> 00:53:53,494
I'm truly sorry.

639
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,205
Apology accepted.

640
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:00,209
You know where the door is.

641
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:01,794
Oh...

642
00:54:04,714 --> 00:54:08,217
I know you lost your
position at the Bulletin.

643
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,471
News travels fast.

644
00:54:11,554 --> 00:54:17,059
After your article on... Union
Allied, I took precautions.

645
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:21,355
I didn't want to be surprised
by any more exposés.

646
00:54:22,397 --> 00:54:25,275
Figured you had somebody at
the paper on your payroll.

647
00:54:25,901 --> 00:54:29,404
As I said, I try to learn from my mistakes.

648
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:34,076
You're not the only one.

649
00:54:36,662 --> 00:54:41,041
And do you think that rambling on
the Internet will change anything?

650
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:46,463
People seek the truth... no
matter where they find it.

651
00:54:47,757 --> 00:54:51,301
That may have been the case
when you and I were young.

652
00:54:54,013 --> 00:54:59,602
This world around us is preoccupied
with celebrity weddings and...

653
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:02,187
videos of cats.

654
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:06,942
But... complicated issues,
issues that matter...

655
00:55:10,154 --> 00:55:12,072
they take too much focus.

656
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:16,451
They take too much time away from texting

657
00:55:16,536 --> 00:55:19,539
and the thousand channels
on the satellite dish.

658
00:55:20,372 --> 00:55:22,958
Guess I have more faith in humanity.

659
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:24,501
Ah.

660
00:55:25,878 --> 00:55:28,005
So did Christ, if I recall.

661
00:55:30,675 --> 00:55:32,051
I'll go.

662
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,845
Just one more thing.

663
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:42,061
Were you alone when you spoke to my mother?

664
00:55:49,193 --> 00:55:50,820
Your guy at the Bulletin.

665
00:55:50,903 --> 00:55:53,948
Yes, I received a call that was upsetting.

666
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:57,993
Were you alone?

667
00:56:00,037 --> 00:56:03,457
Yeah... I was alone.

668
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:08,045
Wesley, was that you?

669
00:56:09,088 --> 00:56:12,507
- Wesley?
- Yes, I didn't think so.

670
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:14,426
You're a man of principle, of conviction.

671
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:17,304
I understand that, I even admire it.

672
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:24,436
But you went after my mother.

673
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:30,484
That's not something that I can forgive.

674
00:56:34,947 --> 00:56:38,117
I wrote a lot of stories
in my years pushing ink.

675
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:43,163
You know how many times
people have threatened me...

676
00:56:43,247 --> 00:56:45,165
get me to keep my mouth shut?

677
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:52,172
But this is my mother... that
you brought into this, Mr. Urich.

678
00:56:52,256 --> 00:56:53,465
My mother!

679
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,765
So I am not here to threaten you.

680
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:02,683
I'm here to kill you.
