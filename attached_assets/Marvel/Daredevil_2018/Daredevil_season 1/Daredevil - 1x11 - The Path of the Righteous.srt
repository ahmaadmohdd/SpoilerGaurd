1
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,870
We need a doctor! Now!

2
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:34,831
Let's get a gurney out here!

3
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:37,459
- What happened?
- She drank something.

4
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:39,044
What did she ingest?
I need you to be specific.

5
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:42,214
I have no idea. It was at the
Van Lunt building, the benefit.

6
00:00:42,297 --> 00:00:43,340
There were others...

7
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:46,384
Uh, I had a glass in my hand.
Do I need to be checked out?

8
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:47,719
How long's
she been unconscious?

9
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:49,262
Twenty minutes.
Maybe a little longer.

10
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:50,555
Place is a rat hole.

11
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:51,848
It was the closest ER.

12
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,641
I reached out to Dr. Rosenberg.

13
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:54,976
He's on the jet.

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,061
Pupils are sluggish.

15
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:57,145
I need an intubation tray, stat!

16
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,314
Let's start 1,000 cc's
of Ringer's lactate to KVO

17
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:00,482
until we know what's going on.

18
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:03,985
Insert a Foley catheter...

19
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,529
- Hemodialysis and gastric lavage?
- I need a tox screen,

20
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,615
liver and kidney function,
coagulation tests.

21
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:09,699
I'll call ICU for a bed.

22
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:10,908
You said there were others,
how many?

23
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:13,620
Uh, four or five maybe.

24
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:16,623
Are you sure someone
shouldn't be looking at me?

25
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:18,083
We'll have a nurse
come check you out.

26
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,334
- I'm coming with her.
- I'm sorry,

27
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:20,460
we can't have you in there, sir.

28
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:22,212
- Don't you know who I am?
- Doesn't matter.

29
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,671
Fill out the paperwork.

30
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:27,134
We'll update you on her condition
as soon as we know anything.

31
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:43,125
Matt, it's Karen.

32
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:46,879
Come on, open the door.

33
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,967
I can't get a hold of Foggy
and there's nobody at the office.

34
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,385
What the hell is going on?

35
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,931
Matt...

36
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:04,105
Oh, my God.

37
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:08,443
You look like shit.

38
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,322
Then I'm looking
better than I feel.

39
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,493
We gonna sue?

40
00:03:19,454 --> 00:03:21,331
We should sue.

41
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:24,959
You know, whoever hit you,
we should go after 'em and...

42
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:28,255
What kind of car was it?

43
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:33,468
Please tell me it was, uh,
expensive and German.

44
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,512
Japanese...

45
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:37,179
and it was my fault.

46
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:40,141
I, uh...
should have been more careful.

47
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:42,101
What the hell happened in here?

48
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:44,229
Nothing, don't worry about it.

49
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:46,606
Oh, okay, I'll just, uh...

50
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,403
Little early for beer, isn't it?

51
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:54,989
Depends on the kind of day you're having.

52
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:56,366
You, uh... you want one?

53
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,701
Uh, no. No, thanks.

54
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:00,537
So where were you...

55
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,372
when this car hit you?

56
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:05,082
Uh, does it matter?

57
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,586
I'm thinking it might...

58
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:10,963
if there really wasn't any car.

59
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:14,216
- Karen...
- Does this have anything to do with Fisk?

60
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:17,345
With your going to see that...
Vanessa woman?

61
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:18,430
I told you, it was my fault.

62
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,265
- Let's just leave it at that, okay?
- No.

63
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:23,310
No, not okay.
Definitely not okay.

64
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:25,227
Look at you.

65
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,064
- Did somebody break in?
- No one broke in.

66
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:31,108
And no one beat the crap
out of you either, I'm guessing.

67
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:39,534
Do you remember
the last time that I was here?

68
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:41,911
Yeah, I remember.

69
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:44,456
And I was scared... terrified.

70
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,583
But then, you,
you gave me your shirt...

71
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,667
and you made me feel safe.

72
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,212
You made me feel like I could trust
everything that you said.

73
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:52,964
And you lied to me...

74
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,009
About having
the Union Allied pension file.

75
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:00,054
I didn't want anyone to get hurt...

76
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,349
like Daniel Fisher,

77
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,266
because of what I was doing.

78
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,103
Yeah, I know the feeling.

79
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:10,106
So that's it.

80
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,317
That's all you're giving me.

81
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,861
That's all that I have
right now, Karen.

82
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:18,615
Well, it's not all I have.

83
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,159
I found something.

84
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:26,163
Just a scrap of paper at the
county clerk's office... misfiled.

85
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:30,502
It's probably why Fisk didn't get it
sucked into a black hole.

86
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:31,794
What was it?

87
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,421
A marriage certificate...

88
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:36,924
for his mother, Marlene.

89
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:38,009
How does that help?

90
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:39,636
Because it's not to his father.

91
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,263
It's for when she remarried...

92
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:45,224
which was two years after
all the reports say she died.

93
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:46,518
She's still alive?

94
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,853
Yeah, she's living
at a care facility upstate.

95
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:50,897
Now, Ben and I took a drive...

96
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,107
Oh, Karen, Karen...

97
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,818
- Fisk could have people watching.
- I know.

98
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,945
- I know. I didn't leave my real name.
- You should have...

99
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,490
You should have talked to me or Foggy
before you ran off like that.

100
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,283
I tried...

101
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,576
but you weren't picking up.

102
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,666
- Did you speak to her, Fisk's mother?
- Yeah...

103
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,585
she's not all there, but...

104
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,921
Matt, what she said about Fisk...

105
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:18,340
he killed his father...

106
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:20,760
when he was 12.

107
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:25,932
Bashed his head in with a hammer,
and then she helped him cover it up.

108
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:32,104
Well, he was a minor.
It's not gonna be enough.

109
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:34,356
To put him in jail, no.

110
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:37,359
But it doesn't line up with everything
that Fisk has been saying.

111
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:39,361
Everything that he has
altered on the Internet

112
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:41,739
and at the...
the county clerk's.

113
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:44,701
It might be enough to at least get people
looking at him more closely.

114
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,744
From an old woman
who's not all there.

115
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:50,331
Well, I'm not hearing you and Foggy
come up with anything better.

116
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,417
Did you...
did you speak to him...

117
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:55,169
to Foggy?

118
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:58,465
Not since yesterday on the phone
when I guess he was...

119
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:01,634
covering for whatever it is
you're not telling me.

120
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:06,723
All right, go to the office and...
wait for him.

121
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:11,185
Tell him what you found, and Karen,
tell him... tell him that I said...

122
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,024
No, don't bother.
Just tell him what you found.

123
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:20,612
Karen, be careful, please.

124
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,663
You know...

125
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,417
maybe you should take
your own advice.

126
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:41,048
I... I got you a...

127
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,557
It's, um...

128
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,644
it's a balloon. I, um...

129
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:58,816
It's got a monkey on it.

130
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:24,008
You got somewhere to be?

131
00:08:27,094 --> 00:08:30,515
You're not in the woods.
Grunts don't count as words, Foggy Bear.

132
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:31,724
Please don't call me that.

133
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:34,060
I'll call you whatever
I damn well please.

134
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:35,144
Okay, just...

135
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,606
can you do it with your inside voice,
without speaking?

136
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:41,818
That's a very asshole thing to say.

137
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,319
- I'm impressed.
- Sorry.

138
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:45,362
And now you've ruined it.

139
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:47,198
You going to work or what?

140
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,992
Not today.
Maybe never, not with Matt.

141
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:55,372
You two have been friends
as long as I've known you.

142
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:59,544
Whatever's going on
between the two of you...

143
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:01,003
I don't really care...

144
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:02,504
okay?

145
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,006
Not gonna get sucked into the drama.

146
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:06,425
Mmm.

147
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:09,428
Lock the door behind you
when you leave.

148
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:39,500
This is awful.
Look at him.

149
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,418
How's he gonna run things?

150
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:44,631
Not the time, Leland.

151
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,466
This is exactly the time.

152
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:48,593
You keeping score here?

153
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:51,095
You think whoever did this
was trying to take

154
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:53,139
little miss hairdo
out of the equation?

155
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:54,807
That...

156
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,934
That does seem unlikely.

157
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:58,185
So where does that put us?

158
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,605
They almost got me, God damn it.

159
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:03,941
All to get to the big guy,
Christ.

160
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,070
Did Gao give any indication

161
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:09,781
she was still unhappy
when you spoke with her?

162
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:13,117
Not that I could tell.

163
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,702
My money's on the Japanese.

164
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:16,453
After what he did to Nobu...

165
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:19,456
The titles for all the buildings
in the city block the Japanese wanted

166
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,376
have been transferred to them,
per our original agreement.

167
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,003
As for Nobu...

168
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:27,589
they believe the man in the mask
was responsible for his... accident.

169
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:30,885
Right, sure. Well...

170
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:34,388
maybe he's the one who slipped
a hot dose into Vanessa's Bellini.

171
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:38,350
Keep an eye on their accounts.

172
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:42,271
If there are any sudden shifts,
it might tell us something.

173
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:43,355
Yeah?

174
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:50,822
Thank you, Francis.

175
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:55,492
What? What happened?
Is she dead?

176
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:57,745
No, but...

177
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:02,166
three of the others who drank
whatever that was have... passed.

178
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:03,459
"Passed..."

179
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:06,003
always hated that description.

180
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:10,466
Such a sad attempt to avoid
the bare-knuckle truth.

181
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:13,928
She'll make it.

182
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,598
You got a med degree in your pocket
I don't know about?

183
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:19,016
Why are you so sure?

184
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,852
Because she has to.

185
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:24,063
Don't get all weepy...

186
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:27,608
we have matters
that need to be addressed.

187
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:29,443
Hmm.

188
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:32,196
Reach out to Gao.

189
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,281
- Me?
- Mmm.

190
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:36,450
What if she's the one
who did all this?

191
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,160
Well, you said
you didn't think it was her.

192
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:40,037
What the hell do I know?

193
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,623
I was almost poisoned.
I'm not thinking straight.

194
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,126
Speak with Gao...

195
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,503
if she wasn't involved,

196
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:50,882
we might need her support
against further unpleasantries.

197
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,343
And if she was involved?

198
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:57,638
Then it's been an honor
doing business with you.

199
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:01,183
This might hurt.

200
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:05,521
You okay?

201
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:08,315
- You talking about the stitches?
- Mostly.

202
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,860
How'd you open this up again?

203
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:13,320
I just wanted to see
how much I could move.

204
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:16,490
- You really shouldn't be moving at all.
- I know.

205
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:21,537
You really need to rest.
Let yourself heal.

206
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,746
I meditate for that.

207
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,081
You meditate?

208
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:26,125
I learned when I was a kid.

209
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,879
Helps with the pain...
and healing faster.

210
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:31,505
Is that why you're still alive?

211
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:34,591
Or I'm just a contrary son of a bitch.

212
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,093
Either way,
you really need to ease up,

213
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:39,096
or I'll be stitching a corpse
next time around.

214
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:44,185
You really should get some kind of...
body armor, like I told you.

215
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:47,646
- Yeah, I'm thinking you might be right.
- There's a first.

216
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,899
When Fisk came at me
in the warehouse,

217
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,901
I sliced his jacket open.

218
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:53,861
- You cut him?
- No...

219
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:56,906
he was wearing some kind of armor
in the lining.

220
00:12:57,698 --> 00:12:59,658
It was, uh...

221
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,328
light and tough.

222
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:05,206
Like nothing
I've ever come across before.

223
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:08,750
That's what you get when you have
all the money in the world.

224
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:14,924
Hey, you want a drink or something?

225
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:18,677
No, Matt...

226
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,263
I don't want a drink.

227
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:24,600
Second woman today
that's turned me down.

228
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,103
Got a revolving door, do you?

229
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:28,604
That's not... not what...

230
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:30,064
- I didn't mean it...
- Forget it.

231
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:33,442
I have to get going.
I need to pack.

232
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:35,652
- Pack?
- Yeah.

233
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:37,446
Taking some time off...

234
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,407
get out of the city for a while.

235
00:13:40,491 --> 00:13:41,951
How much time?

236
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:43,953
Why?

237
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:47,123
You gonna miss me?

238
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:51,793
And if I said I would?

239
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:07,684
I didn't think I was ever
gonna see you again...

240
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,229
not alive.

241
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:13,482
Not after that last call
the night half the city blew up.

242
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:14,775
I left you a message when...

243
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:16,986
when it was over.

244
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:19,238
Yeah, you left a message.

245
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:21,365
Come on, what'd you expect, Claire?

246
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:26,537
You made it pretty clear
you didn't want to move forward with...

247
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,621
whatever this was.

248
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:29,498
You know what it was...

249
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:32,584
- what it could've been.
- If I stopped.

250
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,461
I'm not looking
to go around in circles, Matt.

251
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,755
I know you're not going to stop.

252
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:42,136
Not until this city is safe
from people like Fisk.

253
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:43,637
Which is never.

254
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:48,642
It'll always be something, someone...

255
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,145
you know that, right?

256
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:58,402
You told me you were the man
this city needs.

257
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:01,030
I think that was only half true.

258
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,535
I think you're also the man
this city created...

259
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:10,706
for better or worse.

260
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,294
I'm sorry you got pulled back into this.

261
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:21,425
At least I got to see you
with your shirt off again.

262
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:23,135
So, hey...

263
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,386
It's not all bad.

264
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:26,888
Thank you, Claire.

265
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:28,682
I know I keep saying it,

266
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:31,518
and it probably doesn't mean
anything at this point, but...

267
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:33,645
thank you.

268
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,983
I'll always be there...

269
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,611
when you really need me...

270
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:42,279
to patch you up.

271
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:45,491
Beyond that...

272
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:47,826
Yeah.

273
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:50,079
Yeah.

274
00:15:57,836 --> 00:16:01,923
You know, the only thing
I remember from Sunday school...

275
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:05,094
is the martyrs...

276
00:16:06,262 --> 00:16:08,514
the saints, the saviors...

277
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:11,850
they all end up the same way.

278
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:15,479
Bloody...

279
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,148
and alone.

280
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:19,941
I never said I was any of those.

281
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:23,695
You didn't have to.

282
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:39,128
- Hey.
- Hey.

283
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:42,923
You still mad?

284
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,634
What do you think?

285
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:49,305
I'm sorry, Ben,
I needed you...

286
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:51,473
You know who needs me, Karen?

287
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,725
My wife...

288
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:56,103
she needs me.

289
00:16:57,854 --> 00:16:59,981
- It was important.
- You could've just told me...

290
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,608
but no,

291
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:05,446
instead you gotta spin some story
about this great place upstate...

292
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,489
could be good for Doris.

293
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:09,158
Like you give a damn.

294
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:12,203
Hey, that's not fair.

295
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:16,123
Welcome to my life.

296
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:18,167
Wait, you're right.

297
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,751
You're right.
I should've told you.

298
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:21,628
Then why didn't you?

299
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:23,047
I...

300
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:25,382
was afraid you'd say no.

301
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:28,260
Probably would've.

302
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:30,179
This isn't a story.

303
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:32,514
This is people's lives.

304
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:35,601
And what Fisk has been doing,
the person that he really is...

305
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:39,855
We finally have the smoking gun or...
or whatever.

306
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,648
More a whatever than a gun.

307
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,276
You need to print this.

308
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,320
Get it out there
for everyone to see.

309
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:48,029
Not that simple.

310
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:50,699
Fisk killed his father,
people need to know that.

311
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,744
She's an old lady...

312
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:54,870
confused...

313
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:58,874
talking about things that...
maybe happened a long time ago.

314
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:00,626
So you don't believe her?

315
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:01,918
Okay...

316
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:04,755
let's play this out.

317
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,219
So I write up the story...

318
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:12,596
get it on the front page.

319
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:14,390
Then what happens?

320
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:17,351
Well, everybody will see that he's
been lying about his past.

321
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:21,480
Yeah, sure, absolutely will.

322
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,023
Then he goes on TV again,

323
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:25,609
tells everybody, yes,
he lied about his past

324
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:30,156
because he was just a scared little kid
trying to protect his mother.

325
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,949
Maybe he even rolls the old girl out,

326
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,785
gets all teary-eyed.

327
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:35,952
See where I'm going with this?

328
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:37,871
Sounds like you're going nowhere.

329
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,873
Need to think this through,
all I'm saying.

330
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,876
He's gonna win.

331
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,795
If we don't do something,
Fisk is gonna win.

332
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:47,798
There are no winners and losers
in something like this.

333
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:50,634
Well, Elena Cardenas
might disagree with you...

334
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:52,594
if she still could.

335
00:18:58,434 --> 00:18:59,976
Maybe we don't have to do anything.

336
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:03,063
What does that mean?

337
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:06,567
Hear about the benefit the other night
at the old Van Lunt building?

338
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,985
Fisk raising money
for his better tomorrow?

339
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:11,863
Yeah, a bunch of one-percenters
jerking each other off.

340
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:15,075
Though, I read
they all got food poisoning.

341
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,494
Don't think it was bad hors d'oeuvres.

342
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:21,039
Got an unconfirmed source, says...

343
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:22,999
it was something in the drinks.

344
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,626
Maybe even a couple fatalities.

345
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:26,878
Holy shit.

346
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,341
Why isn't this all over the news?

347
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:32,593
Fisk spinning it, I guess.

348
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:34,886
Which means he's got a lot
of pull in the media.

349
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,597
Maybe even at the Bulletin,
I don't know.

350
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,308
Wait, uh, back up.

351
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,602
If this is true,
why would someone attack a benefit?

352
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:44,230
Fisk made himself public.

353
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,772
People who he's connected with

354
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:48,442
might be less inclined
to be dragged out of the shadows.

355
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:51,069
You think someone's trying to kill Fisk?

356
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:55,241
I've been writing about crime in this city
since before you were born.

357
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,368
The only thing I know without a doubt...

358
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:01,079
is you don't get
to be the man at the top

359
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:05,125
without making enemies looking
to tear you down to the ground.

360
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:19,180
No.

361
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:28,399
There was a time when I...

362
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,735
I believed that I was complete...

363
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,617
that I needed no one to truly...
understand who I am.

364
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,751
If she dies...

365
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:52,256
Rosenberg's in from Hartford,
and she's strong.

366
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:54,508
- We've all seen that.
- Yes.

367
00:20:57,886 --> 00:20:59,305
Leland thinks...

368
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:02,391
it might have been Nobu's men.

369
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:05,436
Fate.

370
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,773
- Sir?
- It was something Gao said to me.

371
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:15,487
I had to choose a path
or fate would choose for me.

372
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:19,157
I sent Leland to speak with her.

373
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,285
You suspect her hand in this?

374
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:26,957
Until we know for certain,
I suspect everyone.

375
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,836
You need to find who did this.

376
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:33,672
You need to.

377
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,052
I want to look in their eyes
when I salt the earth with their blood.

378
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,390
Understood.

379
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:48,103
I told her the safest place
she could ever be was by my side.

380
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:49,187
This wasn't your fault.

381
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,857
Well, she's lying in there
because she was by my side.

382
00:21:57,237 --> 00:21:58,822
We'll make the arrangements.

383
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:03,076
If she recovers,
I want her sent away.

384
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:06,872
Somewhere far from me...
and the city.

385
00:22:06,955 --> 00:22:09,625
I... doubt she would want that.

386
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,252
Well, we seldom get everything we want...

387
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:13,962
not in this world.

388
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:16,673
But...

389
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:18,675
some of us deserve to.

390
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:25,682
Just move the appropriate funds
into place.

391
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:29,102
I'll have Leland attend to it.

392
00:22:29,185 --> 00:22:32,230
No, no, I want it done quietly.
Handle it yourself.

393
00:22:34,232 --> 00:22:36,610
I'll have the papers
messengered to your penthouse.

394
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:39,195
- Thank you, Wesley.
- Mmm.

395
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:46,703
I...

396
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:56,004
Thank you.

397
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:08,141
I know you've waited a while.

398
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:10,351
Just... please tell me
what's going on.

399
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:11,728
Is she gonna make it?

400
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:14,815
She's in an induced coma now.
She's gonna pull through.

401
00:23:14,898 --> 00:23:15,941
She'll pull through.

402
00:23:16,024 --> 00:23:18,318
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you so much.

403
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,028
Don't thank me.

404
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:46,847
Morning service was hours ago.

405
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,389
I know.

406
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,934
Confession?

407
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:54,688
Latte?

408
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:57,065
Not today, Father.

409
00:23:57,148 --> 00:24:00,736
Probably for the best,
already had four cups.

410
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:02,696
Decaf.

411
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,531
But you know there's still
a bit of caffeine in there

412
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:05,866
they just can't get out.

413
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:09,495
Some things are just...
too ingrained, I guess.

414
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,372
That thing...

415
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:15,834
brought you here last time...

416
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:19,254
didn't go so well?

417
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:20,714
Not so much.

418
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,092
The man...

419
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:25,218
you talked of...

420
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:27,345
did you...

421
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:28,847
No, I didn't kill him.

422
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:33,434
But I tried to.

423
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,189
And are you disappointed
that you didn't succeed...

424
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:40,817
or maybe a little relieved?

425
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:47,824
A friend of mine says that if I don't
change the way I do things...

426
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:49,492
the way I live my life...

427
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:54,039
I will end up bloody and alone.

428
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:55,290
You believe that?

429
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:59,085
I'm not afraid of dying.

430
00:25:00,503 --> 00:25:03,965
Lot of people aren't,
comes right down to it.

431
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,509
It's living scares
the holy crap out of 'em.

432
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:11,514
You know what I do?

433
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:14,517
Who I am?

434
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,235
Sacrament of Penance,
like I told you.

435
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,655
- Don't have to worry about...
- It's not what I'm asking.

436
00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:30,283
Yes, Matthew, I'm not an idiot.

437
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:32,994
I have a pretty good idea
who you are...

438
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,789
and what you do.

439
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:37,666
How you do it...

440
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,961
That's something else entirely.

441
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:42,087
Accident...

442
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,130
when I was a kid.

443
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:46,007
Used to think it was God's will.

444
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:47,425
Used to?

445
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:53,264
Yeah, he made each and every one of us
with a purpose, didn't he?

446
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:55,058
A reason for being.

447
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:56,685
I believe so, yes.

448
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:59,062
Then why did he put the Devil in me?

449
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,816
Why do I feel it in my heart...

450
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:05,235
and my soul...

451
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:10,406
clawing to be let out...

452
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,952
if that's not all part of God's plan?

453
00:26:17,664 --> 00:26:22,418
Maybe you're being called to summon
the better angels of your nature.

454
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:25,213
Maybe that's the struggle
you're feeling...

455
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:26,339
deep within you.

456
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:29,342
And how do you know the angels
and the Devil inside me

457
00:26:29,425 --> 00:26:30,719
aren't the same thing?

458
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:32,095
I don't,

459
00:26:32,178 --> 00:26:34,097
but nothing drives people
to the church faster

460
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,350
than the thought of the Devil
snapping at their heels.

461
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,730
Maybe that was God's plan all along.

462
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:45,400
Why he created him,
allowed him to fall from grace...

463
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:47,568
to become a symbol to be feared...

464
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:50,030
warning to us all,

465
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:54,409
to tread the path of the righteous.

466
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:45,186
I'm really not in the mood
for this tonight.

467
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:48,564
It's cool, man, it's cool.

468
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,651
We don't gotta do all that.

469
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:56,114
Go for the knife in your boot,
I break your leg.

470
00:28:56,197 --> 00:28:59,117
Go for the backup piece tucked behind
your belt, I throw you off the roof.

471
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,702
- We good?
- Yeah.

472
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:04,873
Yeah, man, we good.

473
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,132
I didn't say, "Get up."

474
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:17,218
What're you beating on me for?
I ain't done nothin'.

475
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:19,679
It's not about you.
I want information.

476
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:22,723
What I look like,
public damn library?

477
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,394
Ow! Jesus, all right!

478
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:28,939
What do you want to know, man? Shit.

479
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:30,023
Fisk.

480
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:33,151
- I don't know where he is, I swear.
- That's not the question.

481
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:36,780
Fisk wears some kind of body armor...
light, strong.

482
00:29:37,697 --> 00:29:38,782
Where's he get it?

483
00:29:38,865 --> 00:29:40,116
The hell should I know?

484
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,368
- Then you're no use to me.
- Whoa.

485
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:43,536
Whoa, whoa!

486
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:45,914
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait!

487
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:49,584
Body armor, body armor.
Yeah, yeah.

488
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:52,378
Yeah, body armor.

489
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:54,422
I think I might...
I think I might know a guy.

490
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:57,425
Give me the name.

491
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,752
Yeah, no, we're on the same page.

492
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:35,130
Let me call you...
I'll call you back.

493
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:40,510
How is she?

494
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:42,929
Well, she hasn't woken up.

495
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:48,601
Rosenberg says
that there may be complications.

496
00:30:48,684 --> 00:30:50,937
If that happens,
we'll deal with it.

497
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:55,191
My mother called.

498
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:57,903
Can you return,
see what she needs?

499
00:30:57,986 --> 00:31:00,113
- I'll take care of it.
- Get out of my way.

500
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:02,991
Um...

501
00:31:04,117 --> 00:31:06,369
how is she?
She, uh...

502
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:07,745
still with us?

503
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:09,497
Yes.

504
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,000
Well... that's something.

505
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,793
I don't want to be disturbed.

506
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:14,878
Understood.

507
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:17,630
I could use a minute,
before you...

508
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:21,551
What am I, invisible?

509
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:22,802
Did you speak with Gao?

510
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,889
We had a chat, yeah.

511
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:28,724
And?

512
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:30,018
And what?

513
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:31,811
She said she was deeply saddened

514
00:31:31,895 --> 00:31:36,066
and quoted a fortune cookie
or some mystical shit.

515
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:38,276
Did she sound sincere?

516
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:41,362
The hell do I know?
She was speaking in Chinese.

517
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:43,698
I don't think the guy translating for her
liked me very much.

518
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:47,160
He kept staring at me funny.

519
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:48,995
Funny how?

520
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,288
Funny!

521
00:31:50,371 --> 00:31:52,582
Who the hell cares?

522
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:56,586
She said she'd stand with us...
if it comes to that.

523
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:58,713
You believe her?

524
00:31:58,796 --> 00:32:00,966
I don't know, maybe.

525
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,175
We need to be sure.

526
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:05,803
The only thing I know for sure
is that he needs to get back to business

527
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:07,763
while there's still
business to get back to.

528
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:09,182
- He will.
- When?

529
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:10,808
When he deems it appropriate.

530
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:14,687
Well, doesn't that just
fill me with confidence?

531
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,649
Do you think whoever did this...
just roll up the sidewalk and move on?

532
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:21,361
If they came after him once,
they'll come after him again,

533
00:32:21,444 --> 00:32:23,279
sooner or later.

534
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,451
Go home, get some rest.
We'll call if you're needed.

535
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:30,870
Sure, I'll wait by the phone.

536
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:34,290
It's not like I have
anything better to do.

537
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:52,142
Hello, Marlene?
It's Wesley.

538
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:57,230
No, I work with your son.
We've met before.

539
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:00,608
James Wesley, that's right.

540
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:05,363
Uh, no, he's indisposed
at the moment, I'm sorry.

541
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:07,573
Was there something
I could help you with?

542
00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:15,165
Wait, I'm sorry.

543
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,001
Who came to visit you?

544
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:07,277
You shouldn't be here.

545
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:14,242
You work for Fisk?

546
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:18,954
I asked you a question.

547
00:35:32,427 --> 00:35:33,969
You shouldn't be here.

548
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:39,475
No, no, it's nothing.
I'll see to it, Marlene.

549
00:35:40,393 --> 00:35:43,521
Yes, I'll have him call you
as soon as he's free.

550
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:47,608
You, too.
Good night.

551
00:35:57,368 --> 00:35:58,953
I need your piece.

552
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,790
Discreetly, please.

553
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:08,629
Keys.

554
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:14,302
You want I should drive you?

555
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:17,012
No, I want as many men on him
as possible at all times.

556
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:20,475
No one goes in or out of that room
without you checking 'em first, clear?

557
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:22,310
Yeah, what if he asks for you?

558
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:23,769
Tell him I won't be long.

559
00:36:44,707 --> 00:36:46,251
That wasn't very nice.

560
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:49,730
You're not supposed to be in here.

561
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:52,817
Mr. Fisk's gonna be mad.

562
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:56,236
He's gonna hurt her.

563
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:57,780
Who...
Who's he gonna hurt?

564
00:37:57,863 --> 00:38:01,784
Melvin, that's your name, isn't it?

565
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,118
Melvin Potter?

566
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,582
How do you know that?

567
00:38:08,248 --> 00:38:10,835
Who's Fisk going to hurt, Melvin?

568
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:13,296
Betsy.

569
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:19,677
Who's... Who's Betsy?

570
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:25,057
She's nice, she helps me...

571
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:29,979
when I...
when I get confused.

572
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,023
Why would...
why would Fisk want to hurt her?

573
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:36,527
No one's supposed to be here, in...
in the shop,

574
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:38,654
unless he brings them.

575
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:41,073
So you do work for Fisk.

576
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:45,495
I said no, when he asked.

577
00:38:45,578 --> 00:38:50,541
Said no, Betsy wouldn't like it.

578
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,793
She wants me to be good.
I gotta be good.

579
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:56,964
So I... I make things.

580
00:38:58,132 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm good at making things.

581
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:01,927
I'm sorry, Melvin.

582
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:05,264
Fisk has hurt people
that I care about, too.

583
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:07,475
I know what it's like
to worry about them...

584
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:10,645
wanting to keep them safe.

585
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:12,730
He make you work for him, too?

586
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:15,400
No, I don't work for Fisk.

587
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:20,112
I want to stop him
from hurting anyone else...

588
00:39:20,195 --> 00:39:21,656
from hurting Betsy.

589
00:39:23,658 --> 00:39:25,618
- You could do that?
- Maybe.

590
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:28,328
Did you make a suit for Fisk?

591
00:39:29,455 --> 00:39:32,166
Did you make a suit
lined with this?

592
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:35,795
Made a whole bunch.
It keeps him safe.

593
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,088
Can you make something
for me out of this?

594
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:42,301
You want a suit, like...
like Mr. Fisk?

595
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:45,846
No. No, I want
something very special.

596
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,932
And if you do this for me...

597
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:50,768
I promise to get
Fisk out of your life...

598
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:53,854
and to keep Betsy safe.

599
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:58,108
You can do that?

600
00:39:58,192 --> 00:39:59,819
With your help, I...

601
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:01,153
I think maybe I can.

602
00:40:01,236 --> 00:40:03,781
What do you want me to make?

603
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:06,325
A symbol.

604
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,696
You're a dick.

605
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:46,657
The hell did I do?

606
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:52,246
I've been calling you all day.

607
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:54,790
Been busy.

608
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:58,127
- Did you even listen to my messages?
- Yeah.

609
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:01,130
- And?
- And what?

610
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:05,009
You got a crazy old lady with a story

611
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:07,427
about a young Willie Fisk
beaning his dad with a hammer.

612
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,346
He beat his father to death.

613
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:11,599
He was 12,
40 some years ago.

614
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:13,809
Jesus, why don't any of you...

615
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:17,897
His mother is supposed
to be dead.

616
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,691
Foggy,
this proves that Fisk's been lying.

617
00:41:20,775 --> 00:41:22,359
You know who we're dealing with.

618
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:24,779
It won't be enough.

619
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:28,115
You sound just like Matt.

620
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:32,411
You talked to him?

621
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:36,415
He asked the same about you.

622
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:39,126
- He did?
- When I was over at his place.

623
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:41,587
What the hell happened?

624
00:41:41,671 --> 00:41:44,715
And don't... don't tell me
that it was a car accident.

625
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:46,383
Ask him.

626
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:48,803
- I did.
- What'd he say?

627
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:51,346
Just that... it was his fault.

628
00:41:53,223 --> 00:41:54,642
Got that right.

629
00:41:56,101 --> 00:41:58,353
What is going on with you two?

630
00:41:58,437 --> 00:42:00,230
Why weren't you at the office?

631
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:02,482
- It's not like we have any clients.
- Foggy...

632
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:14,620
We're going through a rough patch.

633
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:16,706
Found the Nelson and Murdock sign
in the trash.

634
00:42:18,082 --> 00:42:20,250
A very rough patch.

635
00:42:21,877 --> 00:42:23,503
You wanna talk?

636
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:26,173
Yeah...

637
00:42:29,134 --> 00:42:30,510
but I can't.

638
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:36,433
Why?

639
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:41,480
It's...

640
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:45,525
If you say "it's complicated,"
I will punch you in the face.

641
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,152
It's personal!

642
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,947
It's personal, okay?

643
00:42:56,662 --> 00:42:58,455
Okay...

644
00:42:58,538 --> 00:43:00,040
okay, it's personal, I get it.

645
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:03,794
Really don't.
Trust me.

646
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:11,010
They started tearing down
Elena's tenement building today.

647
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:13,888
Did you know that?

648
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:16,556
No, I didn't.

649
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:20,560
Fisk is still out there, Foggy.

650
00:43:23,272 --> 00:43:25,900
Be nice if you and Matt
could get your heads out of your asses

651
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:27,610
and help do something about it...

652
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:32,364
before there's nothing left
of Hell's Kitchen to fight for.

653
00:43:39,371 --> 00:43:44,376
Uh, Matt, it's Karen.
I just saw Foggy at Josie's. He's, um...

654
00:43:45,544 --> 00:43:48,130
Can you two please
get your shit together?

655
00:43:48,213 --> 00:43:52,301
I thought we were supposed to be a team,
not whatever this is, okay?

656
00:43:52,384 --> 00:43:55,012
Call me back... seriously.

657
00:43:57,056 --> 00:43:58,307
Bye.

658
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:10,569
- Yeah.
- Hi...

659
00:44:10,653 --> 00:44:13,155
- it's Karen.
- I know.

660
00:44:13,238 --> 00:44:17,076
They got this thing, caller ID,
might have heard of it.

661
00:44:18,744 --> 00:44:20,037
You still sound pissed.

662
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:22,998
Just tired.

663
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,127
You okay?

664
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:29,839
Will be.
What's up?

665
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:34,301
Matt and Foggy are...

666
00:44:34,384 --> 00:44:36,553
I don't know what.
They had some kind of fight and now...

667
00:44:37,304 --> 00:44:39,724
I feel like it's falling apart, Ben.

668
00:44:41,183 --> 00:44:42,309
All of it.

669
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:46,313
Ah, it's usually right around the time
you know the story's getting interesting.

670
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:52,069
How do you do this...

671
00:44:53,112 --> 00:44:54,363
day after day?

672
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:59,201
One foot in front of the other,
just like everybody else.

673
00:44:59,284 --> 00:45:02,246
Yeah, but you're not
like everybody else.

674
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:04,915
You know that, right?

675
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:08,085
We all do what we can.

676
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,921
Sometimes it's enough.

677
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:13,841
Thank you, Ben.

678
00:45:16,593 --> 00:45:18,053
I didn't say I was writing that story.

679
00:45:18,137 --> 00:45:20,139
I know. I know.

680
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,475
Just thank you for...

681
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:25,394
for being there, for...

682
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:27,604
for caring.

683
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:31,066
You, too.

684
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:34,569
Talk tomorrow?

685
00:45:35,487 --> 00:45:38,866
Yeah, talk tomorrow.

686
00:45:40,993 --> 00:45:42,411
Okay.

687
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,240
Shit, seriously?

688
00:46:33,545 --> 00:46:35,547
I don't know how to pray.

689
00:46:39,134 --> 00:46:41,511
My father was not a religious man.

690
00:46:41,595 --> 00:46:45,099
My mother wanted to be...
I think, needed to be,

691
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:48,185
but she never quite
found it within herself.

692
00:46:51,605 --> 00:46:54,024
I'd seen it in movies,

693
00:46:54,108 --> 00:46:56,610
and watched it on television.

694
00:46:56,693 --> 00:47:00,572
I read it in books when I was a child,
after I was sent away.

695
00:47:01,615 --> 00:47:04,284
And I tried to mimic words...

696
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:08,205
the sentiment...

697
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:17,006
but it was false.

698
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:21,093
It was imitation of faith.

699
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,889
So...

700
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:29,143
I can't pray for you.

701
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,857
All I can do...

702
00:47:35,941 --> 00:47:38,402
is make you a promise.

703
00:47:38,485 --> 00:47:41,030
One that not even God,
if there is such a thing,

704
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:43,365
can prevent me from keeping.

705
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:50,330
The people that did this to you...

706
00:47:51,456 --> 00:47:52,624
they will suffer.

707
00:47:58,005 --> 00:47:59,298
They will suffer.

708
00:48:34,874 --> 00:48:36,168
I thought...

709
00:48:37,086 --> 00:48:38,837
maybe you weren't coming out of it.

710
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:42,216
That would have been a shame.

711
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:44,509
Tut-tut.

712
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:48,222
You might wanna take a moment.

713
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:53,018
In the meantime, I...

714
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:54,686
I thought we could chat.

715
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:08,158
You can't do this.

716
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:14,331
And yet, here we are.

717
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,464
You know, funny story,
after the Union Allied article, I...

718
00:49:22,547 --> 00:49:25,634
inquired as to whether
you needed further attention.

719
00:49:25,717 --> 00:49:28,053
The feeling was you'd already
done whatever damage you could,

720
00:49:28,137 --> 00:49:29,888
so it wasn't necessary.

721
00:49:29,971 --> 00:49:32,474
You were a... nobody...

722
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:35,477
a very small cog
in the machine.

723
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,855
So, an offer was made
through a third party.

724
00:49:39,773 --> 00:49:41,816
A legal agreement,
one you signed...

725
00:49:42,776 --> 00:49:45,154
in exchange for a reasonable
amount of money.

726
00:49:45,237 --> 00:49:46,696
Well...

727
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,365
reasonable to you.

728
00:49:51,785 --> 00:49:54,246
You were supposed
to go away, Miss Page.

729
00:49:54,954 --> 00:49:57,291
Fade back into...

730
00:49:57,374 --> 00:49:59,459
wherever people like you fade.

731
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:01,878
But you made a choice...

732
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:05,799
and that choice has brought you here...

733
00:50:05,882 --> 00:50:08,552
on this night,
at this particular moment in time.

734
00:50:10,804 --> 00:50:12,806
Perhaps that's the way
it was always gonna be.

735
00:50:12,889 --> 00:50:14,808
Perhaps we're destined...

736
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:18,603
to follow a path
none of us can see, only...

737
00:50:19,521 --> 00:50:20,647
vaguely sense,

738
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,318
as it takes our hand,
guiding us towards the inevitable.

739
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:26,570
Is that supposed to scare me?

740
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:28,655
No, no...

741
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:30,699
uh, this is.

742
00:50:47,757 --> 00:50:49,050
Do I have your attention?

743
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,184
Hello, could you, like,
nod or something?

744
00:51:02,106 --> 00:51:03,940
Do you love this city?

745
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:06,776
What?

746
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,279
It's a simple question.
Do you love this city?

747
00:51:09,946 --> 00:51:10,947
I...

748
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:13,325
I, um...

749
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,745
haven't been here long enough.

750
00:51:16,828 --> 00:51:17,871
Huh.

751
00:51:17,954 --> 00:51:20,540
I find a few days,
a week at most,

752
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:23,418
is ample time to form
an emotional response.

753
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:27,547
Growing to love something is really...

754
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:30,759
simply forgetting slowly
what you dislike about it.

755
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:36,390
I'll be perfectly honest,
the situation calls for it, I do not...

756
00:51:37,516 --> 00:51:39,309
love this city.

757
00:51:40,018 --> 00:51:43,438
The crush of the unwashed garbage
stacked on the sidewalk,

758
00:51:43,522 --> 00:51:46,233
the air that seems
to adhere to your skin,

759
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:49,986
the layer of filth you can never
completely wash away.

760
00:51:51,155 --> 00:51:53,114
Maybe you should move.

761
00:51:54,408 --> 00:51:57,286
I'm not here because I want to be.
I'm here because I'm needed.

762
00:51:58,745 --> 00:51:59,788
By Fisk?

763
00:52:01,415 --> 00:52:04,125
He loves this city.

764
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:06,336
In a way you and I never could.

765
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,837
I don't expect you to understand that.

766
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:10,299
There are moments
when even I struggle to,

767
00:52:10,382 --> 00:52:11,925
but he does...

768
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:14,344
very deeply.

769
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:17,764
Almost, I suspect, as much
as he loves his mother.

770
00:52:24,103 --> 00:52:27,816
Frankly, I was surprised
she remembered you.

771
00:52:29,776 --> 00:52:33,697
Recent memories for her
are fleeting gossamer...

772
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,492
often plucked from grasp
by the slightest breeze.

773
00:52:37,576 --> 00:52:40,745
But you, you left an impression.

774
00:52:41,913 --> 00:52:44,499
The nice blonde lady
with the big blue eyes.

775
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:48,420
And the man you were with,
Mr. Urich, I'm guessing.

776
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:52,341
My employer...

777
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:55,969
Sorry, old habits.
Mr. Fisk...

778
00:52:56,886 --> 00:52:58,555
as I said,
loves his mother.

779
00:52:58,638 --> 00:53:00,974
He would be extremely...

780
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,353
disturbed...

781
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:06,688
if he knew you'd found her.

782
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:08,440
Even more so
that you've been to see her.

783
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:12,193
You haven't told him?

784
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:14,446
He's preoccupied
with more important matters,

785
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:17,073
so I've taken it upon myself
to address the situation.

786
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:22,036
If you're going to kill me...

787
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:24,748
just do it.

788
00:53:25,832 --> 00:53:27,751
I'm sick of listening
to your bullshit.

789
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:36,217
I'm not here to kill you, Miss Page.
I'm here to offer you a job.

790
00:53:45,935 --> 00:53:48,187
Can I get a coffee, please? Black.

791
00:53:49,564 --> 00:53:51,441
Can I get you anything to eat, sir?

792
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:54,861
No, thank you, Francis.
Where's Wesley?

793
00:53:57,155 --> 00:53:59,866
So, after all of this,
I'm supposed to, what...

794
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,870
Be your secretary?

795
00:54:03,953 --> 00:54:06,831
The position I have in mind
is a little more...

796
00:54:06,915 --> 00:54:08,375
involved.

797
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,043
You've proven yourself resourceful,

798
00:54:10,126 --> 00:54:12,921
tenacious, with a commendable
ability to convince others

799
00:54:13,004 --> 00:54:14,589
that your way is the right one,

800
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:16,716
the way that needs to be followed,

801
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,929
pursued despite the obvious repercussions
such actions may incur.

802
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:22,722
Is that even English?

803
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:23,807
Ha...

804
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:26,601
simply stated...

805
00:54:28,812 --> 00:54:31,981
you're going to convince Mr. Urich...

806
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:33,983
that everything is fine...

807
00:54:35,026 --> 00:54:39,573
that you were wrong...
that Wilson Fisk is a good man...

808
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,951
a man this city needs.

809
00:54:43,034 --> 00:54:45,912
And then you're going
to spread the gospel

810
00:54:45,995 --> 00:54:49,082
to everyone you've infected
with your negative point of view.

811
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:52,210
I'd rather die first.

812
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:56,715
But you won't...

813
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:59,676
be the first to die, Miss Page, no.

814
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:03,054
No, I think Mr. Urich
will have that honor.

815
00:55:03,137 --> 00:55:07,351
Then we'll go to your place of employment,
see to Mr. Nelson, Mr. Murdock.

816
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:11,187
After that, your friends, family,
everyone you've ever cared about.

817
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:14,358
And when you have
no tears left to shed, then...

818
00:55:16,568 --> 00:55:19,863
then we'll come for you, Miss Page.

819
00:55:46,347 --> 00:55:47,516
Hmm.

820
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:50,852
Do you really think...

821
00:55:50,935 --> 00:55:54,398
I would put a loaded gun on the table
where you could reach it?

822
00:55:56,816 --> 00:55:58,234
I don't know.

823
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:05,033
Do you really think this is
the first time I've shot someone?

824
00:56:10,371 --> 00:56:11,456
Miss Page...
