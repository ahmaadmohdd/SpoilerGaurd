1
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,148
You cook for every girl you bring home?

2
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:59,901
Nah, just the ones that keep me alive.

3
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,407
You have a job or something to get to?

4
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:06,742
Or are you one of those
billionaire playboys

5
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:09,077
I'm always hearing about?

6
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,412
No, I have a job.

7
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:13,624
Damn, thought I'd lucked out.

8
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:15,959
What do you do?

9
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:20,506
Lawyer. I have a practice, so...
my own boss.

10
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:23,259
Lawyer by day, vigilante by night.

11
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,386
The hell does that work?

12
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,430
Yeah, I'll let you know
when I figure it out.

13
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:35,228
Oh, shit.

14
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,072
You just opened
one of the cuts on your back.

15
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,442
How do you know that?

16
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:42,444
I can taste copper in the air.

17
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,783
"Copper in the air."

18
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,288
May I?

19
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,541
Knock yourself out, Houdini.

20
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:12,223
The swelling's down.

21
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,853
Rib fracture's only a hairline.
I couldn't tell before.

22
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,856
You have X-ray fingers now?

23
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,570
I can hear your bones shift
when you breathe.

24
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:26,655
No grinding means nothing's broken.

25
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:29,616
What does a hairline fracture sound like?

26
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,580
An old ship.

27
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:37,916
How do you...

28
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,294
I mean, I know that you're blind,

29
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:44,214
but you... see so much.

30
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:49,052
How?

31
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,807
I guess you have to think of it
as more than just five senses.

32
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,480
I can't see, not like everyone else,
but I can feel.

33
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,899
Things like balance and direction.

34
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:07,237
Micro-changes in air density, vibrations,

35
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,281
blankets of temperature variations.

36
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,286
Mix all that with what I hear,
subtle smells.

37
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:19,040
All of the fragments form a sort of...

38
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,669
impressionistic painting.

39
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,257
Okay, but what does that look like?

40
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,552
Like, what do you...

41
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,639
actually see?

42
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,644
A world on fire.

43
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,949
If all I saw was fire,
I'd probably want to hit people, too.

44
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:57,454
I just wish I knew
I was hitting the right ones.

45
00:03:58,497 --> 00:03:59,706
Claire...

46
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,210
they know who you are now.

47
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,712
And they're not going to stop.

48
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,633
I'd like you to stay here, with me...

49
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:13,011
just till I figure something out.

50
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:20,564
That's a hell of a way
to get a girl to move in.

51
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:22,438
It worked, didn't it?

52
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:27,067
Hmm.

53
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:05,606
I was wondering
if you were ever gonna do that.

54
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,359
Well, I've been a little busy.

55
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:14,615
I'll get you some clothes while I'm out.

56
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:15,782
Mmm.

57
00:05:21,997 --> 00:05:24,040
Why don't you go to the police?

58
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,627
With all that you have on the Russians?

59
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,754
I wear a mask and beat on people.

60
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:31,673
Doesn't exactly mesh with police policy.

61
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:33,341
You're going to end up
in another dumpster,

62
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:35,927
you try to take down
the entire Russian mob yourself.

63
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,428
Maybe I only need to take down one man.

64
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:38,680
Fisk?

65
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:41,725
Cut off the head of the snake,
the body dies.

66
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:45,896
How do you know he's the head of the snake
if you can't find anything on him?

67
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,272
There was a murder in a bowling alley.

68
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:51,610
A man named Prohaszka.
Owned a majority in Kitchen Cabs.

69
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,904
They were turning those over
in the garage they took me to.

70
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:57,908
Right, I think Fisk hired the man
that killed Prohaszka.

71
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,618
Everything leads back to him...

72
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:02,704
but no one will talk.

73
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:05,123
Maybe you are beating
on the wrong people.

74
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:08,126
I heard a name, when they were...

75
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,381
The prick with the baseball bat
reacted when he heard it.

76
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:15,717
Like a dog when you yank his leash.

77
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:17,719
What was the name?

78
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,932
Vladimir.

79
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,852
It's me again. Call me back.

80
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,020
Shithead.

81
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:36,321
My employer sends his regards.

82
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:39,157
And his gratitude
that his offer was accepted.

83
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,745
There are still a few small details
we'd like to iron out before...

84
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,957
Uh, where's your brother?

85
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,585
This is a thing I was going to ask you.

86
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:53,714
Last time I saw him,
he was heading to see Mr....

87
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:57,050
Your employer.

88
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,845
He practically kissed me
when we agreed to terms.

89
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:03,724
He have a girl or... a boy
he might be celebrating with?

90
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:04,891
You try his cell?

91
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:07,102
- He does not answer.
- Try again.

92
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:10,689
We need to lock this down and get
distribution back to acceptable levels.

93
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,197
We found him.

94
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,917
Where?

95
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:32,681
He was dumped in the lot
around the corner.

96
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,473
My brother.

97
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:49,310
My brother.

98
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,192
We should have returned to Moscow.
Like you wanted...

99
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,478
The man in the mask.

100
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:15,854
He sends us a message.

101
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,506
Put every man we have on the street.

102
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,676
Find him.

103
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,639
And bring me his head.

104

105
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:46,177
Anyone else wondering about this?

106
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:04,112
Why aren't we meeting in the usual place?
And what's all this?

107
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:05,321
An opportunity...

108
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:09,242
for those willing to seize it.

109
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:19,460
She's happy to see you.

110
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:23,757
My apologies...

111
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:27,093
for my absence of late.

112
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:30,013
And for calling you here
on little notice.

113
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,391
Where are the Smiley Twins?
Sleeping off another kidnapping?

114
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:36,812
The Ranskahovs are no longer
a part of this organization.

115
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:37,896
Since when?

116
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,902
Since I removed Anatoly's head...
with my car door.

117
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,991
She's upset they weren't consulted.

118
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:53,912
He isn't happy either.

119
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:57,791
Deal me in on that.
What the hell happened?

120
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,048
It was a personal matter.

121
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,134
What? That's...

122
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:13,764
Vladimir isn't exactly
a hug-it-out kind of guy.

123
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:18,937
The masked vigilante killed his brother.
At least that's what Vladimir believes.

124
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,773
It will distract him
until preparations can be made.

125
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:28,321
We all knew that we would need to
eliminate the Russians one day.

126
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:31,867
They were too unpredictable.

127
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,328
This from a guy
taking heads off with a car door.

128
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,961
She wants to know
how her product is going to be moved now.

129
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:44,545
For the moment, you would...

130
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,923
keep sending your deliveries
to the Russians,

131
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,342
as though nothing has changed.

132
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:52,553
And when this is all over,
I'll assume their responsibility.

133
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:56,099
And move their share
to your column in the ledger?

134
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:02,313
A rising tide raises all boats, Leland.

135
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:05,275
Profits will be divided up
equally among us.

136
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,945
Four shares, instead of five.

137
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,004
Leland?

138
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:30,383
What, I'm going against the three of you?

139
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,969
I like my head where it's at.

140
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:36,722
Then we're in agreement.
Nothing changes...

141
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:39,642
until I'm ready to move on Vladimir.

142
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,271
And what if he finds out the truth
before that happens?

143
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,900
That would be unfortunate for all of us.

144
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,821
Masked vigilantes, crazy Russians...

145
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:54,657
I'm getting my stun gun out of storage.

146
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,663
Remember your promise to me...

147
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,790
and those I speak for.

148
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:10,715
Madame Gao...

149
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:14,052
may I walk you to your car?

150
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,103
She thinks you want something.

151
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:31,277
I want to put this behind us...

152
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,530
as quickly as possible.

153
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:52,923
Shut up.

154
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,261
Ask him about the man in the mask.

155
00:13:57,512 --> 00:13:58,888
Hey.

156
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,307
Man in black mask... you know?

157
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,145
Any of you Gao's runners know anything?

158
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:08,981
I'm talking to you!

159
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,483
Hello?

160
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:16,364
Piotr, the guy's an idiot.

161
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:19,950
Let's go.

162
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:29,752
Wait.

163
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:48,456
Huh?

164
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:35,211
- Where's Vladimir?
- No, please!

165
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,421
Vladimir! Where is he?

166
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:38,923
Please, I'll tell you what you want!
Just don't cut my head off!

167
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:40,175
What are you talking about?

168
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:43,719
Vladimir's brother.
Everyone knows you took his head.

169
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,895
On the ground! On the ground!

170
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:04,699
Be advised two on foot.

171
00:17:04,782 --> 00:17:06,242
One en route to the 15th.

172
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:10,413
No! Oh, my God.

173
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,873
You don't make any sense!

174
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:17,962
Whoa, be nice to it.

175
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:20,130
You know, for when the machines take over.

176
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:22,717
I can't get any of this crap
I bought to work.

177
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,302
Bad time to mention the phones?

178
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:26,762
All I hear when I try to dial
is a bunch of clicks.

179
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:30,140
Could be the machines plotting,
but I don't speak computer overlord.

180
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:32,142
- No, it's the rats.
- The who what now?

181
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,604
They chewed through the main line.

182
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,232
Phone guy's working on it now.
Exterminator's Monday.

183
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:39,567
We have rats now.
I'm never sleeping here again.

184
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:41,527
Then there's an upside.

185
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:43,756
Hey, you guys hear
anything on the news

186
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,198
about a Russian
getting his head cut off?

187
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,574
In Hell's Kitchen?

188
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:49,369
This city. Bad enough you get mugged,
now they chop your melon off.

189
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:51,912
What's next, groping corpses?

190
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:54,081
Excuse.

191
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,751
Is this, um...

192
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,170
Señor Foggy law?

193
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:03,299
Bess Mahoney? Brett's mom?

194
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,260
Sí, she refer me.

195
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:09,389
Something about cigars?

196
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:11,224
You know Spanish?

197
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,017
Oh, just what I remember from high school.

198
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,185
Mrs. Cardenas, tell us what happened.

199
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:20,608
Mi casa es rent-control.

200
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:24,194
But the landlord, Señor Tully...

201
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,657
Armand Tully?
Sleaze bag owns buildings all over town.

202
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,159
Sí, y señor Tully...

203
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:39,419
He wants to convert
the apartments to condominiums.

204
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:42,171
And he wants them out.

205
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:47,385
Men came weeks ago.
They said that they were workers.

206
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,307
And they destroyed the apartments with a...
I don't know that last word.

207
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,599
Sledgehammers.

208
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,976
College.

209
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,188
You ever have a client that
wants to chat in Punjabi, I'm your man.

210
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,440
Um...

211
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:01,816
Do you want to do this?

212
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:03,818
No, no. I like listening to your voice.

213
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:08,781
Go on, Mrs. Cardenas.

214
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:12,159
There is damage, en todas partes.

215
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:13,619
Everywhere.

216
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:19,292
They have no working sinks or pipes.

217
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,378
They don't have water
or electricity for days.

218
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:25,590
We call policía. We speak to the officer.

219
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,845
- The police couldn't help.
- Policía say, "It is a city issue."

220
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,057
They don't know what to do.

221
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,810
This says Tully offered them 10,000

222
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,480
to give up their rent control
and vacate the premises.

223
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:43,399
Maybe we can pressure him
into giving a better payout.

224
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,610
No, Señor Foggy.

225
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:50,615
We do no want money.
We want to stay in our homes.

226
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:12,654
This way, Mrs. Cardenas.

227
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,347
I heard you say my name.
Why'd you say my name?

228
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,308
I told her you're going to
talk to Tully's lawyer.

229
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:20,936
Tully's lawyer?
Do you know who reps him?

230
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,063
Yeah, I know.

231
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:26,817
Landman and Zack!
Landman and mother-freakin' Zack, man!

232
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:30,070
Ooh, sounds impressive.
Are they looking to hire?

233
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:32,740
Oh, you wouldn't be happy.
We used to intern there.

234
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:34,116
Oh, right.

235
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,118
And they offered us a job, a great job.

236
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:40,080
Which we turned down to go off
and save the world. Now they hate us.

237
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:42,366
We'll need to load for bear
if we're gonna take them on.

238
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,669
I'll hit the precinct to
check for complaints against Tully.

239
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:46,504
I can't go to L and Z alone.

240
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:50,049
They're gonna shark attack me, Matt.
Look at me, I'm delicious.

241
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,509
Well, take Karen.

242
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:56,013
I mean, yeah, if she wants to.

243
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:57,347
Oh...

244
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:58,766
sure.

245
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,726
Never seen sharks feed up close before.

246
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,855
Try not to splash too much.
It attracts 'em.

247
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:08,192
You both are so funny.

248
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,079
Look who it is... Murdock.

249
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,915
Sergeant... how's your mom?

250
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:25,918
Smells like a stogie. Otherwise, um...

251
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:29,755
Yeah, I keep telling Foggy
not to get her cigars, but...

252
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,217
She'd sneak 'em one way or the other.
Crafty old bird.

253
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,385
Right, it's why I'm here.

254
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,304
Friend of hers
has a case we're looking into.

255
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:39,348
You going after Tully?

256
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,475
Yeah, you know him?

257
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,478
Yeah. Yeah, guy's a real scumbag.

258
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:46,606
But he stays just this side of ordinance,
so there's nothing we can do.

259
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,190
Can you pull some copies
of the complaints?

260
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,109
Maybe get me a minute or two
with the officers who took them?

261
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:51,611
You really think you and Foggy can help?

262
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:53,112
Yeah, we can try.

263
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:55,698
Let me see what I can find.

264
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,116
Thank you.

265
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:15,134
Now, I just want you
to tell me again how did it start.

266
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:19,221
We have you at the scene
with a dead Chinese illegal, Piotr.

267
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,598
And a backpack full of drugs.

268
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:24,810
Uh-oh, that'll buy you a one-way ticket
to 30 years in Asshole Land.

269
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:27,146
It'll give you some time
to touch up on those tattoos.

270
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:28,606
You boys do that to yourselves

271
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:30,775
or do you all get shirtless
and poke each other?

272
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:32,568
Do you know who I work for?

273
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,279
Couple of dipshit brothers
nobody gives a wank about.

274
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:39,617
Bye-bye, dickhead. Enjoy your next 30.

275
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,036
Wait.

276
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,625
What if I give you another name?

277
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,002
Give you another name?

278
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:51,461
He'd have to be big.

279
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:53,380
He'd have to be King freakin' Kong.

280
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,677
He is.

281
00:22:58,928 --> 00:23:00,304
His name...

282
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:05,392
is Wilson Fisk.

283
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:06,769
Wilson Fisk.

284
00:23:17,237 --> 00:23:20,324
- Well, what else you know about this guy?
- Not much.

285
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:24,745
No one even supposed to say his name.

286
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:28,082
But I will tell you everything I know...
for deal.

287
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:30,835
"For deal."

288
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,929
- Whose turn is it?
- Yours.

289
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,557
I thought I took it
for that thing in the bodega?

290
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:46,767
Oh, shit, yeah.

291
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:49,812
All right, wait, wait.

292
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:53,273
Okay, go on.

293
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:54,900
Go on.

294
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:58,070
Watch out! Jeez, he's going for my gun!

295
00:23:58,153 --> 00:23:59,363
Watch out!

296
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:02,407
He's got my gun!

297
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:04,619
You really shouldn't have said his name.

298
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:18,716
We got shots fired...

299
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:25,890
God!

300
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:31,311
Feels like a place in a movie
where you'd buy a clone...

301
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:33,230
or maybe a robot baby.

302
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:36,397
Or the clone of a robot baby.

303
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:41,280
I'm Foggy Nelson. I called earlier.
I represent Ms. Cardenas.

304
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:42,990
Foggy Bear!

305
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:44,909
Look at you, still playing lawyer.

306
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:46,326
What are you doing here?

307
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,704
Working on making partner.
Marci Stahl.

308
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,706
Uh, Karen Page.

309
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,430
Wait, you work here, at Landman and Zack?

310
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:54,960
Mmm, came on right after
you and Murdock crashed and burned.

311
00:24:55,044 --> 00:24:56,605
- We didn't...
- Where is your sidekick?

312
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:58,472
Didn't break it off with him already,
did you?

313
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:01,258
- Fog has commitment issues.
- I don't have...

314
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:03,552
Matt is taking care of something.

315
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,554
It was very nice to see you.
We have an appointment.

316
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,556
I know. It's with me.

317
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,935
You're Armand Tully's lawyer?

318
00:25:11,018 --> 00:25:14,479
Just part of the team.
They're all tied up with real work, so...

319
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:16,816
All right, let's go upstairs and...

320
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:19,694
Oh, we'd be finished
before the elevator stopped.

321
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:23,447
Your client can agree to a buyout
or live in squalor till she's evicted.

322
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:27,993
Those workmen acted illegally.
They busted the place up.

323
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:30,245
They were making requested repairs.

324
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,831
- Which they never finished.
- Yeah.

325
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,166
- And did Mrs. Carnitas tell you...
- Cardenas.

326
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:39,671
Did she tell you why the workmen
left before completing the repairs?

327
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:42,717
- No, she just said...
- They feared for their safety.

328
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,677
- From an old woman?
- From a criminal element.

329
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:49,139
Her building is filled
with junkies and drug dealers.

330
00:25:49,223 --> 00:25:51,767
We're doing the city a favor
by trying to renovate.

331
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:52,893
You know that's not true.

332
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:55,771
Yeah, because the law's
always about the truth.

333
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,941
Look, you know how this goes.

334
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,860
It's her word versus my client's,

335
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:04,071
and there's a whole backlog of these cases
pending throughout the city.

336
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:06,406
No one is going to help her but us.

337
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:10,535
If I were you,
I'd go to Mrs. Whatever today

338
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:13,622
and strongly urge her to accept our offer.

339
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,375
Marci.

340
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:22,381
Convincing my client
to agree to your terms... that's your job.

341
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:23,632
And I'm not going to do it for you.

342
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,509
See, you think there are only two options.

343
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:28,804
These tenants take the payout and leave,
or leave without taking it.

344
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:31,140
But given how long
they've put up with Tully's bullshit,

345
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,100
I think you're actually afraid

346
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:37,687
that Mrs. Cardenas and her neighbors
will find a way to eke by.

347
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:39,857
And short of physically

348
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,734
and very illegally forcing tenants
from their rent-controlled homes...

349
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:44,862
Armand Tully loses his condos.

350
00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:47,156
Your firm loses Tully.

351
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,616
And that's very bad for business.

352
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:52,577
You want me and my client to think
that you're doing us a favor,

353
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:53,788
that we have no leverage.

354
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:55,747
When really, we have all of it.

355
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:58,793
So you're gonna see us in court...

356
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:01,628
where I will absolutely dismantle you,

357
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:05,257
from the top of your salon blowout
to the bottom of your overpriced pumps.

358
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:11,471
You would've killed it here, Foggy Bear.

359
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:14,558
You never should have left.

360
00:27:15,142 --> 00:27:17,644
You never should have signed on, Marce.

361
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:20,480
You were really something,
back in the day.

362
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:21,941
When you had a soul.

363
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:25,444
Foggy Bear?

364
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:27,237
We used to date.

365
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:28,488
You dated that?

366
00:27:28,572 --> 00:27:31,033
- Yep, let's step a little faster.
- Oh, my God.

367
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:39,416
They're taking statements
from Blake and Hoffman.

368
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:42,837
Our contacts in IAB will make it go away.

369
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:46,590
Had there been someone else in that room
with that Russian...

370
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:48,968
There wasn't.

371
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:50,344
It was our people.

372
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:51,720
This time.

373
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:56,851
Soon Vladimir won't have any comrades
to whisper your name to.

374
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,106
Is there anything else?

375
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,318
The '75 Brunello di Montalcino.

376
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,989
It's a personal favorite.

377
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,908
Thank you, Wesley.

378
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:42,104
Jesus.

379
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:51,530
Señor Tully...

380
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:54,074
fix?

381
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:57,119
No, not yet.

382
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,165
But Karen and I,
we're going to do what we can.

383
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:02,457
We are?

384
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,793
Why not?

385
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:08,297
My dad owned a hardware store
for 12 forevers, picked up a few things.

386
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,580
At least get the ball rolling.

387
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:12,259
- And your cousin's a drywall guy, right?
- That he is.

388
00:29:12,342 --> 00:29:15,345
And Matt and I fished an electrician
out of the drunk tank.

389
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:16,931
Owes us a favor.

390
00:29:17,014 --> 00:29:19,224
We're gonna talk to your neighbors, too,
okay, Mrs. Cardenas?

391
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:20,809
We're gonna take care of you.

392
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,247
Ahhh!

393
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:47,836
Scream and that arm
becomes your good one.

394
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,213
We clear?

395
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,132
You killed that Russian in interrogation.

396
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:53,696
I had no choice,
he jumped my partner.

397
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,720
You lie to me and I hurt you.

398
00:29:56,803 --> 00:29:59,639
You killed him 'cause he said a name,
Wilson Fisk.

399
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:01,283
I don't know what you're talking about.

400
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,518
Okay, okay!

401
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:08,648
I shot him 'cause he said a name, so what?

402
00:30:08,732 --> 00:30:10,413
What I hear,
you like to kill Russians too.

403
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:12,486
You chopped Anatoly's head off.

404
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,696
And now I want his brother.

405
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:16,906
I don't know where he is!

406
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:22,287
I swear! I swear! I swear! Please. Please.

407
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:30,772
How are Fisk and the Russians connected?

408
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,256
Why did he kill Prohaszka for them?

409
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,841
Why?

410
00:30:34,924 --> 00:30:36,676
You don't know?

411
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,970
Oh, man.

412
00:30:38,928 --> 00:30:41,223
You really are one stupid son of a bitch,
aren't you?

413
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:57,406
- Good evening, madam.
- Hello.

414
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:59,116
This way, please.

415
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,547
I didn't know if you would show.

416
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,132
Neither did I.

417
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,111
I thought you didn't go in
for grand gestures.

418
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,761
No, it isn't...

419
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:22,972
I didn't want to be interrupted again.

420
00:31:23,057 --> 00:31:25,475
We can go somewhere else if you like.

421
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,020
And if I just want
to walk out that door by myself?

422
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,855
Then I would dine alone.

423
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,400
It wouldn't be the first time.

424
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,030
I've been lied to before... by men.

425
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,826
Some were even decent ones...

426
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:45,995
but they still felt the need
to be dishonest...

427
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:49,208
about things that mattered.

428
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:56,381
Do you feel that need... Wilson?

429
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:01,678
I don't like to be in public.

430
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,475
And I don't like to be questioned.

431
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:11,563
But you can ask me anything, Vanessa.

432
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,234
And I will always be honest with you.

433
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:20,239
Let's start with something simple.

434
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,452
What are we drinking?

435
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:33,960
Marcel...

436
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:38,798
the '75 Brunello di Montalcino.

437
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:05,492
Hey, sorry about your...

438
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:10,830
Just... sorry, you know?

439
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,709
Sergei tells me you know something.

440
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:18,963
Something about the man
who took my brother from me.

441
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:21,258
Yeah, uh...

442
00:33:23,843 --> 00:33:28,807
Look, I know this guy,
we did a stretch in Rikers.

443
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:32,686
Getting by now at a chop shop
on the edge of the Kitchen.

444
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,272
Told me an SUV came in yesterday.

445
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:38,066
Black... expensive...

446
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,611
backseat all splattered with blood and...

447
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,658
brains.

448
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,377
This car...
who does it belong to?

449
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:01,005
Some big white guy...

450
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:02,257
bald as shit.

451
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:06,595
- Fisk?
- Didn't get a name, but...

452
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,555
my boy said

453
00:34:08,638 --> 00:34:12,267
he heard baldy say something
about that guy in the black mask.

454
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:15,229
Couldn't make it all out...

455
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:19,191
but sounds like
he and this mask dude are tight.

456
00:34:20,317 --> 00:34:21,568
He works for Fisk.

457
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:25,655
All this time,
Fisk has been playing us...

458
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,617
planning this.

459
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:34,080
Tell the men to pull back and get ready.

460
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:37,626
Guns, rifles, grenades. All of it.

461
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:38,710
All?

462
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:45,634
Turk, spread the word on the streets...

463
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:49,763
1 million for whoever can tell me
where I can find Fisk...

464
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:51,014
tonight.

465
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:52,432
1 mil?

466
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:56,728
Shit... I'm on it!

467
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,535
We will honor you, my brother...

468
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:16,415
with the blood of war.

469
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,627
Okay, try it now.

470
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,717
Okay, yeah!

471
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,469
I admit it. I'm impressed.

472
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:33,181
Hot still doesn't work,
but at least it's a start.

473
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:39,563
You, Señor Foggy, you...

474
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:41,356
You stay, we eat.

475
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,358
- No, Mrs. Cardenas...
- You stay.

476
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,527
There is no "no happen," okay?

477
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:50,156
- You want to eat?
- Be rude not to.

478
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,868
Mi madre make this,
all the time in Guatemala.

479
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:58,623
Now I make para ustedes, como gracias.

480
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:02,210
Mrs. Cardenas, where did you make this?
You don't have any gas.

481
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:05,088
I cook in apartamento downstairs.

482
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,925
Aquí, we take care for another.

483
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:21,020
Did she just...

484
00:36:21,104 --> 00:36:23,357
Did she... Is this a date?

485
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,566
Uh...

486
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,446
I sort of think it is, Señor Foggy.

487
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:38,788
There're no numbers in this...
no contacts.

488
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:41,541
It's a burner.
Like the one I use to talk to you.

489
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:44,229
It was buzzing.
Did someone leave a message?

490
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:45,504
Um...

491
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:47,213
No, a text.

492
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:49,090
What's it say?

493
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,593
It's a list of locations.

494
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:52,927
Four of them.

495
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:56,222
47th and 12th. 48th and 9th.

496
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:59,893
42nd and 10th. 44th and 11th.

497
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:02,061
- 44th and 11th?
- Yeah.

498
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,189
Troika Restaurant.

499
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:06,595
Where they were holding that boy?

500
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:09,027
These addresses,
they're listing where the Russians are.

501
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:12,071
- The hell did you get this?
- Cop.

502
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:16,034
- I said go to the police, I didn't mean...
- Nah, he was working for Fisk.

503
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:17,744
Killed a Russian for him,
right inside the precinct.

504
00:37:17,827 --> 00:37:19,579
Then later he gets that list of addresses.

505
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:22,040
I'm betting I'll find Vladimir
at one of them.

506
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:24,125
Matt, wait, just...

507
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:27,045
What are you going to do?

508
00:37:27,754 --> 00:37:29,088
Whatever it takes.

509
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,466
You know how that sounds, right?

510
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:39,057
Um, when we were on that roof
you told that Russian...

511
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,519
that you hurt people because you enjoy it.

512
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:44,646
And you said you didn't believe that.

513
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,731
I can't believe that.

514
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:49,901
Because if I do,
that means you're not the man...

515
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:51,110
that I believe you to be.

516
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:52,904
I need to be the man this city needs.

517
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,739
Hey, that's not a reason, it's an excuse.

518
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:56,450
What do you want me to do, Claire?

519
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,117
Let them tear Hell's Kitchen apart?

520
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:01,079
Let them win?

521
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:06,250
What you do is important...
to so many people. I get that.

522
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:14,133
I just don't think I can let myself
fall in love with someone...

523
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:18,722
who's so damn close
to becoming what he hates.

524
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,725
You're right...

525
00:38:24,728 --> 00:38:26,354
you shouldn't.

526
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:41,620
A prince?

527
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:43,538
I didn't know he was one at first.

528
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:47,876
He saw me at an exhibition.
I was the curator and traveling with it...

529
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,003
and all of a sudden...

530
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:54,508
this tall man in a white suit
and an ascot...

531
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,425
An ascot? That's a bit much.

532
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,802
That's what I was thinking.

533
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,557
He sidles up to me...
I love that word, "sidle."

534
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:08,605
and he says, "You are more beautiful
than any painting here."

535
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:12,567
I knew it was a line, but it worked.

536
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,027
I slept with him.

537
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:20,784
Does that shock you?

538
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:29,333
You're a very attractive woman.
I assumed you've had lovers.

539
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:30,627
That's not what I asked.

540
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,128
No, it didn't shock me.

541
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:34,548
Then why'd you look away?

542
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:38,718
Because I wish I had said something
like that to you when we first met.

543
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,056
I'm glad you didn't.

544
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,817
This wine's even better than the last one.

545
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,484
Did you pick it?

546
00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:59,906
I've never had it. My assistant.

547
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:05,244
I said I'd be honest.

548
00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:06,580
You did.

549
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:10,124
Wesley's more than an assistant...

550
00:40:12,001 --> 00:40:13,377
he's my friend.

551
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:14,671
So you do have those.

552
00:40:16,255 --> 00:40:20,885
Yet the man says he was lonely
when he looked at my painting.

553
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:22,428
My painting.

554
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,684
Yes.

555
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,394
Thank you.

556
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:35,734
So why does a man like you feel alone?

557
00:40:36,943 --> 00:40:38,444
Nature of my business, I suppose.

558
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:42,240
And what kind of business is that?

559
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,662
Rebuilding this city.

560
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:52,041
I want to carve something beautiful
out of its ugliness...

561
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,835
set free its potential.

562
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:55,879
You sound like an artist.

563
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:58,172
I'm just a man with a dream.

564
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,549
What do you think an artist is?

565
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:04,095
Are those the only ones you have?

566
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:06,848
You were wearing them last time.

567
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,143
They were my father's.

568
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:14,105
I wear them every day to remember him.

569
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,316
Did he pass?

570
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,152
When I was a boy.

571
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:23,823
May I ask you something now?

572
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:26,826
I'd say you've earned it.

573
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,623
What kind of gun is that
you have in your purse?

574
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:41,841
It's a .22.

575
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,094
Did you think you would need that tonight?

576
00:41:46,345 --> 00:41:49,182
We've been sitting here talking
for hours...

577
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:55,354
and you're going to insult me
like I have no idea what you really do?

578
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:58,733
What I said...

579
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:02,403
about what I want for this city
is the truth.

580
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:09,744
But money and influence is not enough
to usher change on such a scale.

581
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,245
Sometimes it requires force.

582
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,416
I know you're a dangerous man.

583
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:20,672
That's why I brought a gun
to a dinner date.

584
00:42:22,631 --> 00:42:23,800
Would you like to leave?

585
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:24,926
No...

586
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:28,012
I'd like a reason to stay.

587
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,775
I've done things
that I'm not proud of, Vanessa.

588
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:46,781
I've hurt people...
and I'm going to hurt more.

589
00:42:49,575 --> 00:42:52,829
It's impossible to avoid
for what I'm trying to do.

590
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:56,207
But I take no pleasure in it...

591
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,127
in cruelty.

592
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:03,089
But this city isn't a caterpillar.

593
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:06,259
It doesn't spin a cocoon
and wake up a butterfly.

594
00:43:07,176 --> 00:43:11,973
A city... crumbles and fades.

595
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:18,021
It needs to die before it can be reborn.

596
00:43:22,025 --> 00:43:23,985
So I don't need the gun?

597
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,990
No, by my side...

598
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:32,952
is the safest place
that you could ever be.

599
00:44:16,662 --> 00:44:17,956
Vladimir...

600
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,666
Turk just got a call.
We know where Fisk is.

601
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,770
Tell the men...

602
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:25,129
and no one touches Fisk.

603
00:44:25,213 --> 00:44:26,214
He is mine.

604
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:31,510
And Matt bangs his cane around
and says,

605
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,638
"Am I in the right room?"

606
00:44:34,722 --> 00:44:37,225
- Where did you put his furniture?
- Dorm room across the hall.

607
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,018
Oh, God!

608
00:44:39,102 --> 00:44:41,229
Oh, I really wish
I knew you guys back then.

609
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:42,981
Much better off knowing us now.

610
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:44,858
We have our own practice.

611
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:47,986
I'm a hell of a lot more dashing
than I was in my awkward college days.

612
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:51,697
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going to need
photographic proof of that, counselor.

613
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,660
I have dug myself another hole, haven't I?

614
00:44:56,744 --> 00:44:58,829
Well, it's been about five minutes.
You were due.

615
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:00,831
Yeah. Yeah, I see that.

616
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:04,335
You know, there's something I gotta know.
It's killing me.

617
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:08,547
No, I do not kiss on the first date.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

618
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:09,966
No! No.

619
00:45:12,426 --> 00:45:15,846
What's the deal with the meat grinder
in the pencil skirt?

620
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,016
No, she just...
She doesn't seem like your type.

621
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:19,558
- Marci?
- Yeah.

622
00:45:21,435 --> 00:45:23,854
She was different back when I knew her.

623
00:45:24,813 --> 00:45:27,233
Or maybe she wasn't, I don't know.

624
00:45:27,316 --> 00:45:29,485
Matt's always getting involved
with the wrong girl,

625
00:45:29,568 --> 00:45:31,988
so maybe he just rubbed off on me.

626
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,114
Huh.

627
00:45:34,323 --> 00:45:35,950
Matt dates a lot?

628
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,076
Date?

629
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,245
I wouldn't exactly call it that.

630
00:45:40,163 --> 00:45:42,643
He hasn't really been with anyone
for more than a month or two.

631
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,167
Hmm.

632
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:46,794
It's kind of sad.

633
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,631
On the plus side,
he gets to touch a lot of pretty girls...

634
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,300
on their faces.

635
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:55,929
Um, that's, you know,
how he tells what people look like.

636
00:45:56,012 --> 00:45:58,389
Or at least that's
what he tells the ladies.

637
00:45:58,472 --> 00:46:00,849
Although, he always seems
to know which ones are hot

638
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:03,436
before he puts his
grubby little mitts on them.

639
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,855
It's a real gift.
He's like a sexual Rain Man.

640
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:10,651
Does he know what you look like?

641
00:46:11,694 --> 00:46:13,529
He's got a rough idea.

642
00:46:14,613 --> 00:46:16,950
I only ever let him
put his hands on my face once,

643
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:18,742
'cause... weird.

644
00:46:20,786 --> 00:46:22,246
Are you gonna finish that?

645
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,497
No, no.

646
00:46:27,876 --> 00:46:29,920
You ever tell him what I look like?

647
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:32,881
No, he doesn't need me to tell him...

648
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,930
He's probably got
a picture of you in his head.

649
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:42,350
- I don't like to mess with those.
- Oh...

650
00:46:45,478 --> 00:46:46,854
Hey, Foggy...

651
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:52,818
I want you to touch my face.

652
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,573
Um... but I can see you, so...

653
00:46:57,656 --> 00:47:00,201
No, I... No, I know. I just, um...

654
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:06,374
I want to know how someone
who's blind would see me.

655
00:47:09,668 --> 00:47:12,130
Look, you do me then, then I'll do you.

656
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,799
Yeah, okay.

657
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:30,898
Delivery. Gao.

658
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:17,421
The men are ready at the other locations?

659
00:48:17,445 --> 00:48:18,696
They're waiting for the call.

660
00:48:21,157 --> 00:48:22,283
Make it.

661
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,251
We expecting another delivery from Gao?

662
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:53,439
You have to close your eyes.

663
00:48:53,522 --> 00:48:54,690
Right.

664
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:02,072
Just tell me what you feel.

665
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:10,623
Jesus, are you okay?

666
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:15,794
Foggy...

667
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,590
We have to stop the bleeding.

668
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:27,640
What is happening?

669
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:32,520
- Stay with her.
- Yeah.

670
00:49:34,613 --> 00:49:36,333
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

671
00:49:36,357 --> 00:49:37,858
See if anyone else needs help.
I'll be right back.

672
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,193
Foggy...

673
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:56,169
Oh, my God...

674
00:49:59,046 --> 00:50:00,256
Wilson?

675
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,802
Did you read about the boy...

676
00:50:04,885 --> 00:50:08,306
who watched his father
being pulled from their car and beaten,

677
00:50:08,389 --> 00:50:09,848
before the boy was taken?

678
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:14,562
The men that did that...

679
00:50:15,896 --> 00:50:18,482
they will no longer infect this city.

680
00:50:27,032 --> 00:50:28,284
Good.

681
00:50:35,374 --> 00:50:37,167
We should call it a night.

682
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:39,295
I need to get you home
before the roads close.

683
00:50:39,378 --> 00:50:40,504
Marcel?

684
00:50:43,048 --> 00:50:44,550
Your car is ready, sir.

685
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:46,302
Yes, just one more thing...

686
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:54,227
I want to give you this.

687
00:50:55,394 --> 00:50:57,635
Thank you for everything
you've done for me this evening.

688
00:50:58,439 --> 00:51:00,608
For making this call for me, especially.

689
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:02,360
A pleasure as always, sir.

690
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:53,577
Vladimir!

691
00:51:55,162 --> 00:51:56,455
Vladimir!

692
00:51:58,707 --> 00:52:00,000
Vladimir!

693
00:52:04,963 --> 00:52:06,484
We must go! Quickly.

694
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:12,513
Never liked
those borscht eatin' bastards.

695
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:15,057
Paid shit for shit work.

696
00:52:16,392 --> 00:52:20,854
Although, Vlady did offer a cool mil
to give up your boy.

697
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:27,528
You're alive...
which means you made the right decision.

698
00:52:29,488 --> 00:52:33,659
Your conversation with Vladimir
caused him to react predictably.

699
00:52:34,577 --> 00:52:36,286
My employer is grateful for that.

700
00:52:37,162 --> 00:52:39,707
Hey, happy to help.

701
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,836
But why all that with plantin' the mask?

702
00:52:44,878 --> 00:52:48,090
Why not just blow 'em up from the start,
if that's what you were gonna do?

703
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:51,385
It takes time
to arrange something like this,

704
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,303
and help from friends.

705
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:58,476
We needed to keep Vladimir off balance
until everything was in place.

706
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:02,020
Right.

707
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,733
Got mad respect for a smart move.

708
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:09,945
You need anything else,
you know where to find me.

709
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:11,113
Hmm.

710
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,168
You are hurt.

711
00:53:25,252 --> 00:53:26,379
I will live.

712
00:53:26,462 --> 00:53:31,341
And see Fisk and his masked dog
pay for what they did.

713
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,882
This one's for Claire.

714
00:53:58,243 --> 00:53:59,912
Hands in the air!

715
00:53:59,995 --> 00:54:01,705
Raise those hands!

716
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:02,831
Don't move! Raise 'em!

717
00:54:02,915 --> 00:54:04,332
Hands in the air, now!

718
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:10,464
Check the two on the ground.
Suspect is in custody.

719
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:12,215
On the ground now,
you son of a bitch.

720
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:21,152
