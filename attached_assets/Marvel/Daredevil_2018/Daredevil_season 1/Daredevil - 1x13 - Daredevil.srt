00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,841
[soulful music playing]

2
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,123
[inaudible]

3
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:49,060
[theme music playing]

4
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:57,086
[sniffling] Give me a minute, okay?

5
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,300
Mrs. Urich?

6
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:06,887
Um... I'm Karen.

7
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,890
Karen Page. I don't know if Ben ever...

8
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:12,601
Karen, yes.

9
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,645
He talked about you all the time.

10
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:16,981
He did?

11
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:19,150
He thought you were something else.

12
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:23,654
The way you wouldn't let go
until you got to the truth.

13
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,573
He admired that.

14
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:28,784
We never got around to having kids,

15
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:31,245
too busy with this or that, but...

16
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,208
if we had, I think he would
have wanted one like you.

17
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,920
[voice breaking] Mrs. Urich, I...

18
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:42,548
I think it's my fault...

19
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,176
what happened to Ben.

20
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,345
I pushed him into a story
that he didn't want...

21
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:52,433
Ben Urich never got pushed into
doing anything he didn't want to do.

22
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:55,144
He was a reporter.

23
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,147
That's what he lived for.

24
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:01,484
[voice breaking] And he
passed doing what he loved...

25
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:05,154
what he had to do.

26
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:07,240
We should be getting back.

27
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,620
It was nice to meet you, Karen.

28
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:14,580
Is there... Is there
anything that you need?

29
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:16,499
- Anything at all that I...
- No.

30
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:19,210
Ben's taken care of all that.

31
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:28,719
He took out a policy years back when
that river water story turned ugly.

32
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,681
He always took care of me.

33
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,685
[sobbing] Still is.

34
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:56,705
[Lantom] How you holding up?

35
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,750
Like a good Catholic boy.

36
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,252
That bad, huh?

37
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,004
He was a good man.

38
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:06,049
And he's gone...

39
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:10,969
because I haven't stopped
what's happening to this city.

40
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:14,390
[Lantom] Can't put that
on yourself, Matthew.

41
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:16,100
You've done everything you can.

42
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:19,645
A lot you probably shouldn't have.

43
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:22,190
And here we are.

44
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,926
[Karen] He just stood there,
like he was his friend.

45
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:52,928
Like he had nothing to
do with what happened.

46
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:54,722
I thought Ben said he
didn't have any evidence

47
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:56,432
Ellison was taking money from Fisk.

48
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:59,852
No, but it makes sense.
I mean, it explains...

49
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,271
[sighs]

50
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:07,443
Do you know what makes this worse?

51
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:10,113
Foggy.

52
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,032
Didn't even show up.

53
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,785
You said he left a message.

54
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,580
Yeah, he left a message...

55
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:22,666
saying he had something more important
to do than come to Ben's funeral.

56
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,127
Come on, he wouldn't say that.

57
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,296
- Yeah, well, it's what he meant.
- [Matt sighs]

58
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:30,048
It's my fault, Karen...

59
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:32,635
all of this with Foggy.

60
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:36,347
No, everyone shares the
blame in a relationship.

61
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,350
That's... just the way that it works.

62
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,810
No, not always.

63
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:45,606
Why don't you go home, get some rest, huh?

64
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:48,066
I can't.

65
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,903
[Karen sighs]

66
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:54,615
Every time I close my eyes, I see...

67
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,078
What if he finds out that I...

68
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,877
That I was with Ben...

69
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,254
at Saint Benezet.

70
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:10,173
What if he finds out that
I spoke to his mother too?

71
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:13,217
If that happens, we will deal with it.

72
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,385
How?

73
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:17,971
I mean, the news barely
mentioned what happened to Ben

74
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:21,058
because Fisk pays off the media.

75
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:22,685
And the police haven't
arrested anyone for it

76
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:25,521
because Fisk pays them off, too.

77
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:27,773
Foggy was right.

78
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:31,819
How do you stop someone like
that, someone who has so much?

79
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:34,405
It just means he has more to lose.

80
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,114
- He's gonna find out what I did.
- No.

81
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,866
He's going to find out,
and he's gonna come after me

82
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,202
just like he came after Ben.

83
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:41,537
I told you I would keep you safe, Karen...

84
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,122
when he came after you over
Union Allied. That hasn't changed.

85
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,585
Everyone that's taken money from him,

86
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,754
everyone that's helped
him tear this city apart...

87
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:55,843
they're all gonna get
what's coming to them...

88
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,428
along with Wilson Fisk.

89
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:10,983
[Vanessa] Wilson?

90
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,152
You should be in bed.

91
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:16,071
I was calling for you.

92
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:18,949
I'm sorry, I...

93
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,370
I didn't hear you.

94
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,288
[sighs]

95
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,335
Anything interesting?

96
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,213
Just a transfer of funds.

97
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:36,509
Wesley made the arrangements for
me to get you out of the country.

98
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:40,137
- You know I won't leave without you.
- I'm not asking.

99
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,768
I'm just reviewing them, and
then I'll move the funds back.

100
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,437
Is everything all right?

101
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:52,858
It's just the numbers, I...

102
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:56,904
I'll have Leland take a look at them...

103
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:00,574
well, just to make sure.

104
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:15,839
[Leland] Senator Cherryh's cleared
the last of the zoning hurdles...

105
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:20,511
after squeezing us for another extra 10%.

106
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:25,098
Bright side, you'll be able to build
whatever you want on your properties now.

107
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:28,561
Everyone's been paid
off, everyone's on board.

108
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:31,605
But we will need to find a
replacement for Gao's heroin trade.

109
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:33,816
Without it,

110
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,861
we might have some off-the-books
cash flow issues down the road.

111
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,533
What's the word on what happened with her?

112
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:43,992
Looks like she's in the wind.

113
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:49,873
Wouldn't have expected it, but maybe
she's not the ally we thought she was.

114
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,293
Mmm, maybe she's not.

115
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:59,132
What's this?

116
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:03,721
I asked Wesley to transfer funds
for me the night before we found him.

117
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,973
I thought financials was my job.

118
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,933
Yes, that's why I wanted
you to have a look at these.

119
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:11,520
There seem to be some
irregularities with my accounts.

120
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:16,484
Of course there are. I move
money around all the time.

121
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:21,238
It's a shell game to keep the
SEC off our backs, it's nothing.

122
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:28,454
Your hand's shaking.

123
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:31,999
[Leland scoffs] 'Cause
it's freezing out here.

124
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:34,418
Then why are you sweating, Leland?

125
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:41,842
[sighs] All right, okay, Jesus.

126
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,846
I figured you'd find out sooner or later.

127
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,351
What's a guy gonna do?

128
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:52,561
Wesley found out, didn't he?

129
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:55,773
He confronted you...

130
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:57,941
and you shot him.

131
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:02,154
I have no idea what happened to
Wesley. I wasn't a part of that.

132
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:05,366
But you had something to do
with the benefit, didn't you?

133
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:06,450
You and Gao?

134
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,912
She's gone, you're stealing from me.

135
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:11,414
It's not what you think.

136
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:13,165
You tried to kill me.

137
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,959
[sighs]

138
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,756
The poisonings at the benefit

139
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,428
were just to make it look like
someone was trying to get at you.

140
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:27,555
But you were never the target.

141
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,475
[inhales sharply] Vanessa?

142
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,977
Do you blame us?

143
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:38,774
Just look at what's happened
since you took up with her.

144
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:43,487
[sighs] You've been
distracted, emotional, erratic.

145
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:46,490
We just wanted to nudge you back on track.

146
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,826
But...

147
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:54,247
obviously that went south, so...

148
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,250
we will be parting ways...

149
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:01,922
and I'll be taking half
your assets with me.

150
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:06,426
[yelling] You think that I would let
you walk away after what you've done?

151
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,472
That's exactly what you're gonna do,

152
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:12,265
because I have Detective Hoffman.

153
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:17,395
Hoffman never left the city after he
murdered his partner in the hospital.

154
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,733
I scooped him up, squirreled
him away for a rainy day.

155
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,528
If I don't check in every 24 hours...

156
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:28,240
Hoffman gets dropped off to the Feds...

157
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,619
tells them all the shit he's been up to.

158
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:33,286
Hoffman, he's...

159
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:37,249
he's a frightened little worm.

160
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:40,127
He would never risk going against me.

161
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,630
Ten million buys a lot of courage.

162
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,091
He thinks he's going
into witness protection,

163
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:47,801
get the money on the other side.

164
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:50,513
Now, I know you'll get to
him before he cashes in,

165
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:53,974
but by then the damage will
already have been done...

166
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:59,312
and everything you've been fighting
so hard for will come tumbling down.

167
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:02,733
Yeah, but you would get
caught up in that as well.

168
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:05,360
I've spent my entire life...

169
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,698
hiding assets overseas for pricks like you.

170
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:15,579
My son and I will be
just another transaction,

171
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:18,999
disappearing into the tax-exempt ether.

172
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,627
But I'm a fair sort.

173
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,047
That's why I'm only taking half your money.

174
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,634
You go your way, I go mine.

175
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:31,219
Not what I'd call win-win...

176
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:34,932
but it's as close as
we're gonna get with this.

177
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:36,934
So...

178
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,063
we on the same page?

179
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:42,272
I, uh...

180
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:45,483
No...

181
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,110
I don't think we are.

182
00:13:48,737 --> 00:13:50,739
- [Taser buzzing]
- [screams]

183
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:55,035
[groans]

184
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:58,622
You hurt her!

185
00:13:58,706 --> 00:13:59,832
Wait, wait!

186
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,585
You hurt Vanessa!

187
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,718
[Fisk breathing heavily]

188
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:22,771
Sweep the city.

189
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:25,816
Find Hoffman and put a bullet in his head.

190
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,527
[grunting]

191
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:48,546
[panting]

192
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:54,136
How'd you know I was here?

193
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,264
Known about your outlet for a while.

194
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:00,976
I didn't say anything because I thought
it had something to do with your dad.

195
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:02,728
Now I know better.

196
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:05,981
[grunting]

197
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:10,027
Thought you'd be out punching people
in the head, or whatever you do.

198
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:14,239
I was. Paid Ben's editor a visit.

199
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:16,283
- Ellison?
- Yeah.

200
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:18,493
Karen thinks he's working for Fisk.

201
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:19,577
Did he talk?

202
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:22,497
[panting] No, never got close.

203
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,669
Wife and kid picked him
up outside the office.

204
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,461
Try it again tomorrow night.

205
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:39,097
Looking like you have some anger
issues. Wanna talk about it?

206
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:41,308
You're not my priest, Foggy...

207
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,645
who you might have met if you'd
shown up for Ben's funeral.

208
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:46,188
Karen upset?

209
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:54,029
I told her this was my fault...

210
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:55,572
all of this between you and me.

211
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,619
[sighs] I just nodded.

212
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:03,789
You could tell that, right?

213
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:05,708
Yeah, I could tell.

214
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,714
I was on my way to the
service and I got a call...

215
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:12,881
from Marci.

216
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:14,007
From Marci?

217
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:16,760
She's been helping me...

218
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:19,554
copying files from Landman
and Zack on the quiet.

219
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:22,224
Whole stack of documents
on their dealings with Fisk,

220
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:24,351
- and Owlsley at Silver and Brent.
- [slams fist]

221
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:27,395
Ben is dead, Foggy, because
he got dragged into this.

222
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,897
And now you're doing the same with your ex.

223
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:31,274
- We're being careful.
- This has to stop.

224
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,818
Fisk has to...

225
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:38,866
I have to stop this...

226
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:42,995
before there's no one left to bury.

227
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:44,537
Matt...

228
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:45,622
Matt!

229
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:49,710
Last time you went after
Fisk, I found you half dead!

230
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,086
More than half.

231
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:55,215
You go after him in the mask
again, he might kill you.

232
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:56,717
Or you might kill him,

233
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,469
which would probably have the same
effect on someone as Catholic as you are.

234
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,388
What am I supposed to do?

235
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:03,724
How do I stop him?

236
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,726
By using the law, Matt.

237
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:10,313
Like you told me and Karen to
do. That's how we take him down.

238
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:12,858
We?

239
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,820
Thought Nelson and Murdock were over.

240
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:24,577
There's nothing I want more than to
find a way back to where we were, but...

241
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:27,164
[sighs]

242
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,581
I don't know if we can.

243
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,084
No, we can't.

244
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:36,714
But maybe we can find a
way to move forward, Foggy.

245
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:42,429
Things are bad enough around here.

246
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:45,057
Last thing I need is to be seen
chumming it up with the enemy.

247
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,934
Especially ones bringing cigars for my mom.

248
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:48,143
These are the good ones.

249
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:49,895
So all the other times
you were buying cheap?

250
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:51,772
How are things bad? What's going on?

251
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:54,191
You hear about that warehouse
fire a few days back?

252
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,901
[Foggy] That Chinese place?
[Brett] Yeah, it turns out

253
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:58,361
it was full of illegal immigrants
and a shit ton of heroin.

254
00:17:58,445 --> 00:17:59,737
And that guy in the mask was there.

255
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,156
I had a run-in with him leaving the scene.

256
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:03,200
- What happened?
- I got my ass beat.

257
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:06,161
But this guy, I mean, I don't know,
what he said, it got me thinking.

258
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:09,706
- I heard he has that effect on people.
- He was working with Ben Urich.

259
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,208
How do you know that?

260
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,211
Because we were working with
Ben, too, on the same story.

261
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,588
Where are you with the
investigation? Any leads?

262
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:18,340
You know I can't be
talking to you about that.

263
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:21,509
Story Ben was working
on was about Wilson Fisk.

264
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:23,136
[Brett] Yeah, the man in
the mask talked about him.

265
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,260
He said half the cops in
the 15th are in his pocket.

266
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,306
You believe him?

267
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:28,391
No, I've seen things make me wonder.

268
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,352
Ben found Fisk's mom.

269
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:32,270
Told him some things Fisk
wouldn't want out there.

270
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:33,771
And you think he killed him for it?

271
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,648
Does it match up with
anything you can't tell us?

272
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:38,026
[Brett] No, no, forensics couldn't
pull a single print at the scene.

273
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,319
Not even Urich's.

274
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:42,239
All his files and notebooks are
gone, hard drives wiped clean.

275
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:44,741
Fisk's mom got the same treatment.

276
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:47,785
Gone, no record of her at the
care facility Ben found her at.

277
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:52,290
Looking for you inside, Sarge.

278
00:18:52,374 --> 00:18:54,960
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be in in a minute.
- [officer] Yeah, I'm still here.

279
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:56,544
Give me the rest of it.

280
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,891
[Brett] I've been gone ten minutes
and already they're looking for me.

281
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,385
[officer] Christ, I thought he
was at the bottom of the river.

282
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:06,179
I'll reach out to the C.I.'s,
see if anybody's got a line.

283
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:10,308
Owlsley has Hoffman stashed in the
city. We'll find the little rat shit.

284
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:11,726
[Brett] Look, I gotta get back.

285
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,562
- Nothing else you can give us?
- No, I've said too much already!

286
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:16,356
And this guy isn't even listening.

287
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,649
- Just standing there, man.
- I'm sorry.

288
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,026
What were you saying?

289
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,818
It don't matter. The way
things are going around here,

290
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:22,946
I'm thinking about taking an early pension.

291
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,447
Move my mom somewhere warm.

292
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,074
Be a shame.

293
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:28,243
The only cop on the force
we know for sure is honest.

294
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:30,328
Never see Serpico?

295
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:34,249
Honest cops are usually the
ones get shot in the face.

296
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:36,626
- Another dead end.
- No, it wasn't.

297
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,129
The cop on the phone, I had a
run-in with him before in the mask.

298
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,505
He works for Fisk?

299
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:43,508
He was talking to someone about
Hoffman. They're looking for him.

300
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,427
Detective Hoffman? He's alive?

301
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,470
From what I could tell, Owlsley
has him holed up somewhere.

302
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,806
Fisk wants him found, bad.

303
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,559
Hell yeah, he does. Hoffman
could blow this thing wide open.

304
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:54,769
Only if we get to him first.

305
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,564
[Foggy sighs]

306
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:01,859
You know what doesn't make you
want to gouge your eyes out?

307
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:05,280
Cold cuts, Italian meats, cheeses.

308
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,615
Why did I become a lawyer again?

309
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,159
To make lots of money.

310
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,410
[laughs]

311
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:12,516
That didn't work out so good, did it?

312
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,122
[chuckles] Not so much.

313
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:15,958
Could have had my own deli,

314
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,335
an apron with my name on it and everything.

315
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,088
- [Karen chuckles]
- What?

316
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:24,591
Oh, it's just this. It's
the way it should be.

317
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:26,884
What, Foggy talking about cured meats?

318
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:29,637
[chuckles] Nelson and Murdock.

319
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:31,974
It's a start.

320
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:35,768
Uh, you, uh, find anything?

321
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:39,856
Well, there's thousands
and thousands of pages, I...

322
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:43,401
How'd Marci even get this out of
Landman and Zack without anyone noticing?

323
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:46,363
She can be very... distracting.

324
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,365
- Hmm, I bet.
- [chuckles]

325
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,700
Concentrate on anything
pertaining to Silver and Brent.

326
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,577
Uh, liens, development, property holdings,

327
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,100
anything that might point to
where Owlsley is holding Hoffman.

328
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,915
The corruption, the bombings,
the cops that got shot,

329
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,084
Hoffman knows it all.

330
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:02,379
He turns, it won't just bring Fisk down.

331
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,923
It'll prove your man in the mask isn't
the asshole everyone thinks he is.

332
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:09,052
You really think he'll go
against Fisk, even if we find him?

333
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:12,222
A lot of friction between Fisk and the
other players he's been working with.

334
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,390
[inhales sharply]

335
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:15,683
Bombed the hell out of the Russians,
the Yakuza went underground,

336
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,811
Chinese heroin went up in flames.
Now Owlsley's making a move.

337
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:20,813
You don't get to be the man on top

338
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:24,276
without making enemies
looking to tear you down.

339
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:28,613
It's just something Ben told me.

340
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:31,074
He's right. You don't.

341
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:37,539
So how'd you find out about
Owlsley? You never said.

342
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:39,249
[Foggy stammers]

343
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,543
Your... pal in the mask.

344
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,920
You saw him?

345
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:45,963
Oh, my God. When? Where?

346
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:49,551
[stammering] You know the alley down by...

347
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:50,843
- [Matt] At the alley by the, um...
- Yeah.

348
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:52,512
Where we used to, um...

349
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:54,972
All that matters is he...

350
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:58,518
he really seems like he's
trying to do the right thing.

351
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:02,230
- I told you I had a feeling about him.
- [Foggy chuckles]

352
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:05,525
[sighs] It could take us a
week to sift through all this,

353
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:07,235
and we have no idea if
these records are complete.

354
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,839
Even if they are, it doesn't mean that

355
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:11,364
Owlsley's using company
funds to stash Hoffman.

356
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:13,408
Owlsley's a man of financial privilege.

357
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:15,993
I never met one that used his own
money when he could use someone else's.

358
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:17,412
I'll call Marci,

359
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:19,872
see if she found anything else
might help narrow the search.

360
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:21,874
Wait, wait.

361
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,962
All right, this is a rundown of all of
Silver and Brent's real estate holdings.

362
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:29,174
There's 187 just spread
out across New York State.

363
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:30,300
We already looked at that.

364
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:35,513
Well, yeah, but the same rundown dated
for the next day, it lists only 186.

365
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:39,517
Silver and Brent liquidate and
acquire new properties all the time.

366
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:40,810
One of them probably just sold that day.

367
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:44,439
Well, I mean, that's what
I thought, but... look.

368
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:47,900
Look at the balance after the
property disappears from the record.

369
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:50,653
It hasn't changed.

370
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:54,574
So, if it was sold, wouldn't that
be reflected in the profit-loss?

371
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:55,992
Unless someone's trying to hide the fact

372
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,785
the property's been taken
off the records altogether.

373
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:00,705
No shift in profit-loss,
maybe no one notices.

374
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,019
Or it could just be a clerical error.

375
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,584
- Where's the property?
- Uh...

376
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,085
53rd and 10th.

377
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:07,379
Hell's Kitchen.

378
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,591
Right, stay here, keep looking through
the documents in case we're wrong.

379
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,926
I'll go to the 15th and
tell Brett what we found.

380
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,345
Couldn't you just call him?

381
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:19,056
Fisk might be tapping the police
lines for all we know. Keep working.

382
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:22,935
[Foggy] Hey, hey, hey.

383
00:23:24,396 --> 00:23:25,772
You're not going to the 15th, are you?

384
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:29,276
I trust Brett, but he's just one
cop. He couldn't handle it alone.

385
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,568
But you can?

386
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:34,113
I know how you feel about what I do, Foggy.

387
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:37,992
This is the part where law meets reality.

388
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:41,746
Either I put on the mask or we
risk losing Hoffman and Fisk wins.

389
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,501
[door closes]

390
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,512
[cell phone ringing]

391
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:01,974
Yes?

392
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,477
Thank you.

393
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,314
Send the closest team.

394
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,899
No survivors.

395
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,872
[thunder rumbling]

396
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:41,013
[man 1] All right, all right.
We got subs from Marchioni's.

397
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:42,474
[man 2] I thought it was pizza.

398
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:45,101
[man 1] Eh, too hard
to carry with the boxes.

399
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:48,187
There's a, uh, chicken parm...

400
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:49,772
Give it here.

401
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,899
- He call yet?
- No.

402
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:53,735
Still got eight minutes.

403
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:54,986
Owlsley don't call by then,

404
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:56,112
- we can get out of this dump.
- Yeah.

405
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,573
[Hoffman] I don't know,
it kinda grows on you.

406
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:00,199
You got my meatball sub?

407
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:01,534
[man 1] Yeah, uh...

408
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,036
Here you go.

409
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,956
- [gunshots]
- [grunts]

410
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:18,551
[officer 1] All clear.
[officer 2] Check over there.

411
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:20,052
[officer 1] Clear.

412
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,640
Hey, Carl.

413
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:27,644
Been wondering where you got to.

414
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,442
- [gunshots]
- [man grunts]

415
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,743
[man grunting]

416
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,919
[Masked Man panting]

417
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:59,216
[shuddering]

418
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,190
You have an opportunity here, Detective.

419
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:18,320
By turning evidence on Fisk,
you can set things right.

420
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:21,238
If that's what you want.

421
00:26:21,323 --> 00:26:23,533
If not, you can sit here
playing with yourself

422
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,243
until Fisk sends more men to kill you.

423
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:28,079
[Hoffman whimpering]

424
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:31,207
Decide.

425
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:35,252
It won't make a difference.
He owns the cops.

426
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:37,464
- I'll be dead before I can testify...
- Not all of them.

427
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:40,883
Turn yourself in to Brett
Mahoney, you can trust him.

428
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,970
And he knows a couple of lawyers that
can't be bought. They can help you.

429
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:45,054
Yeah.

430
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:47,682
Thanks for the tip.

431
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,313
[panting]

432
00:26:55,357 --> 00:26:57,917
I'll be following you to make
sure you get to the precinct alive.

433
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:01,904
Try to run, try to do anything
other than what I just told you,

434
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:05,032
you'll wish I never saved
you from that bullet.

435
00:27:11,122 --> 00:27:13,207
[indistinct conversations]

436
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:40,359
I need to make a statement.

437
00:27:45,322 --> 00:27:46,574
[Foggy] As we stated on the phone,

438
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:49,035
our client is willing to be
placed in protective custody

439
00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:51,413
and waive all considerations for immunity.

440
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:54,331
- In exchange for what?
- Nothing.

441
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:58,085
Detective Hoffman regrets his involvement
in Wilson Fisk's criminal enterprise

442
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:00,630
and seeks only to unburden himself

443
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:03,090
in the eyes of God and
the state of New York.

444
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:05,134
Detective?

445
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:07,970
[sighs]

446
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:11,348
I've taken money, a lot of
money, to do things for...

447
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,394
For Fisk.

448
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:17,564
I'm not the only one.

449
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:21,609
There's cops, lawyers, judges...

450
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:23,069
[laughs]

451
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:25,237
At least one senator I know of.

452
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:29,951
Start from the beginning.
Names, dates, I want it all.

453
00:28:30,702 --> 00:28:31,828
[Karen chuckles]

454
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:34,997
[Hoffman] My partner and
I were first approached

455
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:38,918
by a man working for Wilson Fisk...

456
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:40,587
18 months ago.

457
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,881
[operatic music playing]

458
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:14,537
[inaudible]

459
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,712
[music crescendos]

460
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:04,814
[reporter1] Senator!
[reporter 2] Senator Cherryh!

461
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,941
[reporter 1] Senator, how
do you respond to allegations

462
00:31:07,024 --> 00:31:08,860
that you accepted payoffs from Wilson Fisk?

463
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:10,444
[Cherryh] I have done
nothing wrong and neither...

464
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:12,446
no further comment.
Other prominent figures...

465
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:15,825
a temporary strike when they
walked out of their jobs...

466
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,660
[Fisk] Make the arrangements.

467
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:21,205
- Wait for my call.
- What they're saying on the news...

468
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:22,790
They're coming for me, Vanessa.

469
00:31:22,874 --> 00:31:24,458
- So we have to leave now.
- It's too late.

470
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:25,793
- There's nothing we can do...
- No!

471
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:28,170
There's nothing that we can do to
keep this from happening. Nothing.

472
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,380
[sighs]

473
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:32,549
I need you to do something for me.

474
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,969
Listen very carefully.

475
00:31:35,052 --> 00:31:37,554
[siren wailing]

476
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:39,766
[indistinct chatter]

477
00:31:46,063 --> 00:31:48,524
Do you understand everything I've told you?

478
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:51,986
- [exhales] Yes.
- There's one more thing.

479
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:53,946
- [banging on door]
- [man] Federal Agents!

480
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,572
We have a warrant for
the arrest of Wilson Fisk.

481
00:31:55,657 --> 00:31:58,534
- I don't have a lot of time.
- [man] Open the door.

482
00:31:58,618 --> 00:32:00,202
[door breaking]

483
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:03,998
Wilson Fisk, you're under
arrest for racketeering.

484
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:06,167
- You have the right to remain silent.
- I want to ask you...

485
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,419
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

486
00:32:08,502 --> 00:32:10,087
- Vanessa...
- You have the right to an attorney.

487
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:11,839
- You are my heart.
- If you cannot afford an attorney...

488
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:13,257
- You're everything.
- One will be provided to you.

489
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,884
Do you understand these rights?

490
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,761
[inaudible]

491
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:34,987
[reporter 1] Mr. Fisk?
[reporter 2] Mr. Fisk?

492
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:36,447
How do you respond to the allegations

493
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,532
that you were involved
with the Ranskahov brothers

494
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:40,242
and that you were
responsible for the bombings?

495
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:43,204
[reporter 1] Senator Cherryh has stated
that he will be exonerated by the facts.

496
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:44,664
Do you feel the same?

497
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:46,427
Mr. Fisk, what about your better tomorrow?

498
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,667
Mr. Fisk?

499
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,044
[reporter 2] Any kind of statement?
Please, any statement whatsoever?

500
00:32:50,127 --> 00:32:52,967
[reporter 3] Mr. Fisk, can you tell
us what you know about the Russians?

501
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,303
The man once hailed as the
savior of Hell's Kitchen

502
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:01,138
is now believed to have been involved...

503
00:33:01,222 --> 00:33:04,851
[Foggy] Now everybody knows what
kind of asshole Fisk really is.

504
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:05,977
[Matt and Karen laughing]

505
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,354
And we are the ones that made
it happen, the three of us.

506
00:33:08,437 --> 00:33:12,024
- And Marci.
- And Marci, God bless her designer pumps.

507
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:13,776
Maybe she's not that bad after all.

508
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,695
Woman does have a way of growing on you.

509
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:18,364
See, this right here...

510
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:19,615
in this office.

511
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:21,492
This is what's important.

512
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:24,871
Knowing that the people
I care about are safe,

513
00:33:24,954 --> 00:33:27,707
and having some sense of
closure for the ones we've lost.

514
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:30,918
For Elena.

515
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,296
For Ben.

516
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,300
And everyone else that
son of a bitch has hurt.

517
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,426
[Foggy chuckles]

518
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,845
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

519
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:43,723
[sirens wailing]

520
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:54,901
I was thinking about
a story from the Bible.

521
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:56,402
Did I tell you to open your mouth?

522
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:58,695
Let him talk. Don't mean nothin'.

523
00:33:59,864 --> 00:34:02,742
I'm not a religious man...

524
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:05,787
but I've read bits and
pieces over the years.

525
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,789
Curiosity more than faith.

526
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:09,999
But this one story...

527
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,626
There was a man.

528
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:17,089
He was traveling from
Jerusalem to Jericho...

529
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:21,302
when he was set upon by men of ill intent.

530
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:26,640
They stripped the traveler
of his clothes, they beat him,

531
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:29,811
and they left him bleeding in the dirt.

532
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:34,857
And a priest happened by...

533
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,111
saw the traveler.

534
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:43,908
But he moved to the other side
of the road and continued on.

535
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:46,911
And then a Levite, a
religious functionary, he...

536
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,373
came to the place, saw the dying traveler.

537
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:59,465
But he too moved to the other
side of the road, passed him by.

538
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:04,053
But then came a man from
Samaria, a Samaritan, a good man.

539
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:07,890
He saw the traveler bleeding in the road

540
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,684
and he stopped to aid him without
thinking of the circumstance

541
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:12,519
or the difficulty it might bring him.

542
00:35:13,354 --> 00:35:15,857
The Samaritan tended to
the traveler's wounds,

543
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,442
applying oil and wine.

544
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:22,071
And he carried him to an inn,

545
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:24,615
gave him all the money he had

546
00:35:24,698 --> 00:35:27,243
for the owner to take care of the traveler,

547
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:29,453
as the Samaritan, he...

548
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,663
continued on his journey.

549
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:37,086
He did this simply because
the traveler was his neighbor.

550
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:40,840
He loved his city and all the people in it.

551
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:45,261
[sighs deeply]

552
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:53,269
I always thought that I was
the Samaritan in that story.

553
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,647
It's funny, isn't it?

554
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,316
How even the best of men can be...

555
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,944
deceived by their true nature.

556
00:36:02,028 --> 00:36:03,188
What the hell does that mean?

557
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:05,781
It means that I'm not the Samaritan.

558
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:10,744
That I'm not the priest, or the Levite.

559
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:14,874
That I am the ill intent...

560
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:21,505
who set upon the traveler on a road
that he should not have been on.

561
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:26,593
[brakes screeching]

562
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:28,054
[tires screeching]

563
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:41,150
- Go, go!
- Oh, shit!

564
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,069
[officer] Take cover! Take cover!

565
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:45,905
[guns cocking]

566
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:04,924
[muffled gunfire]

567
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:07,384
Tac One! Tac One!
Requesting sitrep! How copy?

568
00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:14,350
We're taking fire! We're
taking fire! Requesting backup.

569
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:21,857
What appears now to be
some sort of firefight

570
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:24,944
involving the FBI transport
carrying Wilson Fisk.

571
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:27,029
Uh, Janet, can you confirm
what we're seeing here?

572
00:37:29,656 --> 00:37:33,202
Jesus, we were idiots, weren't
we? Sitting here, celebrating,

573
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,746
thinking that it would be
that easy with a man like him.

574
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:38,590
Let's get out of here before they
close down the streets or something.

575
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:40,792
[Matt] Get her home. [Foggy] Okay.

576
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,461
No, no, where are you
going? We're not leaving you.

577
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:44,505
Back to my place, make some
calls, see what I can find out.

578
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:46,048
- We'll drop you.
- You live on the other side of town.

579
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:47,174
I'll be all right.

580
00:37:47,258 --> 00:37:48,717
Hang on, I'll get him a cab.

581
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,095
- Wait, Foggy...
- [Matt] Taxi!

582
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:52,679
[Foggy] You heard what's
going on out there.

583
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:54,265
You can't go up against
that in your black pajamas.

584
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:55,391
- I won't be.
- Matt...

585
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:56,767
I know I haven't earned it, not yet anyway,

586
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,853
but I'm asking you to trust me,
Foggy. I know what I'm doing.

587
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:03,440
All right.

588
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:08,237
Go be a hero. Just don't
get killed doing it, okay?

589
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:10,614
Where you headed?

590
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:16,203
[indistinct radio chatter]

591
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,710
[officers grunting]

592
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:26,338
[man] Perimeter secure. Retrieving package.

593
00:38:29,466 --> 00:38:32,011
I don't know who you assholes think
you are, but if you don't back away,

594
00:38:32,094 --> 00:38:34,638
I swear to God, I'll put a
bullet in this fat son of a bitch!

595
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,185
Let's get you out of here, sir.

596
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:46,775
Package acquired.

597
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,619
[man] Move! Move!

598
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:00,789
Go!

599
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:30,277
If anyone tries to follow,
on the ground or in the air,

600
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:31,862
take them out.

601
00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:34,781
[distant sirens wailing]

602
00:39:41,955 --> 00:39:44,916
Haven't had enough time to get
all of it through the process.

603
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,461
[sighs]

604
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:49,755
Black parts will give the most protection.

605
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:55,594
Red might deflect a knife,
depending on the angle...

606
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,264
might not.

607
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,320
It'll do just fine.

608
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:16,198
Thank you, Melvin.

609
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:19,535
Betsy?

610
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:23,205
She gonna be safe now from Mr. Fisk?

611
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:25,499
I made you a promise.

612
00:40:25,582 --> 00:40:26,958
I intend to keep it.

613
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,013
[sirens wailing]

614
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:43,225
[officer on radio] All units, be advised,

615
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:45,561
do not approach subject if sighted.

616
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:49,105
Notify ESU forthwith.
Repeat, do not approach.

617
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:23,349
[engine starts]

618
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,032
Package is en route. I say again...

619
00:41:41,116 --> 00:41:42,451
[over radio] the package is en route.

620
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:44,828
ETA 18 minutes. Prepare for extraction.

621
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:46,330
Copy that.

622
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:48,164
- Sir?
- Thank you.

623
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,712
I know this has been a
difficult chapter in our lives.

624
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:55,964
[Vanessa] We'll be together,
that's all that matters.

625
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,885
Now, if I'm not there by
your side in 20 minutes...

626
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:01,470
I want you to leave.

627
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:04,055
I'm not gonna let them take
you away from me, Wilson.

628
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,016
If I'm not there by that time...

629
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,811
there isn't anything you can
do to stop that from happening.

630
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:13,189
But it won't be the end,
Vanessa. [stammering] It's...

631
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:17,986
it's just an inconvenience.

632
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:21,031
Nothing will ever keep us apart.

633
00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:22,949
[sighs]

634
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:37,881
Fifteen minutes to the drop.
Repeat, 15 minutes to the drop...

[groans]

638
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:11,206
You were right...

639
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,084
what you told me over the radio that night.

640
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:17,879
Not everyone deserves a happy ending.

641
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:24,845
You?

[grunting]

644
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:13,644
I wanted to make this city...

645
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:16,647
something better than it is.

646
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,483
Something beautiful.

647
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:21,652
You took that away from me!

648
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:24,946
You took everything!

649
00:44:26,407 --> 00:44:28,367
I'm gonna kill you!

650
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:34,748
Take your shot.

This city doesn't
deserve a better tomorrow.

659
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,472
It deserves to drown...

660
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:16,307
in its filth!

661
00:46:16,391 --> 00:46:20,228
It deserves people like
my father! People like you!

00:46:59,935 --> 00:47:02,145
You really think that this will...

667
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:05,857
change anything?

668
00:47:09,611 --> 00:47:12,030
You think one man in...

669
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:14,741
a silly little costume...

670
00:47:14,825 --> 00:47:16,409
will...

671
00:47:16,492 --> 00:47:18,119
will make a difference?

672
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:24,250

Do it!

- Show me your hands!
- [panting]

679
00:47:54,364 --> 00:47:55,991
I told you before, Sergeant...

680
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,619
I'm not the bad guy.

681
00:47:59,828 --> 00:48:02,831
Holy shit, it's you.

682
00:48:03,373 --> 00:48:06,918
This man was a fugitive from
the law, and I stopped him.

We good?

00:48:13,008 --> 00:48:14,550

00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:16,678
Be advised,

Wilson Fisk under K, north
alley four-six and ten.

Thank you, Sergeant.

690
00:49:44,307 --> 00:49:47,393
Hey, so what am I supposed to
call you when I file my report?

691
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:53,358
[Karen] Daredevil.

692
00:49:54,735 --> 00:49:55,944
That's what they're calling him now.

693
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:57,695
The man in the mask.

694
00:49:57,779 --> 00:49:59,405
Daredevil?

695
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:02,826
Sounds like he's gonna jump Snake
River Canyon on his rocket cycle.

696
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:05,245
[laughing] It kinda does, doesn't it?

697
00:50:05,328 --> 00:50:06,371
Okay, okay.

698
00:50:06,454 --> 00:50:09,082
I thought it was a bit goofy at
first, but it kinda grows on you.

699
00:50:09,165 --> 00:50:11,584
And it's better than the
Devil of Hell's Kitchen anyway.

700
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:13,461
Not wrong there.

701
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:15,421
[Karen] I cannot believe
this is the same guy

702
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:19,217
that stopped that Union Allied nut
from stabbing me in my apartment.

703
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:21,928
That is a serious upgrade.

704
00:50:22,012 --> 00:50:24,180
I don't know, I think
the horns are a bit much.

705
00:50:25,098 --> 00:50:26,933
There! Done!

706
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,144
What do you think?

707
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:30,728
I think I'm glad I fished
it out of the trash.

708
00:50:30,812 --> 00:50:32,063
Me too.

709
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,151
Nelson and Murdock.

710
00:50:37,903 --> 00:50:40,196
- Avocados at law.
- [chuckling]

711
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,531
"Avocados"?

712
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:43,616
It's a long story.

713
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:47,162
Which I do not have time to tell you.

714
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:49,205
Promised Marci I'd help her find a new job

715
00:50:49,289 --> 00:50:51,624
since most of the partners at
Landman and Zack are under indictment.

716
00:50:51,707 --> 00:50:53,501
Oh? You two getting back together?

717
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:55,211
No. I don't know.

718
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:56,337
Maybe.

719
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:57,547
[both laugh]

720
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,134
Well, thank her for us.

721
00:51:01,217 --> 00:51:03,303
For everything she did
helping bring Fisk down.

722
00:51:03,845 --> 00:51:05,305
Fisk still needs to go to trial.

723
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:07,891
Just getting a court date on a
case this big could take a year.

724
00:51:07,974 --> 00:51:09,976
- That long?
- He's where he belongs,

725
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,394
that's all that matters.

726
00:51:11,477 --> 00:51:13,146
And we put him there.

727
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:15,523
Yeah, we did.

728
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:16,774
Hell of a sign.

729
00:51:17,525 --> 00:51:19,277
Now all we need are clients.

730
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,155
One day at a time,
partner. One day at a time.

731
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:27,368
Guess that means we
should get back to work.

732
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:31,789
- Hey, Karen.
- Yeah.

733
00:51:35,043 --> 00:51:37,753
There's been something in your voice.

734
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:42,758
[stammers] It's been there for a while now.

735
00:51:42,843 --> 00:51:45,511
I thought whatever it
was, whatever's been...

736
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:50,058
I thought it would get better
once Fisk was put away, but...

737
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:54,395
it hasn't, has it?

738
00:51:58,399 --> 00:51:59,901
[sighs]

739
00:51:59,985 --> 00:52:01,819
We put him away, yeah...

740
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,241
but it won't bring back Elena...

741
00:52:07,783 --> 00:52:08,994
or Ben...

742
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:13,789
or erase what we've been through, or...

743
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,710
what we've had to do to get here.

744
00:52:17,793 --> 00:52:19,337
Yeah.

745
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:24,467
A lot of decisions I'd give
anything to go back and change.

746
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,219
[breathes deeply]

747
00:52:26,302 --> 00:52:27,762
But I can't.

748
00:52:29,014 --> 00:52:30,556
None of us can.

749
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:35,728
It's like I told Foggy, all
we can do is move forward...

750
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:39,732
together.

751
00:53:00,253 --> 00:53:02,088
Come on.

752
00:53:12,598 --> 00:53:14,892
[inmates speaking indistinctly]

753
00:53:27,322 --> 00:53:29,324
[sighs]

754
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,145
[woman screaming]

755
00:54:13,994 --> 00:54:15,996
[dramatic music playing]
