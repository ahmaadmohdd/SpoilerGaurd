Yeah!

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,862
- Come on.

- Go for it!

22
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,697
Professor Reed called
my thesis "bromidic."

23
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,284
I had to look it up. Do you
know what "bromidic" means?

24
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,954
- Yeah, it means, like, dull, right?
- Right.

25
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,550
What's your major again? English?

26
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,595
Oh, no, I'm taking kind of a gap year.

27
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,936
- Later.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,278
Yo, let me get a gram.

29
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,406
Uh... Yeah, that'll be $100.

30
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,450
How about a student discount?

31
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,243
Yeah, that's cute.

32
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,996
Come on, help me out. I
can give you, like, $60.

33
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,123
That's beer money. I don't sell beer.

34
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,208
Okay.

35
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,710
Hey!

36
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,507
Hey!

37
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,893
Attachment is the root of suffering.

38
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,895
- Give it back.
- Here!

39
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,400
Apologize.

40
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,610
Suck my dick.

41
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,200
- I'm sorry!
- Yeah, I didn't quite catch that.

42
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,955
- God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Now he's sorry.

43
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,457
Come on. Come on.

44
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,378
- You okay?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,093
Namaste.

46
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,685
What?

47
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,438
"Namaste."

48
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,691
Shut up. How'd we do?

49
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,236
Thank God for midterms.

50
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,532
Shit.

51
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,701
Shit.

52
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,745
Hey.

53
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,583
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I just... I overslept.

54
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,377
No, no, no, no, I stayed at Rhiannon's.

55
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,380
Okay, okay, relax. Relax, I'll
be there in a minute. Okay?

56
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,466
I gotta go.

57
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,927
Shit, shit.

58
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,889
Okay.

59
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,552
Okay.

60
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,951
Shit.

61
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,197
Karen?

62
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,577
Comin'.

63
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,707
Sorry, sorry. I'm here.

64
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,918
Hey. You were at Lynch's
picking up pastries.

65
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,541
- Thank you.
- Where the hell have you been?

66
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,133
Sorry, I was at the
bakery getting pastries,

67
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,509
but they're not ready yet.

68
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,354
- Alice says hi, by the way.
- Your brother coulda done that.

69
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,639
I need you here to prep
the front. You know that.

70
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,242
- Yeah, sorry.
- Yeah, it's my bad, Pop.

71
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,976
I had to work the
grill, I asked her to go.

72
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,145
I'm not set up for the
day. I'm drownin' here.

73
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,751
Dad, I did most of my prep last night.

74
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:25,207
I have to make coffee and set tables.

75
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,351
- But it's all under control, okay?
- Get to it, then.

76
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,152
I got it.

77
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,872
6:01, Karen.

78
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,251
Nice to see you, too.

79
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,961
How's that?

80
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,340
I said your coffee's on me today.

81
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,052
Eggs and sausage?

82
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,970
If it's not too much trouble for ya.

83
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,063
Houston, we have liftoff!

84
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,024
- Sausage and eggs?
- Uh, he wants a BLT today.

85
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,109
Really?

86
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,778
Oh. Ha!

87
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,738
Hey, have I told you
lately that you suck?

88
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,240
Yeah, probably.

89
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,743
- Where's Dad?
- Delivery's here.

90
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,579
No, no, no. Sysco
already came this week.

91
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,165
Uh...

92
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,088
Gorgeous.

93
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,340
- Thanks, Jake.
- Yeah.

94
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,018
- You're gonna love it.
- Dad?

95
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:35,176
Ah!

96
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,514
- Hey, what's going on?
- Well, it was time, honey.

97
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,767
How could you do this
without talkin' to me?

98
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,895
Well, I got news for you, kid,
I don't need your permission.

99
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,526
This grill costs $5,000. How
are we gonna pay for that?

100
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,696
Pat Condo says they're gonna
reopen the ski runs real soon.

101
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,241
- We're gonna be swarming with customers.
- Pat's been saying that for ten years.

102
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,453
No, look, Jake... Jake, we
gotta send it back. I'm sorry.

103
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,624
No, we're not. You said you had
somethin' you want me to sign, yes?

104
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,959
Yeah, it's in the truck.

105
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,131
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

106
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,467
You'll figure something
out, honey. You always do.

107
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,912
Everything okay?

108
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,664
Yeah.

109
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,374
I had to fetch my own coffee.

110
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,110
Well, when you go back for a refill,

111
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:52,003
I take mine with milk and two sugars.

112
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,089
Karen, honey, you're starting
to remind me of my wife.

113
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,258
I don't like it.

114
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,219
Need anything else?

115
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,889
New eggs would be nice.

116
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,145
Oh, God. Shit.

117
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,106
I'm so sorry. Just...

118
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,068
Are you okay, toots?

119
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,239
Uh, yeah. No, it's just been
dry lately. I'll get you...

120
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,036
Fresh eggs.

121
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,457
- Is something wrong with 'em?
- No, no. I just dropped 'em. Stupid.

122
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,879
You know, studies show hand-eye
coordination improves 110%

123
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,089
when you're sober.

124
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,802
Maybe use less butter, and
they won't slide off the plate.

125
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,521
Thanks.

126
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,315
Hey...

127
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,650
do we have a regular
order set up with Sysco,

128
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,534
or do we have to, like,
call it in every time?

129
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,930
Why? You looking for a career
in the greasy spoon industry?

130
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,448
Figured I could pull more weight,

131
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,699
- that's all.
- Why?

132
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,958
Why would you suddenly
feel the need for that?

133
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,233
I'm trying to steal your
position of power in the family.

134
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,207
You have somethin' to
say, say it, I got a lot...

135
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,958
- Can you stop being a dick for two...
- Okay, you caught me.

136
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,627
Fine. I do drugs, all
right? I'm a big junkie.

137
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,881
I'm just two lines away from giving
blow jobs for heroin on the street.

138
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,764
Thanks for the intervention.
I won't touch it.

139
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,360
- We done?
- That's not what I'm talking...

140
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,944
If I wanna go blow off steam,
it's none of your goddamn business.

141
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,515
- What? What...
- Read it.

142
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,566
No, I deferred.

143
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,151
Yeah, I undeferred you.

144
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,619
I believe the traditional
response is, "Thank you."

145
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,289
No, how... How could you do this?

146
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,334
Because you gotta get outta here, Karen.

147
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,966
Oh, I could kill him.

148
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,972
Well, you can't go to college.

149
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,600
You'd miss me too much.

150
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,063
I don't know, I could just
get myself a college boyfriend.

151
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,190
Name's Ian.

152
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,776
He plays lacrosse, by the way.

153
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,612
Sounds like a douche.

154
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,156
He is. But he's hung like a horse.

155
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,993
But seriously...

156
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,829
you gonna go?

157
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,047
We both know I'm not goin' anywhere.

158
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,220
Nothing's permanent, Karen.

159
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,223
Not even the Buddha.

160
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,433
Mmm.

161
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,436
Fagan Corners is.

162
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,564
Sometimes, I feel like I
could burn that diner down,

163
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,774
and it would just respawn by morning.

164
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,276
Not if you use diesel.

165
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,530
That's good to know.

166
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,032
Well...

167
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,452
It'll come in useful

168
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,539
when I can't find the five
grand to pay for that grill.

169
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,709
Your dad needs to stop
with that bullshit.

170
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,712
It shouldn't be on you to take
care of him and your brother.

171
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,306
Maybe you should just
let the diner go under.

172
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,716
Yeah, we should.

173
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,554
But it's all he's got left of my mom.

174
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,849
You're trapping yourself
with that guilt shit.

175
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,435
You're way too nice, K.

176
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,104
Yeah, I know.

177
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,357
You know...

178
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,985
if you wanna make some real money,

179
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,154
you could always come
work with me full-time.

180
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,364
- Pay off that grill in a week.
- No.

181
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,408
Seriously. You're good at it.

182
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,828
You and me together, we could
take this thing to the next level.

183
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,248
You could hook up your family
and do shit for yourself.

184
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,751
Every now and then, we
could even go places.

185
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,629
Tibet. Paris.

186
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,964
Anywhere we want.

187
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,300
Sounds good, right?

188
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,512
Yeah.

189
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,649
Mmm!

190
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,491
Like a dream.

191
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,255
Hey, Dad.

192
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,557
Hey.

193
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,726
- Hey.
- What's goin' on?

194
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,520
Dad said I had to come back right away.

195
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,524
I just wanted you here
for dinner, little girl.

196
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,194
You made, uh...

197
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,780
Karencakes. That's
right. We're celebrating.

198
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,801
Come on. Sit down, honey. We're
gonna have dinner like a family.

199
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,536
We won't be able to once you
go off to college, now will we?

200
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,666
- Hey. What the hell did you tell him?
- The truth.

201
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,919
That you can only defer Georgetown
twice, or you'd have to reapply.

202
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,755
- So you're goin' next term.
- God damn it, Kevin. No.

203
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:17,722
Don't worry about us,
Karen. You should go.

204
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,557
Dad, I'm not goin' anywhere.

205
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,936
Listen, Kevin and I will get by.

206
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,107
Besides that, you know, it's
obvious you're bored here.

207
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,359
It's affecting your work.

208
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,865
Sorry, you have a problem with my work?

209
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,704
Well, you're late all the time.

210
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,627
You go out most nights, running
around with that Todd Neiman loser.

211
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,381
Do you think it's some big secret?

212
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,008
That's none of your business.

213
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,054
And you think people
don't know what he does?

214
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,224
Do you think that I
don't know what he does?

215
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,934
- Dad...
- He's the only person

216
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,519
who gives a shit about how I feel.

217
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,230
- He's a loser.
- Dad, she gets it.

218
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,692
And what you do reflects
back on this family.

219
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,986
You think that I don't
want to go to college?

220
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,322
I can't go to college.

221
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,949
If I leave here, this place
will go under in a week.

222
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,493
We'll be fine.

223
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,828
You just bought a grill
that will bankrupt us.

224
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,268
You know what? I'm...

225
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:27,333
I'm sorry, but Mom used to
do everything around here,

226
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,019
- and now I have to...
- Okay, guys, stop.

227
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,253
No! You have no clue
how to run this place.

228
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,297
- I run the front. I do the books.
- Karen, stop.

229
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,092
- This is ridiculous.
- No, Dad, Dad. You are lost in a fog.

230
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,637
The diner has been failing for
years, and you won't admit it.

231
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,721
You keep clinging to it,

232
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,965
'cause you think Mom's gonna
find her way back somehow.

233
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,934
Well, if she does,
you're not gonna be here,

234
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,579
- so it won't be your problem...
- Yeah, well, Mom hated this place.

235
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,123
She hated this town, you never saw it.

236
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,107
She loved this place. This was her home.

237
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,360
No, she loved you. That is the
only reason she stuck around.

238
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,530
She felt like she was dying here
a long time before she got cancer.

239
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,577
You take that back.

240
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,835
You ever wonder why Mom
kept buying lottery tickets?

241
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,212
For somethin' to hope on
when she went into remission.

242
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,455
You know what she was hoping?

243
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,545
She was hoping that if she
ever got a second chance,

244
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,134
she would get us the hell out of here.

245
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,011
Well, Mom never got to
find out, so let's see, huh?

246
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,430
Put that down!

247
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,021
What do you think? One scratch,
and we pay off all the bills.

248
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:35,234
One scratch, and we go our own
way. One last gift from Mom.

249
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,238
Don't.

250
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,031
Karen, please don't.

251
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,844
Mom lost again.

252
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,474
We all lose.

253
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,226
Now we know.

254
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,844
Hey. Shh... Hey.

255
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,554
Hey.

256
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,057
- Let's get you out of here.
- Yeah.

257
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,225
Okay?

258
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,684
Where are you going?

259
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,686
- You can't just leave!
- Kevin...

260
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,850
Shoulda asked her before
you sent that letter.

261
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,441
- I'm not talking to you, asshole.
- Come on, let's just go.

262
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,776
You're lucky your sister's hot.

263
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,363
Hey, does Bernie know you sell, Todd?

264
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,573
- Maybe he should.
- What the hell did you just say?

265
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,867
- You heard me!
- Hey, hey! Hey, hey! No, no, no.

266
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,912
Hey, hey, hey. I'd go to jail,
too. Is that what you want, Kevin?

267
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,540
Just go inside. Come on, just go inside.

268
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,292
Come on, let's go.
Please, let's go. Let's go.

269
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,086
Just go inside, Kevin. Go.

270
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,150
Babe, take it easy.

271
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,807
- What the hell?
- Shit. Kevin?

272
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,311
You stay the hell away from my sister!

273
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,114
- You're dead, asshole!
- No!

274
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,449
Shit.

275
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,036
Todd, no!

276
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,287
No! Hey!

277
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,762
You get away from him, Todd!

278
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,983
Come on, come on, come on! Get up!

279
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,988
Are you crazy?

280
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,116
Okay. Okay.

281
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,181
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
What's the matter with you?

282
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,728
I was gonna fix it! I was
gonna fix it! You ruined it!

283
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,064
Why? Why would you do that?

284
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,692
Huh?

285
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,029
Because... I already lost Mom.

286
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,116
Watch out!

287
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:02,978
Kev?

288
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,314
Kevin!

289
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,007
Dad.

290
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,443
You weren't there.

291
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,907
What?

292
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,329
Bernie is gonna say it
was just Kevin in the car.

293
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,417
But...

294
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,377
He's gonna omit...

295
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,548
certain other details.

296
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,555
He said we've suffered enough.

297
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,854
Dad, I...

298
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,689
You'd go to prison.

299
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,239
Thank God your mother
wasn't alive for this.

300
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,629
Reverend Shockne called...

301
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,967
about Kevin's arrangements.

302
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,178
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

303
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,722
No.

304
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,853
I need you to, uh...

305
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,488
leave.

306
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,411
I don't want you here, Karen.

307
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,209
Uh...

308
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,295
Hi.

309
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,130
You doing okay down here?

310
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,216
Yeah.

311
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,427
Thanks.

312
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,723
Will it offend you if I
say I'll be glad to be gone?

313
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,770
Sister Maggie called.

314
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,981
She said she'd have some options
for you by the end of the day.

315
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,359
You'll be safe soon.

316
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,152
If you say.

317
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,630
Well, I'm getting ready to say Mass.

318
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,242
Um, you could come up if you'd like.

319
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,037
Uh, no, no. Thank you. I'm not Catholic.

320
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,538
Hell, if you get strict about it,

321
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,499
neither are most of the
people who come here.

322
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,752
That doesn't mean you shouldn't join us.

323
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,215
A little ritual, a
little ancient wisdom.

324
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,093
Not the worst medicine
for a troubled soul.

325
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,682
Jesus. Am I that transparent?

326
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:39,606
Someone once said that everyone is
fighting a battle of their own...

327
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,900
that you can't see.

328
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,028
But sometimes...

329
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,158
Sometimes...

330
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,204
you can see.

331
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,290
Yeah.

332
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,465
Father, what do you do...

333
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,180
when you realize that you've lost?

334
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:27,946
A man I helped raise as a
boy came to see me recently.

335
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,157
Matt.

336
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,118
I had...

337
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,829
I had a choice of evils.

338
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:43,253
He blames me for the ones I chose,
for the way his life turned out.

339
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,841
I can't argue with him.

340
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,136
I just have to find
a way to live with it.

341
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,977
Yeah, but how do you live with that?

342
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:05,484
Knowing that you... that
you hurt someone like that?

343
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,787
Well, you have to realize, Karen,

344
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:10,155
that whatever it is that you've done...

345
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,449
or haven't done...

346
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,577
it can still be redeemed.

347
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,461
Yeah, that's nice, but I'm not
so sure that I believe that.

348
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,775
"Everything will be okay in the end.

349
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:33,470
If it's not okay, it's not the end."

350
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,642
John Lennon said that. Who
are we to argue with a Beatle?

351
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,564
Do yourself a kindness. Come to Mass.

352
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,449
Karen Page is located
at the Clinton Church.

353
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,732
Keep all NYPD units
clear of that location

354
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:00,413
until otherwise advised. Copy.

355
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,958
There's one more thing
we need to do tonight.

356
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,717
I don't let people know me.

357
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,053
Very few have.

358
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:21,434
There was one person, an employee
that I let become my friend.

359
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,479
Eventually, he was like a son to me.

360
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,939
James Wesley.

361
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,400
- Yeah.
- I've read his file.

362
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,530
You're like him in many ways.

363
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,074
He, too, was always prepared.

364
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,618
Aware of every detail.

365
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,956
He anticipated my every need.

366
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,500
He disappeared.

367
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,210
He was murdered!

368
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:01,016
When I sent you to the Bulletin,
it was to discredit Daredevil

369
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,643
and the reporter who
helped him become a hero.

370
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,606
I didn't know at the time,
but Karen Page killed Wesley.

371
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:17,532
Mr. Fisk, if there's
something you want me to do...

372
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,200
just ask.

373
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,328
I want you to kill Karen Page.

374
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,627
Consider it done.

375
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,182
What does Fisk want with Karen?

376
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,726
He wants her killed.

377
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,983
Well, good evening, everyone.

378
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,487
I just want to take a moment
before the service starts

379
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,574
to thank you all for coming out tonight.

380
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:04,329
The events of recent days
have been deeply troubling.

381
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,749
Especially for us,
here in Hell's Kitchen.

382
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,507
He's downstairs. There are
no cameras in the bedroom.

383
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,925
No, no. God...

384
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,639
How long?

385
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,722
What? What are...

386
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,284
- How long until he gets here?
- Seconds.

387
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,896
If you leave, I have to
tell him you were here.

388
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,774
- He'll triple security.
- No, no...

389
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,026
Getting back in here will be impossible.

390
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,321
You'll never have
another chance like this.

391
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,910
- Where are we going, Dex?
- Just keep going straight.

392
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,332
Institutions we trust
have been attacked.

393
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,627
Innocent people have been killed.

394
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,674
Wait for me over there. Keep the
car running. I'll be back soon.

395
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,759
What are you gonna do?

396
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,639
Don't worry, partner. I'll do us proud.

397
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,102
We have been called upon to question

398
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,689
whether the people we thought
were fighting for us...

399
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,818
were really monsters all along.

400
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:21,448
We are being told that
we are not strong...

401
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,491
that we are not safe.

402
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,452
You do what you have to do.

403
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,915
Yet... here we are.

404
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:36,838
Stronger, because we will
not accept that we are weak.

405
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,050
Safer, because we will not be divided.

406
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,430
I am proud of all of you for
coming here despite your fears.

407
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:50,518
And I am grateful to you, always...

408
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,689
for letting me call myself one of you.

409
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,236
Even when the night is darkest...

410
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,071
Karen Page!

411
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,628
Where is...

412
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,173
Karen Page?

413
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,936
It's locked!

414
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,438
- Go back! Turn around!
- Go back.

415
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,733
All right, hurry up! Hurry!

416
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,403
I'm here!

417
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,406
I'm here. Please...

418
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,911
No, no, no, no, no.
Please, don't. Please.

419
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,788
Please, no, no.

420
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,922
Hello, Karen. It's
nice to see you again.

421
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,964
No!

422
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,016
No, no...

423
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,399
Matthew...

424
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:06,821
Matthew, please forgive us.

425
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:09,032
No.

426
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,342
Matt. Matt, I can get everyone out.

427
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,344
But you have to get
them away from the nave.

428
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,425
Okay. Okay. Can you get them out?

429
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,682
Okay, it's over there. Just wait...

430
00:41:11,683 --> 00:41:14,180
Wait till I distract him, okay? Okay.

431
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,380
Hey!

432
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,966
I'm the one you want, right?

433
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,059
Karen?

434
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,689
Karen?

435
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,534
Oh, my God. Matt. Matt. Matt.

436
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,619
Matt, you okay? You okay?

437
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,454
Hey.

438
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,165
I can't... can't let him leave.

439
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,042
No, no, no.

440
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,422
Oh, shit, no, he's gone.

441
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:57,760
It's okay. It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

442
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,596
Matt? Matt?

443
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,644
Matt?

444
