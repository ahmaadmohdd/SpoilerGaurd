2
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,877
There is no corpse.

3
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,594
There's no corpse.

4
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,470
I heard you.

5
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,605
Remind Felix Manning that I
do not tolerate loose ends.

6
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,897
Yes, Mr. Fisk.

7
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,860
But the body was probably
just swept away in the current.

8
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,405
Even if Murdock somehow
escaped from the cab,

9
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,158
how does a blind man swim to shore?

10
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,121
This look like a blind man to you?

11
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,717
We investigated him thoroughly.

12
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,052
His associates.

13
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,889
Medical and school
records all check out.

14
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,309
All confirm that Matt Murdock
lost his sight at age nine.

15
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,269
Yes.

16
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,855
Nevertheless...

17
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,276
a man capable of that
could have survived.

18
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,829
And he threatened to come
between Vanessa and I.

19
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,347
It's time for the
government to honor our deal.

20
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,557
Thanks to my client,

21
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,769
the Albanian Syndicate has
been completely wiped out.

22
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,816
Their counterfeiting ring,
their Dark Web child pornography.

23
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,945
And the Jalisco connection
Mr. Fisk divulged last week

24
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,074
gave the DEA an early
and very white Christmas.

25
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,119
And in exchange for
his ongoing cooperation,

26
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,789
the DOJ will not be filing
charges against Vanessa Marianna.

27
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,335
Mr. Fisk is also entitled to the
return of certain personal belongings,

28
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,170
supervised movement within the hotel.

29
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,298
He'll get everything
he was offered. In time.

30
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,843
That time is now, Special Agent Nadeem.

31
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,555
Unless you'd like my
client to stop talking.

32
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,977
FBI has sacrificed a great deal for me.

33
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:56,403
And I will continue to cooperate
and trust you'll honor your word.

34
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,912
There's a criminal I've employed.

35
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,750
A facilitator.

36
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,920
On my behalf, he's
laundered and hid money,

37
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,674
bribed law enforcement
and court officials,

38
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:22,929
orchestrated perjured
testimony, manufactured evidence.

39
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,557
Who is he?

40
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,813
A lawyer. Matthew Murdock.

41
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,483
Alpha Team on approach.

42
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,947
FBI. Get back in your
apartment and close the door.

43
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,579
Stack up.

44
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,288
Breach.

45
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,835
FBI!

46
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,172
Clear!

47
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,270
Murdock's been home.

48
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,648
Recently.

49
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,902
It was so nice to see you again.

50
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,237
Take care.

51
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,963
Felix Manning?

52
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,881
You haven't returned my calls.

53
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,341
Karen Page, from the Bulletin.

54
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Before I go to print,

55
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,101
I'm obligated to offer
you a chance to comment

56
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,223
on your involvement in
laundering money for Wilson Fisk.

57
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,857
Look, if you talk to me off the
record, help me connect some dots,

58
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,776
I promise I will keep
your name out of it.

59
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,656
But that is only if you talk to me.

60
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,369
You're a fixer, Mr. Manning.

61
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,165
You're a freelancer. Other
clients, a lot to lose.

62
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,961
Once this story breaks, Fisk
is gonna hang you out to dry.

63
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,007
If I were you, I would
start looking out for myself.

64
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,759
Karen Page.

65
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,845
Daughter of Paxton and Penelope.

66
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:37,142
239 Kings Road, Fagan Corners, Vermont.

67
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:42,981
You had the back room. My guess, Dad
wanted his little girl to be safe.

68
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,193
Sadly, he should've been more
worried about his little boy.

69
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,740
Drug addicts really do
destroy families, don't they?

70
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,784
Off the record,

71
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,953
you're incorrect.

72
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,748
About what I do for a living.

73
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,250
I don't fix problems.

74
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,173
I make them disappear.

75
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,581
Karen Page?

76
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,209
- Who are you?
- Don't move.

77
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:52,842
Uh... I have a weapon in my purse.
And a concealed carry permit.

78
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,679
Keep your hands exactly where they
are and follow my instructions.

79
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,932
Now turn around.

80
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,392
Okay. Okay.

81
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,690
Okay. Okay.

82
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,989
What do you want from me?

83
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,249
What happened?

84
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,876
Why'd you bring me here?

85
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,879
I asked him to.

86
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,548
Is Matt okay?

87
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,634
You wanna tell me what's going on?

88
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,929
Ms. Page, I get that you
ask questions for a living,

89
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,640
but, for now, I'll be the one asking.

90
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,699
When's the last time you
heard from Matt Murdock?

91
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,208
Um...

92
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,589
- Months.
- You haven't seen or spoken to him in months?

93
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,299
Uh, no.

94
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,220
He give you any indication
when he'd be back?

95
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,016
Uh, no.

96
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,476
Or whether he'd be back at all?

97
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,021
No.

98
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,110
Then why have you been paying his bills?

99
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,033
He's a friend. Someone had
to do it while he was away.

100
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:45,622
So your friend, a blind man who
you haven't spoken to in months,

101
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,918
just ups and disappears, and you
don't file a missing persons report?

102
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,170
I figured he'd come
back when he was ready.

103
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,263
Can you think of any reason why
Matt Murdock would go on the run?

104
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,225
No.

105
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,271
You were a secretary
for Nelson and Murdock.

106
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,148
Mmm-mmm. Office manager.

107
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,860
And when did the firm first
start working for Wilson Fisk?

108
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,153
Um...

109
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,280
We never worked for Wilson Fisk.

110
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,580
Is that your signature?

111
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,816
Do you remember depositing

112
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:32,043
this retainer check for
a company called CGI?

113
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,809
Yes, I do. Um...

114
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,131
Look, Matt and Foggy took on
one case for them. That's all.

115
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,634
According to my source,
CGI was a front for Fisk.

116
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,636
Well, we didn't know that at the time.

117
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,222
But you do now.

118
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,394
So you see how your last answer
wasn't technically accurate?

119
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,146
Okay, we never knowingly
worked for Fisk.

120
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,315
They hired us through someone else.

121
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,399
Who?

122
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,277
Some executive.

123
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,696
Hang on.

124
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,339
Was it this guy?

125
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,883
James Wesley. You remember him?

126
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,388
Uh, yeah. I think that was him. Why?

127
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,978
Just trying to put the pieces together.

128
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,027
Okay. Uh... Well, here are some
other pieces for you to put together.

129
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,777
Um...

130
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,711
Felix Manning. Red Lion
National Bank. Vancorp.

131
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:45,775
Any of that ring any bells?

132
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,577
I don't follow.

133
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,705
Well, instead of letting
Fisk use you and the FBI

134
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,142
to retaliate against innocent
lawyers who put him in prison,

135
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,169
why don't you ask him if he
hired a fixer named Felix Manning

136
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,379
to launder money through Red Lion?

137
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:02,383
Ask him if he's the true owner
of a shell company called Vancorp.

138
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,302
Why would I do that?

139
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,721
Because it just bought
the Presidential Hotel.

140
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,725
Where are you getting this from?

141
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,688
I ask questions for a living. I
just ask better ones than you do.

142
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,980
Like, has your so-called prisoner

143
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:21,361
just bought the prison
you're keeping him in?

144
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,739
Has he bought?

145
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,035
So this is what? Just a theory?

146
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,286
You have any proof?

147
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,289
Fisk is using you, Agent
Nadeem. That's what he does.

148
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,999
Is that a no?

149
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,335
Am I under arrest?

150
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,296
Not at this time.

151
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,757
Then I'm done answering
the wrong questions.

152
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,780
Is this everything?

153
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,492
Everything Felix's investigators
were able to dig up on short notice.

154
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,334
Uh...

155
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,052
This will take some time.

156
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,471
I brought an audiobook.

157
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,692
Dex, ready to go?

158
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,029
Game starts in 20. Traffic's
a nightmare. We gotta hustle.

159
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,617
What's the deal? You don't
even got your uniform on.

160
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,913
You all right, buddy?

161
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,084
Trouble in paradise?

162
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,882
Does the headmaster know you're
drilling a hole in his pile of bricks?

163
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,175
He doesn't like it.

164
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,263
He gives you a hard
time, you send him my way.

165
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,765
It's damn fine practice.

166
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,688
Hey, I got you a little something.

167
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,942
I was gonna wait until after the game...

168
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,656
100% leather.

169
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,742
That's steerhide in the
pocket and cowhide in the palm,

170
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,160
so it's nice and soft.

171
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:17,954
Try it on.

172
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,504
An all-star pitcher
deserves some all-star gear.

173
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,590
Come on, let's go break it in.

174
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,262
Wait.

175
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,515
Real quick, can I show
you my new wind-up?

176
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,937
All right, showboat.

177
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,564
Let's see it.

178
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,621
You're in the zone, Dex.
Keep throwing those heaters.

179
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,464
Strike!

180
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,801
Strike!

181
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,554
Strike!

182
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,598
Strike! Strike!

183
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,267
Strike!

184
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,897
All right, kiddo. Pack it in.
Let's give that arm of yours a rest.

185
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,482
You're pulling me?

186
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:33,362
- I'm gonna let Kanon finish it out.
- But... but no one's gotten a hit off me.

187
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,073
I know. You're killin'
it out here. No question.

188
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,576
But I gotta give other
kids some field time.

189
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,247
You can't do this. It's not
fair! You gotta let me keep going.

190
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,251
Keep it together, okay?
Take a few deep breaths.

191
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,337
Big gulps of air.

192
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,048
I need...

193
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,175
I need to keep going.

194
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:58,262
If I pitch a perfect
game, then they might...

195
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:06,896
Dex...

196
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,941
you could pitch a billion perfect games.

197
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,653
It won't bring your parents back.

198
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,618
Okay.

199
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,120
Hit the pine.

200
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,123
Grab a Popsicle.

201
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,875
We'll talk later.

202
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,178
Well, this has been
nice so far, hasn't it?

203
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,471
Talking like this.

204
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,742
Now that we've gotten to
know each other a little bit,

205
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,519
I wonder if we could
talk about Coach Bradley?

206
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,525
What happened at the field?

207
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,279
How did it make you feel?

208
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,573
Sad?

209
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,200
Maybe a little scared?

210
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,620
I wasn't sad.

211
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,622
Why not, do you think?

212
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,124
He was a jerk.

213
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:52,876
How so?

214
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,087
How was Coach Bradley a jerk?

215
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,383
He never let me do what I wanted.

216
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,344
Didn't know shit about pitching.

217
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:06,432
He was your coach for a long time.
Was he always such a jerk to you?

218
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,310
What about last year
when he named you MVP?

219
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,936
Was he a jerk then?

220
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,189
No. He used to be awesome.

221
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,823
Dex, tell me...

222
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,450
And be honest.

223
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,827
We like honesty around here.

224
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,917
When you hit Coach Bradley...

225
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,670
was that an accident?

226
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,426
Whatever you say stays
between us. That's the law.

227
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,642
No.

228
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,393
It wasn't an accident.

229
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,820
Am I in trouble?

230
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,780
No.

231
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:04,781
No.

232
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,992
It wasn't your fault.

233
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:11,413
But I just told you,
I did it on purpose.

234
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,207
That doesn't mean it was your fault.

235
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,585
It's confusing, isn't it?

236
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,463
Here, let me put it like this.

237
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,007
This is you, right?

238
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,091
Yeah.

239
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,760
This is fantastic.

240
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,305
But you see how alone you are?

241
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,351
It's just you, surrounded
by all this emptiness.

242
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,565
It's been that way for most
of your life, hasn't it?

243
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,276
Yeah.

244
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,654
I mean, most kids,
they have moms or dads

245
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,533
to teach them right from wrong,
to show them how to behave.

246
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,913
My parents mostly got mad at me.

247
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:53,997
Yes.

248
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,749
Then they died.

249
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,919
And there were things
that you never learned.

250
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,754
You see?

251
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,506
Not your fault.

252
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,468
Good news is, you've got me now.

253
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,323
Now, we've got a lot of work to do,

254
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:13,183
but I think that it is going to be fun.

255
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,521
We are going to establish some routines,

256
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,149
learn to stay calm.

257
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,403
And first things first,
we're gonna practice empathy.

258
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,487
What's that?

259
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,824
That means being kind to
someone when they're in pain.

260
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,568
So let's say, for example,

261
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:33,495
that my cat got sick this
morning and I was upset.

262
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,372
What would you say to me?

263
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:42,338
How about something like,
"I'm sorry. That sounds hard."

264
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,508
I'm sorry. That sounds really hard.

265
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,218
Look at you!

266
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,137
You even put a "really" in there.

267
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,348
I like a fast learner.

268
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,688
I think we are gonna make
a terrific team, you and me.

269
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,399
Oh.

270
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,613
Nothing marks an occasion
like a little bubbly, huh?

271
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,451
It's a... a Cava, actually.

272
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,078
Spanish champagne.

273
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:19,249
It was a little farewell gift from
the chiropractor down the hall.

274
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,753
Tomorrow is my last day in the building.

275
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,631
Here. Go on.

276
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,967
I'm not 21.

277
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,802
Good for you.

278
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:42,106
It's been quite a challenging day.

279
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,484
Quite a few goodbyes.

280
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,237
Lots of...

281
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,115
longtime clients.

282
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,783
That... That's hard.

283
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,202
That's really hard.

284
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,959
And then there's this,

285
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,212
our last session together,

286
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,298
which I've been dreading
since my prognosis.

287
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,134
Then don't leave.

288
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,595
We can keep meeting. I
can keep getting better.

289
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,097
Dex...

290
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,474
You can't leave.

291
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,893
You are gonna be fine, Dex.

292
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,354
We prepared for this.

293
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,567
You are gonna get a job
with a nice, rigid structure.

294
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,736
You're gonna stick to your meds.

295
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:34,533
And if you get off track,
you can... listen to these.

296
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,955
This is every session we've had.

297
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,541
Cycle through them again.

298
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,754
When we remind ourselves
of how far we've come,

299
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,881
we're less inclined to slip back.

300
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,842
And one last thing.

301
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,889
This is a, uh... a colleague of mine.

302
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:02,061
He's a fine therapist, with a lot
of expertise in your particular...

303
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,396
I don't want another therapist!

304
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,484
Are you trying to scare me?

305
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,110
No.

306
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,529
Not scare you.

307
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,531
Then what is your intention?

308
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,409
And be honest.

309
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,620
I want...

310
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,460
I want to kill you.

311
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,669
Say more.

312
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,380
Why do you want to kill me?

313
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,841
To put me out of my misery?

314
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,929
To punish you.

315
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,389
I'm not quite sure what I've done wrong.

316
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,810
I want to kill you for dying.

317
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,230
For leaving me.

318
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,693
Death always wins, Dex.

319
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,613
Eventually.

320
00:26:56,532 --> 00:27:01,537
But when it comes quietly and
naturally, it can be a beautiful event.

321
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:06,500
Which is why we never
hasten it with violence.

322
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,466
I can't do this alone.

323
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,389
You remember what I did?

324
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,851
Last time I was alone?

325
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,394
Then find someone.

326
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,187
I don't want another therapist!

327
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:30,107
Any good person with
a decent heart will do.

328
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,442
Someone to look up to.

329
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,282
Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.

330
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:43,579
It just works better when you
have the North Star to guide you.

331
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,724
Suicide Prevention, this is Dex.

332
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,142
Who am I speaking with?

333
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,021
Hi, Craig. How can I help you today?

334
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,943
I'm sorry. That's hard.
That's really hard.

335
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,780
Why don't you tell me a little
bit more about how you're feeling?

336
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,117
That's a lot to deal
with. I'm glad you called.

337
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,828
You're doing amazing.

338
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,500
Tell me, Craig,

339
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,837
are you thinking about taking
your own life right now?

340
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,505
Okay.

341
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,510
Do you have a plan?

342
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,522
What kind of gun do you have, Craig?

343
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,945
I'm familiar with the M11.

344
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:02,032
Did a couple years in the army.
Got real cozy with the M11.

345
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,243
It's reliable.

346
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,791
Let me ask you a question, Craig.

347
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,337
If this asshole stepdad of yours
is giving you so much grief,

348
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,756
why take your own life?

349
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,508
Why not...

350
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,470
Take a deep breath, Craig.

351
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,682
We're gonna work through this together.

352
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,559
I'm not going anywhere.

353
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,420
If I may ask, Mr. Fisk,

354
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,549
without getting into specifics,
what's this all about?

355
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,391
Right now, I am New York's scapegoat.

356
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,063
Downstairs, there are
protesters chanting prayers

357
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,940
to drive me out into the wilderness.

358
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:04,196
The attention that it brings
is an impediment for my plan.

359
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,950
Fortunately, the public
is easily distracted.

360
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,914
Which makes the solution
for my problem quite simple.

361
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,669
The city needs a new villain.

362
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,427
And I think I might've found him.

363
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,888
Can I start you off
with something to drink?

364
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,149
Looks like you need a little more time.

365
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,569
I'll grab you a water.

366
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,781
This is gonna sound random,

367
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,742
but did you used to work at
the Brooklyn Suicide Hotline?

368
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,165
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
That... was a tough job.

369
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,459
It was.

370
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:04,131
You probably don't
remember me. I'm Julie.

371
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,885
Dex.

372
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,930
Yeah, of course I remember you.

373
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,307
Small world, huh?

374
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,978
I haven't seen you in here before.

375
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,481
It's... it's my first day, actually.

376
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,608
I got offered double the
pay to leave my last job

377
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:27,195
if I could start here immediately.
Not that I'm complaining.

378
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,199
What about you? Are you
staying at the hotel?

379
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,286
No. I live here.

380
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,705
In New York, not in the hotel.

381
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,916
The FBI has an office upstairs.

382
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,295
We're guarding Wilson Fisk.

383
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,714
A G-man.

384
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,675
Excuse me, miss! Hello?

385
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,974
I need to go help that table so
they don't fire me on my first day.

386
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,518
What time do you get off?

387
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,605
In about an hour.

388
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,858
Do you wanna hang out after?

389
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,109
Catch up?

390
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,777
Uh...

391
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,655
Yeah.

392
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,116
That... That'd be great.

393
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,618
Hmm.

394
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,938
I got your coppa, your prosciutto,

395
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:28,215
your mocetta, your sweet soppressata.

396
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,175
All you can eat. Free!

397
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,053
For anybody who promises
to vote for Foggy Nelson,

398
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,180
my less handsome brother.

399
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,807
You can't do that, Theo.

400
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:41,353
It violates election law. It's
an illegal inducement to vote.

401
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,272
I don't see Mrs.
Wobschall calling the cops.

402
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,733
May I borrow a pen?

403
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,202
Is that an actual ballot, Mrs. Callahan?

404
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,371
I just voted for you.

405
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,455
Absentee.

406
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:05,252
When Wilson Fisk set off those
explosives in Hell's Kitchen,

407
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,503
I lost my husband.

408
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,880
Everything that matters, gone.

409
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,465
Except my vote.

410
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,136
I'm counting on you, Foggy.
You get that son of a bitch.

411
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,473
I will. I promise.

412
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,104
Thank you, everyone.

413
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,982
And I'll be here till close
to answer any questions.

414
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,359
Yeah, I got a few.

415
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:33,113
Like, what's the secret ingredient
in your world-famous Nelson's sub?

416
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,241
A soft robiola.

417
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,829
Perfect. Uh, team at
work is gonna love that.

418
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,912
Uh...

419
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,914
Give me six.

420
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:47,002
Uh, Theo can help you at the
counter. Is there anything else?

421
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,086
Yeah.

422
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,922
When's the last time
you saw Matt Murdock?

423
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,092
Who are you?

424
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,976
Crashing my campaign event,
trying to intimidate me,

425
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,312
dropping the names of my friends...

426
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:10,191
I'm not backing off my criticism
of the feds' love affair with Fisk!

427
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,196
You seem like a decent guy, Mr. Nelson.

428
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:19,284
You care about people.
About doing the right thing.

429
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,749
I'm guessing that's why
you ditched Matt Murdock

430
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,165
as your law partner in the first place.

431
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,458
Am I correct?

432
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,670
You really think I'm gonna
answer a question that leading?

433
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:34,049
To be clear: did you
dissolve your partnership

434
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,760
because Mr. Murdock took
on Wilson Fisk as a client?

435
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,012
If you're referring to a single case

436
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,599
where we represented a client
who allegedly worked for Fisk

437
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,435
even though we didn't
know that at the time...

438
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,603
the answer's no.

439
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,439
It had nothing to do with it.

440
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,275
Nelson and Murdock
represented a lot of clients,

441
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,862
for whom all work was
completely ethical and legal

442
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,281
and protected by
attorney-client privilege.

443
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,910
When's the last time
you saw Matt Murdock?

444
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:06,956
Two nights ago.

445
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,792
Where?

446
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,877
A bar in Hell's Kitchen.

447
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,545
And what did you discuss?

448
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,633
That we hadn't seen
each other in a while.

449
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,094
- Did he tell you where he was going?
- No.

450
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,720
- Where you could find him?
- No.

451
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,681
Did he tell you anything?

452
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,016
That he was sorry.

453
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,227
About what?

454
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,230
That our friendship
isn't what it used to be.

455
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,984
So you didn't knowingly
give him your bar ID?

456
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,611
What?

457
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,825
Of course not.

458
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,119
Why would I?

459
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,997
So he could enter a prison,
falsely using your identity,

460
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,041
and make contact with an Albanian gang

461
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,627
linked to the murder
of nine federal agents.

462
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,214
I...

463
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,676
I didn't give him my ID.

464
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,638
Nor was I aware of anything
that he was planning.

465
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,100
But with all due respect,

466
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,603
I think you have Matt Murdock all wrong.

467
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,063
Yeah, well, uh...

468
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,733
I don't think I do.

469
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,695
I think Matt Murdock
is hiding a double life.

470
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:22,198
Lawyer by day and criminal by night.

471
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,244
And you and Ms. Page
both know all about it.

472
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,456
It makes you uncomfortable.

473
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,707
And complicit.

474
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,586
And that's why you're no
longer law partners or friends.

475
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,629
Because once he's finally caught,

476
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:40,175
you know you're on the hook
as an accessory to his crimes.

477
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,845
Or, if you're lucky,
simply aiding and abetting.

478
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,892
Remind me, Special Agent Nadeem,

479
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,728
what's Matt being charged with?

480
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,980
Nothing so far.

481
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,106
Great.

482
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,986
Then the only thing I'm aiding
and abetting is your exit.

483
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,712
Don't forget to vote.

484
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,674
Every day?

485
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,719
FDR Drive's my favorite route, too.

486
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,363
There's nothing in the world like
a winter run on the East River.

487
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:31,518
Between your workout
habits and new gig, it's...

488
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,645
it's almost like you're stalking me.

489
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,856
Damn. The secret's out.

490
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,443
So...

491
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,196
why aren't you in social work anymore?

492
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,908
Uh... Tried to pursue
my dream as a dancer.

493
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,663
It actually was going pretty
well until I tore my ACL, again.

494
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,500
I'm sorry. That must've
been really hard.

495
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,086
But you were brave to go
for it in the first place.

496
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,046
I, um...

497
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,507
I didn't have a backup plan.

498
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,261
My parents made the mistake of telling
me I could be anything I wanted.

499
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,055
Must've been nice to hear,
even if it didn't work out.

500
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:15,228
My parents were never
really that involved.

501
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,524
Sounds like you didn't
need the message anyhow.

502
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,652
You did great all on your own.

503
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:32,370
So, what's it like
working for Wilson Fisk?

504
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:37,584
I don't work for him. I work
for the federal government.

505
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:44,048
Must be scary to be up close and
personal with someone so dangerous.

506
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,508
It is what it is.

507
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,263
Do you think a killer like
that deserves a second chance?

508
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,975
You worked at the
hotline for three years.

509
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,659
I think you of all people would believe

510
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,437
everyone deserves a second chance.

511
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,480
How did you know I worked
there for three years?

512
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,524
You were only there for one.

513
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,652
You mentioned it earlier.

514
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,906
You quit to do ballet.

515
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,283
Did I also mention ballet earlier?

516
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,410
Specifically?

517
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,914
I guess I... I just assumed.

518
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,293
Anyway, um...

519
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,880
It's late. I should get home.

520
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,381
You're ditching me?

521
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,342
No, not at all. I...

522
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,719
I just have to go feed my dog.

523
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,346
You don't have a dog.

524
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,223
How do you know that?

525
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,103
Julie, you're misreading this.

526
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,188
Let me pay for dinner.

527
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,482
We'll go for a walk in
the park. I'll explain.

528
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,691
Dinner's on me.

529
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,776
Julie.

530
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,236
You're very special to me.

531
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,696
Let go of me, Dex.

532
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,449
- Please.
- I said let go!

533
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,505
Just being at Matt's apartment,
and his bloody clothes...

534
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,839
And I just... It threw me.

535
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,826
Nadeem's smart. I probably
gave him everything he needs

536
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:10,927
to figure it out.

537
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,596
Wait. You told the FBI
that Matt is Daredevil?

538
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,056
No, no. Of course not.

539
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,601
They know he's hiding something.

540
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,365
It's not what they
think, but this is bad.

541
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,063
This is really bad. Infinitely bad.

542
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,582
- We could all go to jail.
- Foggy...

543
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,566
I should've never let
Matt tell you his secret.

544
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,402
This is my fault.

545
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,405
I'm not gonna let you pay
for our shitty mistakes.

546
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,907
If it comes to it, I'll plead
in exchange for your immunity.

547
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,117
Foggy...

548
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,204
You always see the good in people.

549
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:42,041
But you put us on such high pedestals,
you can't see who we really are.

550
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,920
I didn't tell the FBI Matt is
Daredevil. I did something worse.

551
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,672
Karen, breathe.

552
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,133
I'm in trouble.

553
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,759
Tell me what happened.

554
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,305
I'm gonna need attorney-client
privilege before I can.

555
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,727
Okay, um, give me five bucks.

556
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,030
Good enough. I'm officially your lawyer.

557
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,328
Do you remember the... the Healy trial?

558
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,459
And there was that...
that guy from... from CGI

559
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,296
who offered us a stupid amount
of money to take his case?

560
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,798
Yeah, how could I forget that creep?

561
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,301
His name's James Wesley.

562
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,720
He worked for Fisk.

563
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,806
He disappeared shortly after that,

564
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,770
and they think Matt had
something to do with it.

565
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,437
That's crazy. Matt had
nothing to do with that.

566
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,280
I know. But if they keep investigating,

567
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:48,150
they're gonna find out that I did.

568
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,691
What?

569
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,239
I killed him.

570
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,383
Shit. Shit.

571
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,373
It's good to see you,
Dex. How was your week?

572
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,667
I'm scared, Dr. Mercer.

573
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:15,087
Scared? What's making you scared?

574
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,707
Alpha Team on approach.

575
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,047
FBI. Get back in your
apartment and close the door.

576
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,054
Stack up.

577
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,889
Breach.

578
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:51,434
FBI!

579
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:52,976
Clear!

580
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,231
Murdock's been home.

581
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,358
Recently.

582
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,237
Command post, we're
clear. Suspect's not here.

583
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,159
NYPD has been advised. Citywide BOLO.

584
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,537
Suspect Matthew Murdock to be
considered armed and dangerous.
