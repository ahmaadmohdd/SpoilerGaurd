1
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,945
Nadeem!

2
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,391
Stay in the car!

3
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,454
Don't shoot! We surrender!

4
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,706
Convict. Don't move.

5
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:53,136
- Move! Move!
- Get back! Back it up!

6
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,179
I need to make a call.

7
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,388
Lobby's secure.

8
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,017
Straight to the nest! Move!

9
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,770
SAC's inbound. What the hell happened?

10
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,896
Ambush.

11
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,356
- They were everywhere.
- Do you have status on anyone?

12
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,987
Two agents in surgery now.
We lost five for this shitbag.

13
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,074
- Donovan!
- Stay back.

14
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,870
- We're his attorneys.
- Congratulations. Stay back.

15
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,872
Locate Vanessa.

16
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,247
The Albanians, they tried to
get me. They'll go for her, too.

17
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,794
My client is not implying

18
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,003
that he knows how to
reach a wanted fugitive.

19
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,632
And make sure she's safe!

20
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,903
We're good. Get the medic.

21
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,364
- He's fine.
- For me, not him.

22
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,033
Copy that. Shitbag's all yours.

23
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,578
Dex... Hold on.

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,038
Check in with the SAC.

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,083
We're down too many agents.
The debrief can wait.

26
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,668
You know the deal.

27
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,047
Follow the protocol
and get back here ASAP.

28
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,351
You will be confined to these quarters.

29
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,605
You'll be monitored at all times.

30
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,693
You are allowed no outside
contact other than your lawyers.

31
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,113
Armed guards will be
stationed outside 24/7.

32
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,580
You'll be safe here.

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,123
"Safe." You nearly had me killed.

34
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,169
Good men died tonight.

35
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,881
You will make their
sacrifice worth something.

36
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,260
Or you can shove our deal up your ass.

37
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,096
Hey, convict...

38
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,265
your lawyers are here.

39
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,236
Get dry.

40
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,489
Get dressed.

41
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,368
Did you reach her?

42
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,079
I need these cameras shut off
and a moment with my client.

43
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,161
- Forget about the cameras.
- Kill the cameras till they leave.

44
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,115
- Is Vanessa safe?
- We don't know.

45
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,054
She's missing.

46
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:45,388

47
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,919
Oh, God. I don't know, it's been...
uh, three months since I had one.

48
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,713
- See, now, that's bad.
- Yeah.

49
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,007
Yeah, it's been about a month for me.

50
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,175
I've been elbows deep in, uh, research,

51
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,803
but it feels like 100 years
since I had a home-cooked meal.

52
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,888
- This is all Uncle Mitchell.
- Please, stop.

53
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,516
Left to my own devices, we'd
be ordering Wo Hop every night.

54
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,602
- Nothing wrong with that.
- This woman does it all.

55
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:17,523
Not only does she run Proxy
Magazine, she is an expert orderer.

56
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,317
- Stop it.
- No, it's true.

57
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,193
You're amazing. It's like a skill.

58
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,487
Right? You know all the
best dishes on every menu.

59
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,049
You always order the right
amount. Never too much, too little.

60
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:27,074
It's perfect.

61
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,827
- He'd be lost without me.
- I would.

62
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,913
- Disgusting.
- Are they always like this?

63
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,249
When I was eight, they renewed
their vows on Long Beach

64
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,917
- in front of the whole family.
- No.

65
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,211
Aunt Lily hired one of those
planes that write in the sky.

66
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,322
- Oh, my God. Did you really?
- I did.

67
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:45,176
- So, how did you two meet?
- Kind of like you guys, actually.

68
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,181
We were set up by our
college newspaper editor.

69
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,518
Oh. Mitchell, did you not tell them?

70
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,396
- Uncle Mitchell...
- I am so sorry. I had no idea.

71
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,692
I had no... I was... I
had nothing to do with it.

72
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,654
You know what? Uh, we
need... We need more wine.

73
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,700
- Really?
- I get it. I'm sorry.

74
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,659
You know...

75
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,871
I knew that if I had actually
asked you, you'd have said no.

76
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,374
Right. See, that's the part
where it gets to be my choice.

77
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,875
I know you meant well, but this...

78
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,213
- You could use some happy.
- I am happy.

79
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,678
Look, I'm not, um... I'm not ready.

80
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,102
All right, well, if you want
to leave, I'll understand.

81
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,730
I'm sure Jason will, too.

82
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,952
So, wait. You're telling me
that you named your cat Ralph?

83
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,827
- Ellison.
- Oh.

84
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:57,282
Hey! I have a PhD in Am
Lit. He's my favorite author.

85
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:01,209
"Life is to be lived, not
controlled. Humanity is won by..."

86
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,089
I know this one, actually...

87
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:07,424
"Humanity is won by continuing to
play in the face of certain defeat."

88
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,428
Is that right?

89
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,428
How do you know the quote?

90
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,388
I was going to be an English major.

91
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,349
Invisible Man would have been
a big part of my curriculum,

92
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,966
but that was another lifetime.

93
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,603
You made out okay.

94
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,273
A revered journalist with
an acclaimed publication.

95
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,233
- Okay.
- Too much, honey.

96
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,747
So, tell me, you ever worry little
Ralph's plotting your demise?

97
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,949
- I take it you're a dog person.
- Absolutely.

98
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,705
I don't know, I like the company.
Shared a room with my brother growing up.

99
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,414
The apartment felt
empty till I got Ralph.

100
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,751
How about you? Any, uh, siblings?

101
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,752
- Uh. More wine?
- Um...

102
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,881
Yeah. No, I had a
brother, too, but, um...

103
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,507
but he died.

104
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,761
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

105
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,763
- Who wants dessert?
- That'd be great. Thank you.

106
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,852
Sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Ellison.

107
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,606
Uh, sorry.

108
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,986
Karen Page.

109
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,824
Who in the hell would let out Fisk?

110
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:13,121
Don't say his name.

111
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,241
What? Why?

112
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,995
After Ben died, Lily was
inconsolable. They were really close.

113
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,066
And, you know, it
turned out that somebody

114
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,327
at my office had been working for him.

115
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,919
We'd gotten to the point
where an hour could go by,

116
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,296
and I didn't have to call
to reassure that I'm alive.

117
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,589
- I understand.
- Good.

118
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,659
Then you won't push
back when I tell you,

119
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:32,760
you are staying away from this story.

120
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,136
I can't do that.

121
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,901
Yes, you can. And you will.

122
00:08:35,904 --> 00:08:38,430
Look, I get it. I have a
history with... that man.

123
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:40,142
- Makes it a conflict of interest.
- Exactly.

124
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,371
But I also know him better
than anyone else on our staff.

125
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:43,920
Doesn't that give me a unique angle?

126
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:48,479
It gives you a bias. Look, it's not
up for discussion. Enjoy the pie.

127
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,786
And, darling, that is not
a dress, that is a disaster.

128
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,664
I worked on it with all the
materials available to me,

129
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,666
and I did the best with the time...

130
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,129
Baby...

131
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,261
What was it this time? Laughing Matt?

132
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,223
Body Matt.

133
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:23,854
Foggy Bear, whatever happened
to Matt, it's not your fault.

134
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,358
You have nothing to feel guilty about.

135
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:30,608
Because I have this great life?

136
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,448
Beautiful girlfriend, high-paying
job, expensive suits...

137
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,411
I always wanted a good suit.

138
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:42,388
I have it all, but Matt's just...

139
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,253
gone.

140
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,883
Maybe you should talk to someone.

141
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,053
It won't bring him back.

142
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,347
But it might help you.

143
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,979
I can't.

144
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,523
Why not?

145
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,115
Sorry. Go back to your brief.

146
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,496
Take a pill. There's some
in the medicine cabinet.

147
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,464
No. No. No.

148
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,678
Lock Fisk up! Lock Fisk up!

149
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,349
Lock Fisk up! Lock Fisk up!

150
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,290
Doesn't make any sense.

151
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,463
Of course it does.
God is angry with you.

152
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,675
What are you talking about?

153
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,305
You don't think God knows
you tried to kill yourself?

154
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,433
No.

155
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,437
That has nothing to do with this.

156
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,524
God restored your hearing...

157
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,777
just in time to hear my
name chanted by the crowds.

158
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,617
Just in time to learn, in
the long run, I won, you lost.

159
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,745
Does that sound like God's forgiveness?

160
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,249
No.

161
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,003
It sounds like... hell.

162
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,464
Lock Fisk up! Lock Fisk up!

163
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,055
You'll never keep Karen safe.

164
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,978
- In the end, you'll kill her, too.
- Stop it.

165
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,770
Just like your father.

166
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,731
- And Stick.
- I said stop.

167
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,943
And Elektra.

168
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,865
They all died because of you, Matthew.

169
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,622
I can't believe this. This is insane.

170
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,001
You're that reporter.

171
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,920
Sorry. Karen Page, Bulletin.

172
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,259
Uh... Sorry, who's in charge here?

173
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,386
That's the genius who
got him out. Agent Nadeem.

174
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,389
Thanks.

175
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,060
Agent Nadeem.

176
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,190
Soon as I'm done here. There's
a vigil at the hospital.

177
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,320
Just give Sami a hug for me. You, too.

178
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,492
Hi. Karen Page of the New York Bulletin.

179
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,201
I'm not authorized
to speak to the press.

180
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,536
You need to find Special
Agent In Charge Hattley.

181
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,747
But it is N-A-D-E-E-M, right?

182
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,751
And you're the agent
who released Wilson Fisk?

183
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,252
Fisk has not been
released. That's fake news.

184
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,129
He's a cooperating witness,

185
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,299
but he's very much a convicted
prisoner and being treated as such.

186
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,926
Being held in a $20 million penthouse?

187
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,575
Seized by the US Government from some

188
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,221
Wall Street prick convicted of fraud.

189
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,765
Oh. Oh, I get it. Okay, so
what's he having for dinner?

190
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,935
Is it the filet mignon or
the line-caught halibut?

191
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,270
Press area is over there.

192
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,900
One RICO count carries
a 20-year sentence.

193
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,655
Fisk was convicted on five. Want to
explain to me how this is justice?

194
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,619
Jennings, Garcia,
Foster, Leighton, Torres.

195
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,456
They lost their lives, and they
were good agents, good people.

196
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,334
Write about that, Ms. Page.

197
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,681
All right...

198
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,850
get it up there.

199
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,853
- All right?
- Yeah. Okay.

200
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,066
Excuse us. Watch yourself.

201
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,750
Nine-one-seven-four.

202
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,858
Thanks.

203
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,537
Oh. Hey, man, hand me one
of those BNCs, would ya?

204
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,545
Thanks. Dude, I said a BNC...

205
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,887
Yes, I've checked three
times. I have the tickets.

206
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,181
Okay, okay. I just wanted to be sure.

207
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,186
With this mess outside, we
don't wanna have to come back.

208
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,735
- Do you think we're safe?
- We should check out.

209
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,571
We booked this months ago.
Now we have to deal with this?

210
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,948
We're checking out early.

211
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,950
We are very sorry for the disruption.

212
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,118
Can we assist you in making
reservations elsewhere?

213
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,579
Do you know who I am?
You know who he is, right?

214
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,999
Just one moment, sir.

215
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,302
Watch rotation. Sound off.

216
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,975
North entrance is green.

217
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,634
West entrance is green.

218
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,316
Service area is green.

219
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,725
Lobby is green.

220
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,609
So, you're inside. Now what?

221
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,530
Why would they let you out?

222
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,738
Does it matter?

223
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,784
The real question is, when you find
me, what are you prepared to do?

224
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,206
See, if the FBI are protecting
you, that means you cut a deal.

225
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,711
With everything I know
about crime in this city...

226
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,378
the FBI will be eating out of my hand.

227
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,006
- You'll manipulate them.
- You don't know that.

228
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,843
I know you.

229
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,302
Maybe prison has changed me.

230
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,596
Maybe right this moment

231
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,893
I'm giving the FBI information
that will save lives.

232
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,398
While you're here doing
what? Whatever this is.

233
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,066
Wouldn't that be something?

234
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,572
If I became more valuable to
this city than you ever were.

235
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,043
Garcia was the best man at my wedding.

236
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,345
Word is Andrews will pull through.

237
00:17:57,348 --> 00:18:00,746
If you call probably never going
to walk again pulling through.

238
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,886
That's hard. That's really hard.

239
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,298
And he gets a penthouse.

240
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:18,198
Shut the cameras off, please.
We need time with our client.

241
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,070
And?

242
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,531
We reached Felix
Manning. Vanessa's safe.

243
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,200
Her bodyguards relocate
her every 72 hours,

244
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,286
and they take precautions
to avoid being tracked.

245
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,164
No cell phones. It's why
they were unreachable.

246
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,332
Where is she now?

247
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,837
A safe house outside Barcelona.

248
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,782
Felix hid her in Spain?

249
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,468
It was her decision.

250
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,222
We strongly advised against
Europe, given the extradition risk,

251
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,145
but Ms. Marianna enjoys the art
and she can be very insistent.

252
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,402
Yes, she can.

253
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,367
But it's too easy for the
Albanians to get at her there.

254
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,537
Call Felix.

255
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,000
Tell him to put Vanessa
some place safer.

256
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,336
Some place closer.

257
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,738
"Homicides are down,
burglaries down, assaults down.

258
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,774
I have not accomplished this alone.

259
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:04,993
The good people of Hell's
Kitchen have said no more.

260
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,063
Together with the NYPD,

261
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,664
we have begun to take
our neighborhoods back.

262
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,313
Reelect me for district attorney,

263
00:20:11,316 --> 00:20:14,485
and let's continue
to take our city back.

264
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:15,923
Together."

265
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,299
How was that?

266
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,593
Too many "togethers."
Sounds like a Beatles' song.

267
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,511
Okay, but is that good?

268
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,514
No.

269
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,436
- Wow. I'm inspired.
- Mr. Nelson.

270
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,813
Mr. Tower, you need to get ready.

271
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,192
I believe a $1,500 contribution
buys me ten minutes.

272
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,028
It doesn't buy you anything,
but I'll give you five.

273
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,530
- Arlene, I said the blue one.
- It had a stain.

274
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,866
The charcoal's the ticket. Trust me.

275
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,453
You have five minutes.

276
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,166
So, what can I do for you?

277
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,794
It's what I can do for you.

278
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,544
The Wilson Fisk case.

279
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:00,882
I want to provide my complete,
unmitigated, fully caffeinated support.

280
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,217
I'm sorry, the Fisk case?

281
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,302
I know you're doing
everything in your power

282
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,721
to reverse the terms of
that crap deal he finagled.

283
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,516
But you're under-resourced
and I'm over-resourced.

284
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,686
Like, obscenely over-resourced.

285
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,940
All this to say, I'm drafting
myself onto your team for this.

286
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,944
So tag me the hell in.

287
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,946
Maybe just a nod?

288
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,864
- Mr. Nelson...
- Foggy.

289
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,658
I already fought this tooth and nail.

290
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,119
I objected to Mr. Fisk's
house incarceration

291
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,996
on every ground imaginable.

292
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,371
I assumed as much.

293
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,792
So I did some digging, and
if we can open a state case,

294
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,627
we can at least put
him back behind bars.

295
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,714
At least for a while, which
will buy us time to build...

296
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,048
It's just not feasible.

297
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,813
I'll do research.
Late-night strategizing.

298
00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:47,017
All pro bono, of course. Soup to nuts.

299
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,472
Nelson reporting for duty, sir.

300
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,977
Fisk is cooperating with
the federal government.

301
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,746
There's nothing I can do.

302
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:58,246
I know you know the difference between
a good fight and a losing battle.

303
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:01,108
I know that sometimes
they're the same thing.

304
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,029
And you don't know which battle you're
fighting until you're fighting it.

305
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,322
Well, I'm moving on.

306
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,970
You should, too.

307
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:10,577
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to go change for an interview.

308
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,246
So that's it? You're
just gonna roll over?

309
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,460
No, I'm just gonna do my job.
And your five minutes are up.

310
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,170
Would you care more if you
weren't trying to get reelected?

311
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,463
Watch it, Counselor.

312
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,258
Fisk had Ms. Cardenas killed.

313
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,385
Maybe you don't give a damn,

314
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,635
because she's dead
and can't vote for you,

315
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,971
but she was a good person.

316
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,668
She cared about her community,

317
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:34,768
was braver than both of us put together.

318
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,314
Fisk will hurt more people like her.

319
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:42,150
She didn't have a voice, because
the people in power didn't care.

320
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,738
You're supposed to be
Ms. Cardenas's voice.

321
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,411
Leave... or I'm calling security.

322
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,582
I'm going.

323
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,418
But I'm canceling my check.

324
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:05,340
Prison, not a penthouse!
Prison, not a penthouse!

325
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,683
Chow is on the way, guys.

326
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,945
Mickey D's?

327
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,822
You think DOJ is going to
cover $40 tuna melts for us?

328
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,407
Just a coffee, please.

329
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,369
Save me something. I'm up in ten.

330
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,955
Penthouse, please.

331
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,418
It's got the best view.

332
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,918
You should be rotting in a cell.

333
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,297
So you're gonna bring me back to prison?

334
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,260
But you know that won't work.

335
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,474
There's only one way to stop
me, but you're not gonna do it.

336
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,977
Are you sure about that?

337
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,310
In a way, you're my accomplice.

338
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:03,942
Everything that's happened since
you refused to kill me is on you.

339
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,529
The bodies that I've stacked up.

340
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,240
The ones to come.

341
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,453
- I wonder who's next?
- You have the routing number.

342
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,998
Two million. In euros.

343
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,333
No, today. My client
is not a patient man.

344
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:26,256
You can follow him right
to me. You know you want to.

345
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,389
- May I see your room key, sir?
- Yeah, I got it.

346
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,349
No, I need to see it.

347
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,851
Oh, sure. Yeah.

348
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,688
You can take him. Grab his gun.

349
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,690
Come for me. I'm caged up. Unarmed.

350
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,651
- Sir.
- They gave me, like, three of them.

351
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,985
But you won't.

352
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:55,368
You can't kill me. You
can't even kill yourself.

353
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,996
You know what? I must
have left it in my car.

354
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,625
Then I can't let you through.

355
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,086
Sure, I...

356
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,339
I'll be right back.

357
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,055
Pharmacy service,
please call station four.

358
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,809
Pharmacy service,
please call station four.

359
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,490
Doctor Brenner, 241.

360
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,038
I'm so sorry.

361
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,006
Hey, boss.

362
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,971
Andrews is back under the knife.
They think they can save his liver.

363
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,767
Good. Good. That's good.

364
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,854
I wanted to give blood, but...

365
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,732
I wasn't sure if I should show my face.

366
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,858
Nobody blames you.

367
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,360
I blame me.

368
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,571
Moving Fisk was my call.

369
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,072
Because I pushed for it.

370
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,410
Because it was the smart thing to do.

371
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,998
Because we signed up to protect people.

372
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,708
And this is what it
looks like sometimes.

373
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,752
Think of all the times this won't
happen because of what we're doing.

374
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,090
Not to civilians. Not to us.

375
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,303
Hold on to all the lives we're saving.

376
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:41,877
They matter... just as much
as the one's we've lost.

377
00:26:46,596 --> 00:26:47,689
Yeah.

378
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,351
Bon appétit, asshole.

379
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,701
It's Special Agent Poindexter, isn't it?

380
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,412
You saved my life last night.

381
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,541
Yeah, we all make mistakes.

382
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,298
I'm sorry for the loss
of your fellow agents.

383
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,803
Losing them to protect
someone like me...

384
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:07,268
must be particularly difficult for
the families and the loved ones.

385
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,148
I'd offer my condolences...

386
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,695
but I imagine it brings them
greater comfort to hate me.

387
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,660
Unless you feel otherwise.

388
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,956
That my words might
bring any positive effect.

389
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,127
If so, please share that,
from what I witnessed,

390
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,128
they were incredibly brave.

391
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,466
Might wanna eat faster,
convict. The meal's over in five.

392
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:44,889
I owe those fallen agents a debt...

393
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,977
that I can never repay.

394
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,065
But...

395
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,320
I also owe you.

396
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,326
I've known extraordinary people.

397
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,622
But I've never seen a talent like yours.

398
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:16,838
May I ask you where you
acquired such a skill?

399
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,175
Okay. You're done.

400
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,270
I saved him 'cause it was my job.

401
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,938
What more do you want me to say, Doc?

402
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,027
Forget Fisk. Talk to
me about the ambush.

403
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,821
What about it?

404
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,822
Come on, Poindexter, we
both know how this works.

405
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,283
We have to talk so I
can clear you for duty.

406
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,286
It is what it is.

407
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,370
I lost friends today.

408
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,123
And you used lethal force
against multiple suspects.

409
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,500
- Yeah.
- And you're on duty

410
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,502
even though you should be
on administrative leave.

411
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,378
I understand you're
trying to do your job,

412
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,548
but if I were wearing a mask, the
press would be calling me a hero.

413
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,760
Instead, I'm sitting here trying
to justify protecting myself.

414
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,972
I'm not the enemy. I'm just trying to...

415
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,266
Look, forget the psych
bullshit for a minute.

416
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:16,272
Just tell me for real, how are you?

417
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,571
It's hard.

418
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,155
It's really hard.

419
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,408
This isn't the first time
you've used lethal force.

420
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,746
I'm FBI SWAT, Doc. What
do you think a sniper does?

421
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:37,458
Well, the thing is,
Dex... Can I call you Dex?

422
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,254
The thing is, events
like this exact a toll.

423
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,775
Repeating traumatic experiences

424
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:44,882
compounds that toll,
creating a pressure.

425
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,301
Until one day I go
postal? Yeah, I get it.

426
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,304
The point is, you have
to process this stuff.

427
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,639
I process it.

428
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,518
Do you have a support system?

429
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,979
Well, I think she'd
rather be called Julie.

430
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,692
Oh. Well, tell me, how does that work?

431
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,153
She's a bartender.

432
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,781
Professional listener, like you.

433
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,996
She probably gets paid more.

434
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,244
Tell me about her.

435
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,663
We get dinner most nights.

436
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,208
Today's Tuesday?

437
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,542
It's pizza night.

438
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,087
Julie gets broccoli with
sausage, extra cheese.

439
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,716
I tell her about my day.

440
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,133
The good, the bad.

441
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,386
I know it's not healthy to
hold this stuff in, so...

442
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,764
I talk to her.

443
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,975
I tell her everything.

444
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,559
And...

445
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,689
And she doesn't judge me or blame me.

446
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,276
She's just... there for me.

447
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,529
She sounds like a good one.

448
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,198
Yeah, she is.

449
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,037
All right. You are clear for duty.

450
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,583
But I want you checking in
with me daily for a while. Okay?

451
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,836
Yes, sir.

452
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:07,300
You, uh... You go see your
girl. It'll do you good.

453
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,239
Why did Fisk flip on the Albanians?

454
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,829
I don't know what you're talking about.

455
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:36,079
You've got the wrong person.

456
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,082
Fisk hated prison. The FBI got him out.

457
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,251
No, no. He could have turned
on anyone. Why the Albanians?

458
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,711
I'm just a lawyer.

459
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:50,007
What is Fisk really getting out of
this? Is it the Albanians' territory?

460
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,801
- No.
- Is it money?

461
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,804
No.

462
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,597
Why don't you let me know
when you wanna breathe?

463
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,854
Fisk's woman.

464
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,355
The feds will drop all
charges against her.

465
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,902
- No.
- I swear! He's doing it all for her.

466
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,323
And where is Vanessa?

467
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,118
- Where you wanna eat?
- How about the Chinese place?

468
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,996
- Help! Help!
- Over there! Go! Let's go!

469
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,999
Help!

470
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,210
He's an Albanian.

471
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,045
There's an unidentified
assailant in the parking deck,

472
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,839
considered armed and dangerous.

473
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,731
Anyone got a visual on him?

474
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,307
Nothing yet.

475
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,342
Moving to the south side of the garage.

476
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,895
We're in stairwell H, heading
down to parking level three.

477
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,108
We need backup on parking level three.

478
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,030
Repeat, we need backup
on parking level three.

479
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,700
Stop! FBI!

480
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,410
They have families, asshole.

481
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,372
Listen. I'm not here to...

482
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,045
- There he is! Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

483
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,719
Come out with your hands up. Now.

484
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,493
Stay down, man.

485
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,963
Oh, God.

486
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,008
That's it. Let the Devil out.

487
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,770
Felt good, didn't it? Too
bad you still can't get at me.

488
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,941
Not with the FBI protecting me.

489
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,288
I'm going to kill everyone you love,

490
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,657
and there's nothing you can do about it.

491
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,893
Paper goes to bed in 20 minutes.

492
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,187
- You got 15 seconds.
- Okay. It's big.

493
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,688
- Shit. Fisk.
- No, look...

494
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,399
God damn it. I explicitly
told you not to do that.

495
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,193
- I didn't set out to.
- Stop.

496
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,904
Mason saw you at the hotel.

497
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:44,533
I mean, I know Fisk is important
to you. I know. I don't care. Okay?

498
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,827
I assign the stories, and
I gave this one to Mason.

499
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,291
I wasn't there on that story. I
was there on my story. Kazemis?

500
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,628
Look, I think there's a connection.

501
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,461
What do you mean?

502
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,504
Do you know who used to
own the Presidential Hotel?

503
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,215
- No.
- The Kazemis.

504
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,969
I don't have proof yet, but you
know who I think owns it now?

505
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,138
Wilson Fisk.

506
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,606
- Tell me.
- Okay.

507
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,233
Look, I got a lead.

508
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,237
So the Presidential Hotel is owned
by these nested shell companies.

509
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,697
It's just one company who
owns another and another...

510
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,409
Anyway, I tracked them from here
to the Caymans to Luxembourg.

511
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,827
And this connects to Fisk how?

512
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,287
Because all of those companies,

513
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,707
they're all represented here in
the United States by one law firm.

514
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,211
Donovan and Partners.

515
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,505
Fisk's lawyers.

516
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,631
Okay, keep going.

517
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,353
All right, here's what
I've pieced together.

518
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:44,218
Six months ago,

519
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,472
one of these shell companies buys
the Presidential Hotel from Kazemi.

520
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,767
A week ago, he tells his
family that he regrets the sale

521
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,520
and announces his intention
to buy the hotel back.

522
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,064
And two days later,
Kazemi gets attacked.

523
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:00,609
Yes. Yes, exactly. Now, I don't
think that timing is coincidental.

524
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,278
I just...

525
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,823
I can feel Fisk is behind this.
Right? I feel it in my bones.

526
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,577
I need two days to
get everything vetted,

527
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,289
then I'll have a story that you can run.

528
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,496
- It's excellent. Outstanding work, Karen.
- Thank you.

529
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,581
Really.

530
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,002
Yeah.

531
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,671
- I'm giving it to Mason. I told you.
- What? No, I know, I'm biased.

532
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:24,049
Of course! Of course I'm biased.
Fisk tried to have me killed.

533
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,802
He also killed Ben, which
makes you as biased as me.

534
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,431
If people see your name and
know your connection to Fisk,

535
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,017
it compromises this paper!

536
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,506
Fine. Give the byline to Mason.
I don't give a shit about credit.

537
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:38,967
What I give a shit about is
Fisk getting out of prison.

538
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:43,402
We have to do something... I
have to do something about this.

539
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,364
So don't tell me to
back off, 'cause I won't.

540
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,913
You know, it took Ben decades to
become this much of a pain in my ass.

541
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,108
Well, at least you're upright.

542
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,909
Do I even wanna know?

543
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,123
Do you believe people can change?

544
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,794
I'm still holding out hope.

545
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,131
I donâ€™t think we can.

546
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,717
Not really.

547
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,847
I think we come into
this world who we are.

548
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,142
And maybe we get a little nicer.

549
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,978
Or a little angrier.

550
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,858
But we can't change
our fundamental nature.

551
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,116
Well, you'd actually
have to try to know.

552
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,077
I was talking about Wilson Fisk.

553
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,123
So your hearing's really back, then?

554
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,002
Well, what do you know? Maybe
the boss did hear my prayers.

555
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,670
Yeah, or my curses.

556
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,715
Please don't start with Job again.

557
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,343
You gotta admit it's
interesting, though, isn't it?

558
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,762
I finally get my full hearing back,

559
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,101
and the first thing I hear is
that Wilson Fisk is out of prison.

560
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,269
So you're suggesting that

561
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,357
God set a dangerous mobster
free just to spite you?

562
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:46,193
Nah.

563
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,196
Probably just a coincidence.

564
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,867
Because that would be
incredibly narcissistic.

565
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,168
Fisk claims to be helping the FBI.

566
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,087
But they don't know him like I do.

567
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,758
Right. And according to
you, people can't change.

568
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,764
'Cause he's claiming to
have changed over a woman.

569
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,558
I see.

570
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:24,023
Well, if there's anything
that can redeem a lost soul,

571
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,690
love would have to top the list.

572
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,777
Oh, come on. Even a monster like Fisk?

573
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,571
You're talking to a nun, kiddo.

574
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,199
Love and redemption are
pretty much our sales pitch.

575
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,619
Yeah. Well, I'm not buying.

576
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,247
So, what are you gonna do?

577
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,169
I don't know.

578
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,423
Maybe I'll stop him.

579
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,843
For good this time.

580
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,103
Well, just be careful that
you don't become the monster.

581
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,649
Foggy.

582
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,446
This isn't real.

583
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,215
It's real.

584
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,910
Hey, Foggy.

585
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:32,211
How? Where have... We
all thought you were dead.

586
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,296
I'm sorry.

587
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,425
- Does Karen know you're back yet?
- Take a seat.

588
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,387
I'm...

589
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,348
I'm not back.

590
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:47,004
Well, I'm 75% sure
I'm not hallucinating.

591
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:49,903
I'm, uh... not back.

592
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,858
Matt Murdock isn't gonna be
a part of me anymore. Um...

593
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,527
- I'm leaving him behind.
- What?

594
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,950
The only reason I came here
was to warn you and Karen...

595
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,071
that Fisk is out and
you're both in danger.

596
00:45:06,074 --> 00:45:08,918
- Dude...
- I've had a rough couple of months, Foggy.

597
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,500
Questioning a lot of...

598
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:15,052
The point of it all.

599
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,341
And last night, everything became clear.

600
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:25,512
I'm going after him, Foggy. I'm
gonna find a way to bring Fisk down.

601
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,140
But I can only do that if I
know you and Karen are safe.

602
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,933
Dude, slow down.

603
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,894
I'm still processing that
you're, like, even sitting here.

604
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,815
I know you're gonna
want to get involved.

605
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,067
You and Karen will try
and fight Fisk in some way.

606
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,154
I'm telling you,

607
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,741
I need you to stay out
of it and leave it to me.

608
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,911
No.

609
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,123
- "No"?
- No.

610
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,805
You don't get to show up like
this and say something like that

611
00:45:54,808 --> 00:45:56,628
and expect me to be cool with it.

612
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,289
You're my best friend, asshole.

613
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:01,469
I see I was wrong to become your friend.

614
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,888
I... I put you in danger,
and it was selfish of me.

615
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:10,280
I can't change the past, but I
can stop making the same mistake.

616
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,812
We're done, buddy.
It's, uh... It's over.

617
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,233
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

618
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,859
Yeah, I know.

619
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,580
Stay clear of Fisk. Tell
Karen to do the same.

620
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:25,818
And I'd appreciate it if you
didn't tell her you saw me.

621
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,534
- Do you even hear yourself right now?
- Goodbye, Foggy.

622
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,205
Matt! Matt!

623
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,066
Was it him?

624
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,943
He took out six feds.

625
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,365
He wasn't in a red suit,
but, yeah, it was him.

626
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,706
So the Devil is back.

627
