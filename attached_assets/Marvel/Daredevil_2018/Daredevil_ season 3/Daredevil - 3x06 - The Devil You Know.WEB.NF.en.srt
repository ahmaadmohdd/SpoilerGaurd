2
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,674
Karen, the gun. Where is it?

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,175
Bottom of the Hudson.

4
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,426
Did you touch the body?

5
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,887
He said he was gonna kill you.

6
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,849
You and Matt and my family.

7
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,853
He said I would die knowing
I got you all killed.

8
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:04,064
Karen, that's awful, but,
please, you have to focus.

9
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,983
Did you touch the body?

10
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,570
No. I don't think so.

11
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,333
What about your clothes?
Get blood on them?

12
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,405
I threw them away.

13
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,367
Foggy, can you not talk to
me like a lawyer and just...

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,911
just talk to me?

15
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,499
I want you to tell me
that I'm a bad person.

16
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,792
I can't say that.

17
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,714
Why... why not?

18
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,924
Because you're not.

19
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,096
Then why are you
looking at me like that?

20
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,352
Because my friend...

21
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,899
my amazing, kind, brilliant friend...

22
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,360
went through something terrible.

23
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,821
And I didn't know.

24
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,371
When I got the gun, I
could've called the cops.

25
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,868
I could've run.

26
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,622
You were afraid for your
life. It was self-defense.

27
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,335
Seven times.

28
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,254
What?

29
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,966
I shot him...

30
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,802
seven times...

31
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,889
because I wanted him dead.

32
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,958
Hey, Karen.

33
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,133
You need to pay me back for your rent.

34
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,551
I've been staying where I grew up.

35
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,096
There's a reason I stayed away, Karen.

36
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,641
Yeah, if you say it was to protect
me, I'm seriously gonna throw up.

37
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,518
I can't protect you.

38
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,854
Not from Fisk.

39
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,065
Can't even protect myself.

40
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,110
Sure you don't want coffee?

41
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,488
If you wanna yell at me...

42
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,365
go right ahead.

43
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,875
Did I ever tell you about my old
neighbor, when I was growing up?

44
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,835
Mr. Larssen.

45
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,214
Well, he was this nice Norwegian guy.

46
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,049
He let his wife do his talking.

47
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,712
But on the days when
it'd get really cold

48
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:02,761
you know, and stuff would freeze,

49
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:07,349
and you'd need help moving your
car or, uh... unstick a door,

50
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,975
Mr. Larssen was always there.

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,603
So, one winter, his wife
hit a patch of black ice.

52
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,357
The whole town turned
out for her funeral.

53
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,319
And Mr. Larssen sat there
through the sermon...

54
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,280
and then he gathered up his casseroles

55
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,534
and went back to work on the
farm, like it was just another day.

56
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,817
He never said a word about it.

57
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,287
And I thought I'd go over
there and be a good neighbor...

58
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,998
see if he wanted to
talk about what happened.

59
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,543
And you know what he said?

60
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:39,965
"What for?"

61
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,275
You know what?

62
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,238
You came to Foggy because
you needed something from him.

63
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,618
What do you need from me, Matt?

64
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,498
Fisk staged the attack
on himself in prison.

65
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,172
That's how he, uh, tricked the
FBI into moving him to a hotel.

66
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:27,637
Got some lifer named
Jasper Evans to shank him

67
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,557
and then arranged for
him to walk out of prison.

68
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,812
On the books, Evans is in solitary.

69
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,356
In reality, he's been set free.

70
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,319
- Can you prove that?
- Yeah, if I can find him.

71
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,989
Get him to talk to you.

72
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,284
Bulletin publishes the
details. Fisk is exposed.

73
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,787
And the FBI will be forced
to send him back to prison.

74
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,585
So, yeah, you're right. I came
to you 'cause I needed something.

75
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,756
Your help.

76
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,345
What do you say? You wanna help me?

77
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,349
No.

78
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,935
And I'm serious about the rent.

79
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,822
You probably don't
remember me. I'm Julie.

80
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,992
Do you wanna hang out after?

81
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,120
How did you know I worked
there for three years?

82
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,664
You were only there for one.

83
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,458
Let go of me, Dex.

84
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,709
I said let go!

85
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,545
Let go of me, Dex. I said let go!

86
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,585
Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.

87
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,380
It just works better with
a North Star to guide you.

88
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,049
What if I can't find one?

89
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,010
Then you'll rely on our structure.

90
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,346
A tidy physical space.
A disciplined vocation...

91
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,486
This paper takes its sourcing seriously.

92
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,781
We don't publish unverified
innuendo, you know?

93
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,990
Gossip...

94
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,036
Ah, Ms. Page. Yeah, I'm
not boring you, am I?

95
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,958
Anyway, in other news,
our illustrious publisher,

96
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,376
in his infinite wisdom,

97
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,379
has decided to change our
health care coverage, yet again.

98
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,660
You should be getting
your enrollment packages

99
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:32,841
sometime in the next week.

100
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,880
I've already had a look at it.

101
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:37,303
My advice to you is,
try not to get sick.

102
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,348
Uh, any questions?

103
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,026
It's total bullshit. I can't
believe Matt would even ask.

104
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,821
- But I still think you should help him.
- Oh, come on.

105
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,030
Just hear me out.

106
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,491
You agree to write the
article on one condition.

107
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,618
Matt turns himself in to the FBI.

108
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,870
What? No.

109
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,707
They're only up in our chili
because they're looking for Matt.

110
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,042
Once they have him...

111
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,962
But he can't. He'll never agree to it.

112
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,421
There's no reason to think the FBI

113
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,009
knows anything about Matt's other life.

114
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,346
But if he can give 'em that
witness, Matt's in the clear.

115
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,848
So we all are.

116
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,019
I could reach out as Matt's
attorney and negotiate his surrender.

117
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,859
Okay, but I'm not ready to forgive him.

118
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,445
I get it.

119
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,741
You know, you shouldn't be either.

120
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,077
I mean, he... he stole your
identity, he made you a target.

121
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,706
Has Matt been a shitty friend
lately? Without a doubt.

122
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,044
But, deep down, I think it's hurting
him as much as it's hurting us.

123
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,379
How do you figure?

124
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:58,134
Because he could've gone to any
reporter, Karen, but he came to you.

125
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,679
Maybe Matt's finally
coming to his senses.

126
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:06,434
But even if he isn't, the way he's
been treating us lately is on him.

127
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,188
Us turning our backs would be on us.

128
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,835
People have bailed on
Matt his whole life,

129
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:16,486
and I'm not gonna be one of 'em.

130
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,322
You do what you want, but...

131
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,991
that's not the kind
of friend I wanna be.

132
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,582
It's like you argue for
a living or something.

133
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,878
Was it too much? It felt like too much.

134
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,175
Matt said he was staying at
the place where he grew up.

135
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,261
Do you know where that is?

136
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,946
Don't you look pretty today.

137
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,407
You know you're two hours early, right?

138
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:07,370
- Yeah, the, uh, the neighbors kept me up.
- Again?

139
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,498
Shit. You gotta move. Or get
them into couples therapy.

140
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,666
If those were my neighbors,

141
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,749
I'd go over there and give
them a piece of my mind.

142
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,353
Do you think a killer like
that deserves a second chance?

143
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,173
Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.

144
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,010
It just works better with
a North Star to guide you.

145
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,013
Let go of me, Dex. I said let go!

146
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,973
Then you'll rely on our structure.

147
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,559
A tidy physical space. A disciplined...

148
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,269
Do you wanna hang out after?

149
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,566
- Yeah.
- Where'd you go?

150
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,900
It's feeding time.

151
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,987
You know, I, uh... I got it.

152
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,906
You sure? You're not
even on the clock yet.

153
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,492
Yeah, I could use a
decent cup of coffee.

154
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,870
You mind going downstairs
and grabbing me one?

155
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,371
And I'll feed the animal.

156
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,998
He's all yours.

157
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,460
I don't know what strings you had
to pull to get that waitress a job,

158
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,170
but it was a waste of your time.

159
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,341
Yeah, they train us in
counterintel at Quantico.

160
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,968
You really think I'm gonna fall
for some bush-league honey trap?

161
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,640
You got it in your head that
she means something to me.

162
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,683
But she doesn't.

163
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,104
She doesn't mean shit to me.

164
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,610
So what? You...

165
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,613
You have me tailed for a few
days, you think you know me?

166
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,115
Think you got me dialed?

167
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,243
You don't, all right?

168
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,453
You don't know anything about me.

169
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,749
Say something!

170
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,341
When I was a boy...

171
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,510
I...

172
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,515
beat my father's skull in with a hammer.

173
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,393
I was 12 years old.

174
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,316
Young for my age, in fact.
Terribly inexperienced.

175
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,902
I'd never been to a
dance with a girl or...

176
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,530
stayed up past midnight.

177
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:53,077
Never been out of the city or
even taken the subway on my own.

178
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,038
Yet there I was...

179
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,875
twelve years old...

180
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,211
standing over my father's body...

181
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,549
watching him die by my hand.

182
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,764
That feeling.

183
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,892
That moment.

184
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,609
I sense it's something
you're familiar with.

185
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,694
You...

186
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:33,826
were taught to hide
beneath many fictions.

187
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,913
You fashioned yourself

188
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,542
into something the world would tolerate.

189
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,589
A soldier doing his patriotic
duty. A sniper in the FBI.

190
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,052
The watchful companion
of a nice young woman.

191
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,012
You destroyed what we had.

192
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:58,309
If it were honest and true,
no one could've destroyed it.

193
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,520
I should've let you die.

194
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,065
Stay back.

195
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,817
Julie never would've understood you.

196
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,364
And society won't either.

197
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,245
It punishes people like you.

198
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,624
Like us.

199
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,893
Julie never would've
understood you. The real you.

200
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,020
She never would've
understood the real you.

201
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,231
And society won't either.

202
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:49,151
- It punishes people like you. Like us.
- It's all over the papers. Dex?

203
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,612
Dex? Dex!

204
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,322
What?

205
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,912
They're throwing you under the bus.

206
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,418
I'm sorry, Dex.

207
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,962
It isn't right.

208
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,235
Sister Maggie?

209
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,112
Can I help you?

210
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,617
Uh, yes. Uh, one of the nuns
said I should speak with you.

211
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,493
Um...

212
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:45,166
I'm looking for Matt Murdock.

213
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,628
I'm sure he swore you to secrecy, but...

214
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,213
he came to see me this morning.

215
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,758
Asked for my help.

216
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,636
Uh, is he here?

217
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,016
No, he's not.

218
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,146
Okay. I'm sorry. Sorry to bother you.

219
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,903
"And some bloody their fists
trying to keep the Kitchen safe."

220
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,909
I wrote that.

221
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,745
It was in your piece about Daredevil.

222
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,500
He's a complicated man.

223
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,963
Yes. Yes, he is.

224
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,300
I've read several of your
articles the past few days.

225
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,012
- I've been trying to find some insight.
- Mmm.

226
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,181
Did you find any?

227
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,726
'Cause I sure as hell didn't.

228
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,354
Oh, I'm... sorry.

229
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,732
Wears you out, doesn't it?

230
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,360
Saving him from himself.

231
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,699
Yeah. I don't think I can do it anymore.

232
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,160
I think I'm done.

233
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,456
Matt was a tough one when he was a kid.

234
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,044
He held the record for the most
Hail Marys, five years running.

235
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,129
Hmm.

236
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,757
I wonder how many he'd
have to say these days.

237
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,721
He came to us right
after he lost his father.

238
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,180
His only family.

239
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,933
He was alone in the world.

240
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,644
In his private darkness.

241
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,980
Surrounded by strangers.

242
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,858
Yet he seemed fine during the day.

243
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,653
He'd eat with the others...

244
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,198
attend his classes, go to mass.

245
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,956
But he was plagued by awful nightmares.

246
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,296
He'd wake in a sweat, screaming.

247
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:01,010
He didn't say what they were
about. He'd just call out for help.

248
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:06,307
So I'd go, and I'd hold his
hand till he fell back asleep.

249
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,023
But I have so many
children under my care.

250
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,611
Matthew wasn't the only one.

251
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,073
His nightmares went on for months.

252
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,788
One night, Matthew called
for help and I didn't answer.

253
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,832
I didn't go to him.

254
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,003
He never asked us for anything again.

255
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,507
He shut us out. Shut everyone out.

256
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,178
Everyone in Matthew's
life abandoned him.

257
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,597
Including me.

258
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:03,364
When someone in need
tries to push you away...

259
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,576
you have to find the
strength to hold on tighter.

260
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,758
Seems unfair. It's an optics thing.

261
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,678
I can assure you,

262
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,181
there'll be an immediate
investigation into how this leaked.

263
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,141
Think of it as a paid vacation.

264
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,811
Take a minute, if you
need, to pack things up.

265
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,773
We prepared for this.

266
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,317
You are gonna get a job...

267
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,152
with a nice, rigid structure.

268
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,863
You're gonna stick to your meds.

269
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,322
Learn to stay calm.

270
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,762
You got a minute?

271
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,098
Yeah. Sure, Dex.

272
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,602
Hey, give us a sec?

273
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,437
They're...

274
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,608
They're puttin' me on leave,
Ray. They're... They're, uh...

275
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,653
Hey, first thing you have to
do is take a breath, all right?

276
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,864
Everything's gonna be okay.

277
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,950
Then look me in the
eyes when you say that.

278
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,704
Hey, I'm on your side here.

279
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,166
I can't get shut out, man.

280
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,335
I need this job.

281
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,296
Please. There's gotta
be something you can do.

282
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,508
I made a point to commend your
conduct in my shooting report.

283
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,135
You see how alone you are?

284
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,596
It wasn't your fault.

285
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,058
Dex, tell me... What's
making you scared?

286
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,518
It's just you surrounded
by all this emptiness.

287
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,563
- You see how alone you are?
- You got nothing to worry about.

288
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,891
You lost?

289
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,602
Not if you're holding.

290
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,687
You a cop?

291
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,870
Doesn't matter what I am.

292
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,482
I'm just looking for
a couple of teeners.

293
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,321
That'll be $80.

294
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,494
And a crash.

295
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,115
So we take here the paprika.

296
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,286
And it's a smoked paprika.
We put it on the plate.

297
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,873
And I will be adding to
it tomatoes and a bit of...

298
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,442
Hey.

299
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,403
Hey, uh...

300
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,909
you point me towards, uh,
Jasper Evans, this is yours.

301
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,995
What the hell's it to you?

302
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,837
Everybody out.

303
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,257
Get out!

304
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,220
Jasper Evans?

305
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,613
Sit down.

306
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,706
You okay?

307
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,711
Okay.

308
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,921
So you knew his last known address?

309
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,757
You knew he'd probably
be here, so what...

310
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,802
what were you waiting for?

311
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,096
For me?

312
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,309
You knew I'd come?

313
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,562
I hoped.

314
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,983
Okay, look, I'm gonna help you.

315
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,067
But...

316
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,029
after that, I need you
to help Foggy and me.

317
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,698
Look, the FBI are all over us...

318
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,408
You want me to turn myself in.

319
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,996
- Did you talk to Foggy?
- No. But, uh...

320
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,207
it's the smart move.

321
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,501
Sure, I'll do it.

322
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,380
But what if they figured
out that you're... you?

323
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,842
Well, this mask doesn't do me any
good if I'm a wanted man, either way.

324
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,012
Besides, if the FBI
figured out who I am,

325
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,450
who knows, maybe I'll get lucky
and they'll lock me up next to Fisk.

326
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,144
Jesus.

327
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,190
Foggy said you were... different.

328
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,652
Changed, I guess. I
told him it was bullshit.

329
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,737
All right, look, we can't
take his statement here.

330
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,822
Fisk's lawyers will say it was coerced.

331
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,992
Yeah, no, we take him to the Bulletin.

332
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,036
We get him on record
in front of witnesses.

333
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,538
Besides, my editor's gonna wanna
hear this with his own ears.

334
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,873
Wake up, Evans.

335
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
It's your lucky day. I'm
gonna give you a choice.

336
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,838
Option one: I call the FBI...

337
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,966
and Wilson Fisk has you killed

338
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,009
before you can tell 'em
how you got out of prison.

339
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,555
Option two: you tell this nice reporter

340
00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:24,346
the truth about what you did for Fisk

341
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,629
and I'll let you run someplace
Fisk will never find you.

342
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,642
- I can't.
- Cool. Option one.

343
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,394
No, if I talk, Fisk kills my son!

344
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,231
Look at this place.

345
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,608
I grew up here.

346
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,877
We had a good life before
the neighborhood went down

347
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,530
and I got myself put away.

348
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:45,200
I left my son without a father. And
this is what he does with his life.

349
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,703
If I go back inside,

350
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,248
it won't be long until he's
sharin' a cell with me or worse.

351
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,297
If Fisk stays out of prison,

352
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,174
a lot of innocent people are gonna die.

353
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,607
So you can either
tell my paper the truth

354
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:06,013
and we let you and your son run far away

355
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,931
or you can go back to prison

356
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,775
and I print the story
like you talked anyway.

357
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,061
You would lie and get us both killed?

358
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,605
Your choice.

359
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,158
Special Agent Nadeem.

360
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,702
Mr. Nelson.

361
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,247
I'm glad to see you've reconsidered.

362
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,376
The sandwich you ordered last night.

363
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,882
I'm here to represent Matt
Murdock, as his attorney.

364
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,470
So when I asked if you
knew where Murdock was...

365
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,014
I didn't lie. Matt contacted me today.

366
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,391
My client's ready to
submit to questioning.

367
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,477
That's fantastic.

368
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,395
So, uh...

369
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,606
where is he?

370
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,608
I'll provide him to you tonight.

371
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,486
After you hear the
statement of a second witness

372
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,654
who will convince you
of my client's innocence.

373
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,782
It sounds like I'm being
jerked around, counselor.

374
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,826
His name is Jasper Evans.

375
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,496
And you're really gonna
wanna hear what he has to say.

376
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,431
Hallelujah.

377
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,185
So you can dress like
a normal human being.

378
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,479
Clean socks.

379
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,606
Thank you.

380
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,691
Well, it warms my heart

381
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:45,445
to see you going out to do
something other than beat someone up.

382
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,282
How do you know?

383
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,702
Could just be adding
style to my beatings.

384
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,788
Did you...

385
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,207
Did you just make a joke?

386
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,254
You look ready to smile, which
I'm sure in your case means...

387
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,494
Well, I don't know what that could mean,

388
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:07,384
as I've never actually seen one.

389
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,472
This have something to do with the
blond who came to visit me today?

390
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,225
Karen.

391
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,605
Yeah. Yeah, I'm meeting her.

392
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,690
Wow.

393
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,067
She's lovely.

394
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,736
She is.

395
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,573
She knows you're Daredevil.

396
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,741
She does.

397
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,285
And she stuck around?

398
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,246
Sounds like a keeper.

399
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,540
We're just friends.

400
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,127
Well, it's nice to
hear you use the F-word.

401
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:48,175
And to see you reconnecting.

402
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,342
Wait, I'm...

403
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,514
She's just helping me one last time.

404
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,933
It's not a criticism, Matthew.

405
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,227
Calling you an idiot...

406
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,315
for believing that friends make
you weaker rather than stronger?

407
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,983
That would be a criticism.

408
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,569
Thank you for clarifying that.

409
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,072
Anyway, where are you off to?

410
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,367
Gotta turn myself in to the FBI.

411
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,785
You must be joking.

412
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,662
You need a suit for that?

413
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,915
I've been falsely accused.

414
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,000
Gotta clear my name.

415
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,794
You mean Matt Murdock's name.

416
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,297
If you're leaving him
behind, why does it matter?

417
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,468
My life is complicated enough
without being a wanted fugitive.

418
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,557
And there are... other people involved.

419
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,725
Other people?

420
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,478
You mean your friends?

421
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,995
So you've heard? Congratulations, Ray.

422
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,498
- What?
- You were right.

423
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,917
Your work with Fisk
trumped your credit issues.

424
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,002
The EAD approved your promotion.

425
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,214
Wow, I, uh...

426
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,342
- Wow.
- That's not why you're here?

427
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,643
Murdock's lawyer just promised
to surrender him tonight.

428
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,354
That's great.

429
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,984
But only after we hear from a witness
he claims can exonerate Murdock

430
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,236
and prove that Fisk has been playing us.

431
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:33,989
He's bullshitting.

432
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,950
Yeah, well, he claims his
witness is Jasper Evans.

433
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,368
Why do I know that name?

434
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,954
He's the guy that shanked Fisk.

435
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,540
That proves Murdock's
attorney is bullshitting.

436
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,084
Evans isn't giving any
statements. He's in the hole.

437
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,419
Actually, he's not.

438
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,589
I just got off the
phone with the warden.

439
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:51,923
Evans is missing.

440
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,842
What do you mean he's missing?

441
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,928
I mean, they've searched the prison
top to bottom and he's not there.

442
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,930
Jesus.

443
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,351
If Murdock's attorney has him...

444
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,897
you don't think he's right
about what Evans can prove?

445
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,650
How can he be?

446
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,654
Fisk's intel checks out,
and we're watching him 24/7.

447
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,907
- We'd know if he was playing us.
- Right.

448
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,118
So it's a bluff.

449
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,497
It's a bluff.

450
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,488
Suicide Prevention, this is Julie...

451
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,743
Tell me, Dex, are you thinking
about taking your own life right now?

452
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,286
How are you going to do it, Dex?

453
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,164
Do you have a gun?

454
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,457
Learn to stay calm.

455
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,001
- Is it in your hand?
- It wasn't your fault.

456
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,045
The world doesn't want you.

457
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,130
I don't want you.

458
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,508
It wasn't your fault.

459
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,134
Learn to stay calm.

460
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,970
Do you have a gun? You
know where to press it.

461
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,681
You see how alone you are?

462
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,391
You know where to press it.

463
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:46,705
Hello?

464
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,960
When I was in prison,
my mother passed away.

465
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:57,674
Among her effects was a
shoebox with my name on it.

466
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,052
A keepsake box of sorts.

467
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:05,557
It was full of happy
relics from my life.

468
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,269
The gifts that I made
her when I was young.

469
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,105
The odd news clipping.

470
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,023
And the hammer.

471
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,193
The instrument of my father's death.

472
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,654
I thought that she had thrown it away.

473
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,536
But she was proud of what
I had done, of who I was.

474
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,543
She accepted me, without shame.

475
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,795
And that's what I want for you.

476
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,174
Someone to accept you, without shame.

477
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,259
I do.

478
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:47,307
And I've sent you a gift, an
opportunity to become your true self.

479
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,642
And if you accept this...

480
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:55,482
unlike everyone in your life,
I will never abandon you.

481
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,318
The decision is yours.

482
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,730
A car is waiting, sir, if
you care to come with me.

483
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,233
I wanted to put some money in it,

484
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:13,726
but I'm a little bit behind on my rent.

485
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,481
Are you sure you wanna do this?

486
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,609
You confident this FBI
agent can be trusted?

487
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,240
Nadeem's a ball breaker,

488
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:25,697
but he seems genuinely
interested in the truth.

489
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,449
Yeah. I trust him.

490
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,621
Then, yeah, I'm sure.

491
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,177
So, I got your message.

492
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,221
Why am I missing my wife's office party?

493
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,474
This is Jasper Evans.
He's here to go on record.

494
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,519
He's the inmate who shanked
Wilson Fisk in prison.

495
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,730
Fisk made me do it.

496
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,482
We just got the call.
Murdock's at the Bulletin.

497
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,609
What about Jasper Evans?

498
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,693
Nelson didn't say,

499
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,934
but doing this at the newspaper means

500
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,905
they want it as public as possible.

501
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,908
Get Murdock and find out
what the hell is going on.

502
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,452
The publisher and the
lawyers want it all on tape.

503
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,996
Just tell the truth,
you'll be outta here soon.

504
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,082
Just, uh, give me a minute.

505
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,317
- I know you told me lay off Fisk, but...
- All right, look...

506
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,261
- We owe this to Ben.
- Stop, stop, stop.

507
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,721
I owe you... an apology.

508
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,933
Someone has gotta shine a light on this.

509
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,371
And, well, I'm grateful

510
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:39,938
that you were brave enough
to make me do it, so...

511
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,690
thank you.

512
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,069
Lead on.

513
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,579
What is it?

514
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,458
Do you hear something?

515
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,126
Screaming.

516
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:05,911
Please state your name.

517
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,341
- My name is Jasper Evans.
- Good.

518
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,928
Now, can you tell us
how you know Wilson Fisk?

519
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,682
What the hell's going on?

520
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,917
Foggy, find Karen. Get her outta here.

521
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,776
Oh, shit. This is not happening.

522
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,405
Great, another power outage.

523
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,608
Genny's kicked in. At
least our work is saved.

524
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,885
Probably another fire
drill no one told us about.

525
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,036
That's weird. The phones are out, too.

526
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,496
Hey, you can't be here!

527
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,768
Karen? What is it?

528
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,104
What's wrong?

529
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,397
- We prepared for this.
- Let go of me, Dex.

530
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,334
I said let go!

531
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:29,756
Fashioned yourself into
something the world will tolerate!

532
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,174
It's just you.

533
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,635
People like you. Like us.

534
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,764
The real you.

535
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,788
- Karen!
- Jesus.

536
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,625
Who are you?

537
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,711
I'm Daredevil.

538
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,215
Stop or I'll...

539
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,299
Ahh!

540
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,597
The hell are you do...

541
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,749
Hello, Karen. It's
nice to see you again.

542
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,143
Did anyone see what happened?

543
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,190
Check 'em. You two, with me!

544
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,332
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Matt?

545
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,293
Jesus Christ.

546
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,052
Foggy?

547
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,763
No, no, no. He's okay. He's okay.

548
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,474
Jesus, are you?

549
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,728
Did he kill Jasper?

550
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,315
Yeah.

551
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,736
Yeah.

552
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,281
I don't, uh...

553
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,134
FBI, don't move!

554
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,826
Agents down! Agents down!

555
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:01,957
FBI, nobody move!

556
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,572
What the hell happened?

557
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:58,824
Who did this?

558
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,750
It was Daredevil.
