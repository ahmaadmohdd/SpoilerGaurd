2
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,365
After the attack at the Bulletin

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,611
and the horrible tragedy
at the Clinton Church,

4
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,560
what will it take before people realize

5
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:31,698
that Wilson Fisk was
set up by Daredevil?

6
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,217
People are beginning to realize

7
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:35,369
Fisk was the victim of a smear campaign.

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,871
Daredevil was the one behind it all.

9
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,416
And what about Daredevil's apologists
like Blake Tower and Karen Page?

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,728
- She should be in jail.
- We have breaking news

11
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:47,130
that Fisk has invited many of
New York's most powerful figures

12
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,717
to the Presidential Hotel for
some kind of surprise announcement.

13
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:51,801
Oh.

14
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,145
Kidnapping me will get you nothing.

15
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,273
- What is Fisk planning?
- Planning?

16
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,734
I scouted his hotel. Extra security.

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,904
Preparations for some
big event. What is it?

18
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,365
What Fisk will do to me
is infinitely worse...

19
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,495
Things are about to
get very bad for you.

20
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:23,458
What is Fisk planning?

21
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,918
Do you mind if I come in?

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,927
Marriage?

23
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,721
He's been planning the
ceremony for months.

24
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,316
He's gonna charm the
press and the public

25
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:41,060
and make Hell's Kitchen love him again.

26
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,565
- Do I look that nervous?
- Yes, a little, but it's charming.

27
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:00,704
I never knew that I could feel
this way until the day that we met.

28
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,458
I didn't think that I was capable,

29
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,835
that there would be someone...

30
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,882
that I would care for
more than my own life.

31
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,554
That her happiness would be more
important than anything else.

32
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,264
And then...

33
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,299
a terrifying thought occurred to me

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,774
that perhaps my feelings were a trick.

35
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,444
The self-deception of a vain man.

36
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,531
That the only reason why I love you

37
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,576
is because of the way I see
my reflection in your eyes.

38
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,122
That thought, it fills me with dread.

39
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,751
The fear that...

40
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,672
that I don't deserve you...

41
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,800
and that I am broken.

42
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,680
Don't you understand we're all broken?

43
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:05,477
The point is to find the person
whose broken pieces fit with yours.

44
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,772
You're gonna tell me everything.

45
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,067
I wanna know where everyone is gonna be.

46
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,070
Anyone who could stop me.

47
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,612
Stop you?

48
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,240
From killing Fisk.

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,744
He controls all of the FBI
agents who are guarding him.

50
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,204
The hotel is a fortress.

51
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,288
Is that a no?

52
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,083
- You'll never get to him.
- Sounds like a no.

53
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,512
I can give you something better!

54
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,806
I'm listening.

55
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:48,687
I witnessed Ms. Marianna order
the murder of Agent Nadeem.

56
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,941
And Fisk ordered many.

57
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,028
Agent Winn. Julie Barnes!

58
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,114
I could testify!

59
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,533
I know about Winn and Nadeem.

60
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,161
Who's Julie Barnes?

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,167
The rose.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,170
I think.

63
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,219
Tell me again how you ended
up dangling off a building?

64
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,012
I tripped.

65
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,431
Get him out of here.

66
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,900
I thought "ambulance chaser"
was a figure of speech.

67
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,403
Not one of your best burns, Detective.

68
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,530
I'm not in the mood to be clever today.

69
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,156
Yeah, me neither.

70
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,242
We had him, Foggy.

71
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,203
We were this goddamn close.

72
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,745
I know.

73
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,584
Instead of locking up that bald asshole,

74
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,378
I had to tell Mrs. Nadeem she'd
never see her husband again.

75
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,504
How did that happen?

76
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,631
I don't know.

77
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,010
Listen.

78
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,929
Something's been
brought to my attention.

79
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,225
As an officer of the court,
I'm compelled to report it.

80
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,270
I have reason to believe

81
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,189
that someone's gonna try
to murder Wilson Fisk today.

82
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,274
Someone, huh?

83
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,194
About what time is this going down?
I wanna have some popcorn ready.

84
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,655
Need I remind you of your
obligation to protect and serve?

85
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,824
Stick your obligation
up your ass, Nelson.

86
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,953
If Fisk disappears, all
his bullshit goes with him.

87
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:56,124
And the FBI agents on his payroll
just fold back into the mix.

88
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,044
Including the one who shot Ray.

89
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,339
Don't think of it as protecting Fisk.

90
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,591
Think of it as protecting
the case we can build

91
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,593
against the shitbags who helped him.

92
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,304
Once we get them, they'll
turn faster than old milk.

93
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,016
Still, with Fisk gone,
we'll get 'em eventually.

94
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,186
Brett, please.

95
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,272
This certain someone
we're talking about...

96
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,317
he's angry.

97
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,405
But I know he'll do the right
thing if I can just slow him down.

98
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,574
Give him time to think.

99
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,955
I'll beef up the
perimeter around the hotel.

100
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,625
- But I'm sending in my C team.
- Thank you.

101
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,752
I'm talking rookies and retirees.

102
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,466
After the body of
Supervisory Special Agent Winn

103
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,968
was found in the Hudson,

104
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,054
search divers also
recovered the murder weapon.

105
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,976
The registered service sidearm
of fellow FBI agent Ray Nadeem.

106
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,521
When agents went to
take Nadeem into custody,

107
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,606
he drew a weapon to resist arrest

108
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,818
and forced his fellow agents
to kill him in self-defense.

109
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,946
Sadly, we may never know what
kind of mental instability

110
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,157
drove Ray Nadeem to
commit this senseless act.

111
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,578
But our thoughts and prayers go out
to the families of all the agents

112
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,497
who have been impacted by these events.

113
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,584
Press is calling me a liar. FBI
is calling Ray mentally unstable.

114
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,505
Ray's grand jury testimony is sealed,

115
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,941
so Fisk is just throwing up smokescreens

116
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,884
until people forget and move on.

117
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,968
Yeah?

118
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,428
Well, unless Matt figures
out some way to stop him,

119
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,974
he's going to get away
with it. With all of it.

120
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,892
You mean unless Matt kills him.

121
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,604
Shouldn't have warned Mahoney.

122
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,649
If the police have Fisk surrounded,

123
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,693
maybe Matt won't be able
to go through with it.

124
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,405
- Or maybe he'll get arrested. Or worse.
- Karen...

125
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,658
Look, I'm not saying that I want
him to kill Fisk. I don't want that.

126
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,996
What if it's the only way?

127
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,666
It's, uh... It's not murder
if it's self-defense, right?

128
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,423
Technically, plotting to kill someone

129
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:05,795
is the exact legal
opposite of self-defense.

130
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,255
You know what I mean.

131
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,592
I get it.

132
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,763
Our best shot at taking
down Fisk died with Nadeem.

133
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,558
But yesterday was also a good day...

134
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,352
... because Matt came back to us.

135
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,104
The real Matt.

136
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,814
Yeah, for, like, a minute maybe.

137
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,275
Eventually, he'll come to his senses.

138
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,941
Matt's Matt because he believes that

139
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:31,237
everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

140
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,489
Except Fisk.

141
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,700
Everyone. It's a Catholic thing.

142
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,535
That's why he doesn't kill people.

143
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,746
If he crosses that line...

144
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,625
Matt will never be
able to forgive himself.

145
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,582
And being around us will just remind him

146
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,254
of who he was and what he's done.

147
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,801
- Yeah, we'd really lose him, wouldn't we?
- Forever, this time.

148
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,188
Hello?

149
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,818
Yes.

150
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,320
Can I ask why?

151
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,949
Uh, no need. I know where you are.

152
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,368
What? What is it?

153
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,330
The FBI wants me to come in.

154
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,209
It's Fisk.

155
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,712
- Yeah. It might be.
- Might be?

156
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,632
Foggy, you're not going down there.

157
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,886
I have a life.

158
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,306
I'm not prepared to
become a wanted fugitive.

159
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,850
Wait, wait, wait. No, just wait.

160
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,645
What if it's a trap and you
don't walk out again? Huh?

161
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,483
Can you run that downstairs?

162
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,116
Mr. Nelson.

163
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,326
Special Agent Poindexter.

164
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,912
You just won me 50 bucks.

165
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,331
Some of the guys were
betting you wouldn't show.

166
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,501
I'm always available to help
the FBI, Agent Poindexter.

167
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,295
In fact...

168
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,798
please smile.

169
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,720
There.

170
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,097
Posted to my campaign web page

171
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,018
and the tens of thousands of police
officers that know that I'm here.

172
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,228
With you. Helping.

173
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,565
Relax, Mr. Nelson.
You're not in any danger.

174
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,193
You'll be very useful when
you're the next district attorney.

175
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,321
Why am I here?

176
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,450
- 'Cause Ray Nadeem was a friend of yours.
- A client.

177
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,411
Sad, the way it all turned out.

178
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:44,995
Even though he's dead,

179
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,749
I can't answer any questions
that would violate privilege.

180
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,125
I'm not asking you to.

181
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,044
Follow me.

182
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,804
Thank you for coming, Mr. Nelson.

183
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,936
Mrs. Nadeem. What are you doing here?

184
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,521
I came to apologize.

185
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,358
To apologize?

186
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,736
I asked them to call you,
because you were Ray's lawyer.

187
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,615
And I want to fully cooperate with
the investigation of my husband.

188
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,117
What Ray did is...

189
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,121
How could a man I loved
with all my heart...

190
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,335
the father of my son, turn
out to be such a monster?

191
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,462
It wasn't your fault, Seema.

192
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,422
Ray fooled a lot of people.

193
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,925
Nobody here blames you or Sami.

194
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,552
You're still part of the FBI family.

195
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,348
We'll give you the room.
Take all the time you need.

196
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,191
Suck it up.

197
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,277
I'm only doing this because I have to.

198
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,365
- How's Sami?
- He's okay.

199
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,033
With my sister.

200
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,327
I haven't told him yet.

201
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,748
- When did you get here?
- I came as soon as I saw the news.

202
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,921
I didn't want to believe it, but
I know I needed to hear the truth.

203
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,470
I'm so sorry. That...

204
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,181
must have been an incredible shock.

205
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,266
It was.

206
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,513
But I decided it was
the right thing for me

207
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,897
to come in and to cooperate.

208
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,191
That was smart.

209
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,485
Totally the right thing to do.

210
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:46,743
I was hoping you could help me
figure out how I can help the FBI.

211
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,747
And whether or not Ray's life
insurance policy will still pay.

212
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,166
Otherwise, Sami and I
have nothing to live on.

213
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,917
How will we survive?

214
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,471
I'll help you figure
it out, Mrs. Nadeem.

215
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,808
Whatever I can do to help
you and Sami get through this.

216
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,115
What do you want?

217
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,494
I'm coming for you, Dex. And my suit.

218
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,746
Where's Felix?

219
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,664
You'll find out soon enough.

220
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,459
I've got some free time
now. Why don't we meet up?

221
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,627
I have a question.

222
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,756
Did you enjoy the feeling you
got when you killed those birdies?

223
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,217
Is that why you're still killing?

224
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,510
Birdies?

225
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,178
The ones you killed with rocks.

226
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,931
I bet it felt good at first, right?

227
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,934
Then it's never the same after that.

228
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,355
What do you think Dr. Mercer
would say if she could see you now?

229
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,940
Can you hang on a second?

230
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:03,027
I need a tissue for all the tears
I'm crying over my shitty childhood.

231
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,614
Have you heard from
your friend Julie lately?

232
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,492
You wanna talk to Dr.
Mercer, asshole? Keep talking.

233
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,709
What do you think she'd say if she knew

234
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,615
about the innocent people you killed?

235
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,748
I bet she'd be disappointed, Dex.

236
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,876
If she were still alive.

237
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,294
If you...

238
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,132
If you hurt Julie...

239
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,843
Fisk had her killed.

240
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,598
He killed Julie, so he could
replace her as your North Star.

241
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,563
You should stick to
beating on people in alleys,

242
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,274
because you're not
going to get in my head.

243
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,900
You don't have to believe me.

244
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,945
Then again, you may wanna
ask how I got Manning's phone.

245
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,363
Don't know. Don't care.

246
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,324
Julie wouldn't approve of
you killing people, Dex.

247
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,077
Stop saying her name.

248
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,079
You said you got some free time?

249
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,833
You may wanna check out 16 Canal Place.

250
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,375
Why?

251
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:10,136
If you're showing this to Sami,
I need you to stop the video now.

252
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,807
For everyone else...

253
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,186
My name is Special Agent
Ray Nadeem of the FBI,

254
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,520
and under federal law,

255
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:23,191
I swear that the testimony
I'm about to give is the truth,

256
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,110
whole truth and nothing but the truth...

257
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,113
and should be considered
my dying declaration.

258
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,450
I'm guilty of a number of criminal acts,

259
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,702
and I was in no way acting alone.

260
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:40,333
Wilson Fisk coerced me and
a number of fellow FBI agents

261
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,169
into aiding and abetting
a criminal conspiracy...

262
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,256
to extort protection money from
New York crime organizations.

263
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,926
I gotta hand it to you, Fisk.
You know how to put on a show.

264
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,534
Agents Arinori, Johnson, Markham,

265
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:56,265
Mockter, O'Connor and
Ramsey all took part

266
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,684
and continue to act as Fisk's operatives

267
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:03,856
under the orders of our boss,
Special Agent in Charge Tammy Hattley.

268
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,568
There may be others. I can't be sure.

269
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,695
But I personally witnessed

270
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,659
SAC Hattley murder Agent Winn
in her kitchen, using my handgun.

271
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,786
No!

272
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,331
And then witnessed Fisk's
aide, Felix Manning,

273
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,961
remove the body and use this
crime and threats against my family

274
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,672
to blackmail me into
cooperating with Fisk.

275
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,007
I'm not making any excuses,

276
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:33,636
because I aided and abetted
the worst crime of them all.

277
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,849
I personally drove Special
Agent Ben Poindexter

278
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:43,354
to the Clinton Church...
dressed in a fake Daredevil suit.

279
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,024
I knew at this point

280
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,111
that Poindexter was the killer
who attacked the Bulletin,

281
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,155
and I knew he was going to do
something horrible at the church.

282
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,032
But I let it happen anyway.

283
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:04,333
So I'm guilty of aiding and abetting
the murder of Father Paul Lantom.

284
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,128
I'm ashamed of what I've done.

285
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,006
But that doesn't change the fact that I

286
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,593
and everyone I just
named are guilty as hell.

287
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,386
Seems...

288
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,474
you need to get this
video to my attorneys.

289
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,351
And don't try and run.

290
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,205
Go to the FBI and pretend

291
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,273
like you don't know
anything about any of this.

292
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,775
Tell them I'm a monster.

293
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,113
It's the only way that you
and Sami can get through this.

294
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,866
I'm sorry, baby.

295
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,452
I will always love you.

296
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,918
God.

297
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,506
He knew he was gonna die.

298
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,011
Okay, so... maybe it
won't hold up in court.

299
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,734
But if we put this out there, it'll
make Fisk's life a living hell.

300
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:05,186
Actually, a dying declaration
is exempt from the hearsay rule.

301
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,354
What?

302
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,899
The court says that a person who
believes that they're dying is...

303
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,567
has less incentive to lie.

304
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,110
Therefore, anything they say is...

305
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,196
You're telling me this
is admissible in court?

306
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,989
Every damn word.

307
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,908
It's the silver bullet
to take down Fisk.

308
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,160
Shit. The world has to know.

309
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,204
The world and Matt.

310
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,295
When I find you...

311
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,255
Like I said,

312
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,841
Fisk killed her and we both know it.

313
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,968
- You did this.
- Think, Dex.

314
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,888
Who got Julie the job in the hotel?

315
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,477
Who had you followed when
you were stalking her?

316
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,476
It was all Fisk.

317
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,896
You let him turn you into a murderer.

318
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,023
You think he's gonna
let Julie get in the way?

319
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,652
Why are you telling me this?

320
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,905
'Cause Fisk wants to
get married tonight.

321
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,992
And I don't think he deserves
a life of happily ever after.

322
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,323
Wonder what the bride's gonna wear.

323
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,479
Ladies and gentlemen,

324
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,634
please have your invitations in hand

325
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:39,567
as you go through the metal detector.

326
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,361
Who does Fisk think he is?

327
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,698
Summoning us here with no notice.

328
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,409
Well, he's the only one who can.

329
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,036
Well, he's really
starting to piss me off.

330
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,122
Oh, relax. Here, have some champagne.

331
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,416
You'll live longer.

332
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,920
- This is what we're running?
- Mmm-hmm.

333
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,720
Well, it's official. Yesterday sucked.

334
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,097
Yes, it did.

335
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,058
But today is gonna make it all worth it.

336
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,685
- What's this?
- Look.

337
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,900
My name is Special Agent
Ray Nadeem of the FBI,

338
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,902
and under federal law,

339
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,613
I swear that the testimony
I'm about to give...

340
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,793
Parking's on 53rd. We're
staging the motorcade... Jesus.

341
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,003
Hey there, Lim.

342
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,339
Dex?

343
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,094
That's Agent Lim. He's
one of the good ones.

344
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,513
- What in the hell...
- Do yourself a favor.

345
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,516
Walk away.

346
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,316
... to be a loving and faithful husband,

347
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,319
in plenty and in want,
in joy and in sorrow,

348
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:09,365
in sickness and in health, as
long as you both shall live?

349
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,994
Wilson?

350
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,872
Wilson?

351
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,624
I...

352
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,419
Repeat the question.

353
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,631
Do you?

354
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,093
I do.

355
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,179
- And you?
- I do.

356
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,723
Then you may.

357
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,694
... we are so glad you could come

358
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:09,174
and celebrate with us tonight.

359
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:13,387
It is my honor and privilege to
present to you for the first time...

360
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,057
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson Fisk.

361
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,649
- Hi.
- Beautiful ceremony, Vanessa.

362
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,942
Thank you for coming.

363
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:32,865
That was a bold move

364
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,743
to sit me next to the prosecutor
who tried to send me away.

365
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,162
I told him to hold my purse.

366
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,591
That must have been
very satisfying for you.

367
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,667
It was. My tax dollars at work.

368
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,836
You never disappoint.

369
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,058
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

370
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,695
we'd like to invite the bride and groom

371
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:52,384
to the floor for the first dance.

372
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,719
I believe that's our cue.

373
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,264
My name is Special Agent
Ray Nadeem of the FBI,

374
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,183
and under federal law,

375
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,394
I swear that the testimony
I'm about to give...

376
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,563
Everyone's looking at us.

377
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,193
They're staring.

378
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,920
... of criminal acts,

379
00:26:54,921 --> 00:26:57,783
and I was in no way acting alone.

380
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,119
Wilson Fisk coerced me...

381
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,165
My name is Special Agent
Ray Nadeem of the FBI...

382
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,250
What's happening?

383
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,753
... to extort protection money
from New York crime organizations.

384
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,713
Agents Arinori...

385
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,150
Ladies and gentlemen,
this next one's a favorite,

386
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,844
so grab your dance partner
and head to the floor.

387
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,014
You'll handle it, Wilson.

388
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:25,185
Like you handle everything. Show
them that none of it matters.

389
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,695
Agents down. Repeat, agents down.

390
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,239
Daredevil is en route to the ballroom.

391
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,663
Sir, there's trouble. Agents are down.

392
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,666
We're under attack.

393
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,271
I'd like to make a toast.

394
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,046
It's Daredevil.

395
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:57,217
Julie and I wish you the absolute best.

396
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,866
Hold your fire!

397
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,914
- How did this happen?
- Dex knows our security protocols.

398
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,543
That video of Agent
Nadeem is a threat to us.

399
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,922
I'll discredit his testimony
and take care of everything.

400
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,215
- I will handle it.
- Wilson.

401
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,467
I should have never let
Dex get that close to you.

402
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,469
Be angry later. Be smart now.

403
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,054
Listen to me.

404
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,351
We need to run.

405
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,563
You didn't make a mistake marrying me.

406
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,107
I know that. But now, be smart.

407
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,068
For both of us.

408
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,472
Please don't.

409
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,569
Reports of Daredevil attacking
the hotel continue to circulate.

410
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,322
Meanwhile, more and more police
are arriving at the scene.

411
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:46,243
ESU, you have one job:
Find and stop Daredevil.

412
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,121
The rest of you, we don't
know which FBI agents

413
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,604
- Fisk has in his pocket, so...
- Sure hope this wasn't Matt.

414
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,677
You came back.

415
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,055
Police are on their way up.
Can you shut down the elevators?

416
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,017
- Why?
- So nobody stops me.

417
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,659
It's over.

418
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,244
Run.

419
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,694
- What about you?
- Keep it, please.

420
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,742
I'll meet you downstairs. Go!

421
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,698
Stop.

422
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,584
Stop it, please!

423
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:22,394
I will never stop hunting
Karen Page or Foggy Nelson.

424
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,856
I will tell the world
who you really are.

425
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,899
Wilson.

426
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,903
Vanessa, please go. Please!

427
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,156
You...

428
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,950
You want me to kill you.

429
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,868
No prison can keep me.

430
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,452
You know that.

431
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,582
- Come on, kill me!
- No!

432
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,877
God knows I want to, but you
don't get to destroy who I am.

433
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,921
You will go back to prison,

434
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:53,550
and you will live the rest of
your miserable life in a cage,

435
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,386
knowing you'll never have Vanessa,

436
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,264
that this city rejected you.

437
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,599
It beat you.

438
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,143
I beat you!

439
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,275
You'll keep my secret,

440
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,821
and you won't harm Karen
Page or Foggy Nelson

441
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,156
or anyone else.

442
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:21,036
Because if you do, I
will go after your wife.

443
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:27,834
And I will prove Vanessa ordered
the murder of Agent Ray Nadeem,

444
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,086
and like her husband,

445
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,839
she'll spend the rest
of her life in a cell.

446
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,307
I failed you. I failed you.

447
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,475
No.

448
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,602
Everything that I
tried to build for us...

449
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,357
Vanessa...

450
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,779
today was the happiest day of my life.

451
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,500
All I wanted was you.

452
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,169
Please.

453
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,311
If I agree to your demands, then...

454
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,731
you leave my wife alone.

455
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,901
You leave Vanessa free!

456
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,951
If you keep your word.

457
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,418
Then, it's a deal.

458
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,698
Wilson Fisk, you are under arrest.

459
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,911
I can't move.

460
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,539
He isn't the real Daredevil.

461
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,332
How do you know?

462
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,293
Because he is.

463
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,732
He's alive.

464
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,026
Thank God.

465
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,164
Please, give me a moment
to say goodbye to my wife.

466
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,167
- Did you give one to Ray Nadeem?
- Please.

467
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,423
Please!

468
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,312
Matt should be here.

469
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,525
Well, I'm pretty sure he is.

470
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,994
Last time we spoke, I
confronted Father Lantom.

471
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,247
I was angry.

472
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,166
I'd change that if I could.

473
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,753
If God allowed that,
there'd be no future.

474
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,799
- Just people endlessly rewriting the past.
- Yeah.

475
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,387
I think he was trying to
tell me that for a long time.

476
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:55,560
His last words were, "Forgive us."

477
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,149
Do you think that's possible?

478
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,666
He told me something, years ago,

479
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:14,495
when this happened, that I never forgot.

480
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:21,419
See, I was pretty angry at God
and bitter towards his world.

481
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,215
How could a loving God blind me?

482
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,594
Why?

483
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:36,309
Anyway, he told me... God's plan
is like a beautiful tapestry.

484
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,654
And the tragedy of being human

485
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:41,022
is that we only get to
see it from the back.

486
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,526
With all the ragged threads
and the muddy colors.

487
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,447
And we only get a
hint at the true beauty

488
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,265
that would be revealed if we could see

489
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:53,534
the whole pattern on the other side...

490
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,496
as God does.

491
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,961
Anyway, I've been thinking a
lot about it recently, 'cause...

492
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,588
I realize I've made some bad choices

493
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,675
and hurt people that I
love without meaning to.

494
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,302
You don't always know when
you start down a false path.

495
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,972
No, you don't. And that's my point.

496
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,184
I realize that if my life had
turned out any differently,

497
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,186
that I would never
have become Daredevil.

498
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,524
And although people have died on
my watch, people who shouldn't have,

499
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,985
there are countless
others that have lived.

500
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:35,118
So, maybe it is all part of God's plan.

501
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,708
Maybe my life has been
exactly as it had to be.

502
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,381
You have a generous heart, Matthew.

503
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,510
To see the good in so much pain.

504
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,637
Not always.

505
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,810
In fact, Father Lantom
used to help me with that.

506
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,440
Help me see the errors of my ways.

507
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,155
I could use someone else
to help me with that now...

508
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,742
once in a while.

509
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,289
I'm a nun, Matthew.

510
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,210
Helping is what I was called to do.

511
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,801
Feels like half of Hell's
Kitchen is here today

512
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,179
to say goodbye to Father Paul Lantom.

513
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,640
Seems fair.

514
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,852
He certainly welcomed
everyone here, Catholic or not.

515
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,356
And he expected those of us who were

516
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,984
to, uh, look for ways to
do good in our community.

517
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,613
Not even the kids got
out of that requirement.

518
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,158
I'm sure I'm not the only one
who remembers his "suggestion"

519
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:43,538
that we give some of our First
Communion money to the poor box.

520
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,665
And that was his way.

521
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,878
To think of the community, and the,
uh... and the individuals in it.

522
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,632
To think in terms of, "What can I give?"

523
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,928
He gave his life, right here in
this church, protecting others.

524
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,974
Standing up to a man who used fear

525
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,434
as a tool to set neighbors
against one another.

526
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,981
If Father Lantom had an
enemy, I would say it was fear.

527
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,999
For me, personally, he spent
many years trying to get me

528
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,320
to face my own fears.

529
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,865
To understand how they enslaved me,

530
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,868
how they divided me from
the people that I love.

531
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,745
He counseled me to transcend my fears,

532
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,707
to be brave enough to forgive...

533
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,670
and see the possibilities
of being a man without fear.

534
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,798
That was his legacy.

535
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,762
And now it's up to all of
us to, uh, live up to it.

536
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,445
That was nice, what you said.

537
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,324
Yeah, it wasn't just him, you know.

538
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,243
It was you, too.

539
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,456
You helped me see the
truth about myself.

540
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,044
Ouch. That had to hurt.

541
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,465
Well, maybe one of these
days, I'll forgive you, too.

542
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,219
Before my funeral, I hope.

543
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,722
I'm glad you told me, Karen.

544
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,684
About Wesley and your brother.

545
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,270
Yeah.

546
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:32,939
Well, uh...

547
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,525
I couldn't live with that lie forever.

548
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,154
We're all just trying to
do more good than harm.

549
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,115
And I'd say you're ahead on that score.

550
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,794
I was starting to like the
idea of being married to the DA.

551
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,880
Pretty sure Blake Tower's not married.

552
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,216
Yeah, he'll have to get by without me.

553
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,261
You, on the other hand, are in luck.

554
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,763
The firm will be
thrilled to have you back.

555
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,557
The thing is, Marci...

556
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,143
I'm not sure I want that anymore.

557
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,106
I was afraid you were going
to say something like that.

558
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,733
You're not mad?

559
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,486
We'll talk about it later.

560
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,864
But do I really have to watch you
drive your campaign off a cliff?

561
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,242
Nah. I got that part covered.

562
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,411
... that Wilson Fisk
is a malignant tumor.

563
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,747
Well, the State of New York isn't
going to make the same mistake.

564
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:36,168
Everyone knows his game now. Fisk
won't manipulate the system again.

565
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,213
Excuse me, Mr. Tower.

566
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,798
Mr. Nelson.

567
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,886
I wanted you to be the first to hear

568
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,181
that I'm officially dropping out
of the race for district attorney.

569
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,145
The way you stood up to Wilson
Fisk was an inspiration to us all.

570
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,814
I'm gonna be voting for you.

571
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,358
Thank you.

572
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,615
- Hey there, Matty!
- Uncle Timmy.

573
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,744
- How are those briefs doing?
- Still stapled together.

574
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,287
Attaboy.

575
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,833
Of course, we're gonna have
to buy sunscreen by the bucket.

576
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,793
Better than that rock salt.

577
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:20,755
Enough with the snow and ice.
We're getting out of here.

578
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,840
I can't believe you're finally doing it.

579
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:27,386
Guess I'll have to get used to the
idea of Christmas in Tampa. Yikes!

580
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,889
Like I'd miss the
grandkids at Christmas.

581
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,652
- Speaking of which...
- Hold that thought.

582
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,559
I need to talk to Theo for a minute.

583
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,607
- You know she ain't giving up.
- You don't have to, either.

584
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,777
Me? I don't even have a girlfriend.

585
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,322
I mean on this place. Tower's
taking down Red Lion Bank.

586
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,032
You talked to him?

587
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,370
He's not going to prosecute a sweet
old couple who got screwed by Fisk.

588
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,747
You, though...

589
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:56,874
What about me?

590
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,334
If you pay back the loan...

591
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,253
they won't file criminal charges.

592
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:06,675
That's some fancy lawyering,
Foggy. You're really saving my ass.

593
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,179
Eh. Who wanted to be DA anyway?

594
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,847
You're too good-looking for that job.

595
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:12,931
Ow!

596
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,725
So, what are you gonna do now?

597
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,519
Drink these.

598
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,270
Good plan.

599
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,024
Is that a whiskey neat?

600
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,903
- For medicinal purposes.
- Mmm-hmm.

601
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,323
You want me to get you your own?

602
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,201
Oh, this one tastes fine.

603
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,495
- Give Matt his drink back.
- Yes.

604
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:41,168
So, I guess you guys heard, Special
Agent in Charge Hattley flipped.

605
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,588
- She corroborated Ray's dying declaration.
- I did hear.

606
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,672
Hmm.

607
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,969
So, the FBI is getting
an enema, and Fisk is...

608
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,140
- still breathing.
- Yep. Still breathing.

609
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,976
Headed to prison. Again.

610
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,186
Not exactly what I had in mind.

611
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,189
You trust that he'll keep his word?

612
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,984
I mean, I trust that he loves Vanessa.

613
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,654
Long as she's free, he should stay away.

614
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:12,366
- And if she gets hit by a bus tomorrow?
- Yeah. Well, then we'll cross that bridge.

615
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,621
So, how long you gonna stick around?

616
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:23,127
Actually, I was thinking about
moving back into my apartment.

617
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,211
Really?

618
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,881
Well, seeing as the bills
are paid, I might as well.

619
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,717
Okay, so hold on. You're going to move

620
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,137
- back into Matt Murdock's apartment?
- Yeah, yeah.

621
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,390
I just figured he has a
healthier life-work balance.

622
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,641
Hmm?

623
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,436
And... actual friends.

624
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,606
Doesn't have a job, though.
He's kind of a mooch.

625
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,858
Semi-decent lawyer, though.

626
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,943
Ooh... "Semi-decent"? Ouch.

627
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,197
You do break the law. A lot. And often.

628
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,116
Objection. Sustained.

629
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,121
I have a crazy idea.
I need a new napkin.

630
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:08,881
- Okay. Well, he's writing something.
- Apparently.

631
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,263
What?

632
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,352
Oh, he just wrote all
of our names, didn't he?

633
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,937
How can you know that?

634
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,357
- 'Cause I was thinking the same thing.
- Okay. Okay, guys, I'm not a lawyer.

635
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,109
You're one hell of an investigator.

636
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,737
Yeah, and way more
stable than Jessica Jones.

637
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,631
All right, so what? What does that mean?

638
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,452
We go back to helping people
out of a crappy office,

639
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,954
getting paid in chickens?

640
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,040
I think Theo would let us
work out of here, to start.

641
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,334
At least we'd have a
place to sell the chickens.

642
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,630
So what do you think?

643
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,176
Why the hell not?

644
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,638
To Nelson, Murdock & Page.

645
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,058
- Page, Murdock & Nelson.
- Hang on a minute.

646
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,726
That actually has a nice ring to it.

647
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,574
Doctor, if this fails, he'll
be permanently paralyzed.

648
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,869
T8 and T9 are falling apart.

649
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,873
Even using cadaver material,
reconstruction is hopeless.

650
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,126
I disagree.

651
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,297
The Cogmium steel
reinforcing framework is...

652
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,216
Can't replace pulverized
vertebrae, Dr. Oyama.

653
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,719
The patient knew the risks.

654
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,304
We continue.
