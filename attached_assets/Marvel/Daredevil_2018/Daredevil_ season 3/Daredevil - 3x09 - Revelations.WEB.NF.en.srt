2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,905
That's $80. Unless you want
to go double or nothing.

3
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,228
- You hustling me, grandpa?
- You tell me.

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,909
Did you know, Father?

5
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,788
Matthew? What are you doing here?

6
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,331
Did you know she was my mother?

7
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,463
Yeah.

8
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:48,924
You knew.

9
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,886
I couldn't tell you.

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,139
Even when I wanted to.

11
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,225
Don't hide behind your collar, Father.

12
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,478
- Wait. You're a priest?
- Take your money and go.

13
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,484
I'm not hiding, Matthew.

14
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,987
- I'm right here.
- You...

15
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,991
of all people...

16
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,537
All those times I looked
to you for guidance.

17
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,374
You saw me struggling...

18
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,011
and you chose to hide the one thing

19
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:28,046
that could have changed
everything for me.

20
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:35,387
Please, Father, help me
understand why you would do that.

21
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:42,561
I prayed for Maggie to find it
in herself to tell you years ago.

22
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,992
She couldn't find it in herself

23
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:47,316
to walk nine blocks
to visit me as a kid.

24
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:52,988
Or to comfort me when my father
was murdered and I thought that...

25
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:57,909
I knew that I was alone in this world.

26
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,536
- You were never alone...
- Yes, I was!

27
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,998
And you let me believe it.

28
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,629
Yes. Yes, we did.

29
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,548
Why?

30
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,180
- What did Maggie say?
- I'm asking you.

31
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,390
Maggie's a good person, Matthew.

32
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,310
Flawed, like us all.

33
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,897
And tortured over decisions she's made.

34
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,360
But she dedicated her
life to making amends.

35
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,613
You still haven't answered the question.

36
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,866
Growing up without
your parents, Matthew,

37
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,870
you don't grow to see them as people.

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,915
You need to understand that...

39
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,584
to understand her.

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,719
- We should go. This was a stupid idea.
- Definitely.

41
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,514
No, we're here. Let's
just give it a minute.

42
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,488
Three weeks from now, we're
not going anywhere anymore.

43
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,074
- True.
- Just a minute.

44
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,959
- Hey.
- Me?

45
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,545
Yeah, you. Can you
give me a hand up here?

46
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,715
- No, I can't.
- Yeah, you got to.

47
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,843
Come on, it's only gonna take me
60 seconds to put this asshole down.

48
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,219
Three minutes, tops.

49
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:43,348
- Okay, now is a good time to leave.
- Yes, it is. Let's go.

50
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,930
What do you need me to do?

51
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,143
Nothing much.

52
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,895
Just gotta give me some water,
maybe wipe off my face, like that.

53
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,272
Come on.

54
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,858
Maggie, obedience, poverty...

55
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,484
Chastity.

56
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,862
You ever done this before?
You got brothers or something?

57
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,947
No. Never seen a fight before, either.

58
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,031
Shit.

59
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,675
Then why'd you pick me to come up here?

60
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,453
I just figured a nun wouldn't
put something in my bottle.

61
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,536
It's gonna be all right.

62
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,237
You just gotta put my
mouth guard in my teeth

63
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:08,750
at the start of the rounds.

64
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,001
Maybe give me some water
between rounds, too.

65
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,044
I thought you said you
only needed 60 seconds.

66
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:17,549
Yeah. Well, it's just a
backup plan. You never know.

67
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,529
Water.

68
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,198
Yeah, come on. I only got a minute.

69
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,869
- Can you get that?
- Get that?

70
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,287
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

71
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,634
Maggie, what is wrong with you?

72
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,763
Maggie?

73
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,825
Maggie.

74
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,453
Maggie.

75
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,986
Damn, I don't know
what I should've done.

76
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,198
I guess that's not really true.

77
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,744
You know, when I heard
Maggie call me her son,

78
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:56,625
my thought was... my first
thought... was how stupid I'd been.

79
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,128
That it had been right in
front of me for so long.

80
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:08,094
And then I remembered that it had
been in front of you for even longer.

81
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,056
From... From the beginning.

82
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,561
We've talked so much about truth...

83
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,147
you and I.

84
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,568
Of my truth, God's truth.

85
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:33,745
Now it seems like all those
conversations were just a goddamned lie.

86
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,501
Shame on you.

87
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,633
We couldn't do this at the office?
We had to come all the way out here?

88
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,264
Once I explain everything to you
and the SAC, you'll understand, sir.

89
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,724
Shit, I better.

90
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,151
- Sorry about this, boss.
- Come in, guys.

91
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,694
Mom?

92
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,116
- Where did you put them?
- Give me a sec?

93
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,492
Like you'd understand.

94
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,203
I understand, Allison. I
just don't care. Now, move it.

95
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,332
- Make sure your dad signs those papers.
- I know. I know. Bye, Mom.

96
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,800
At least she talks to you.

97
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,802
I can't pry my girls
away from their phones.

98
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,679
You say that like it's a bad thing.

99
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,556
Sorry about the mess.

100
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,142
My contractor promised he
would be done months ago.

101
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,103
- How do you take it?
- Black is fine, thanks.

102
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,148
Uh, none for me.

103
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,527
Thanks.

104
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,585
Interview with Special
Agent Rahul Nadeem

105
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:43,958
and Special Agent in
Charge Tammy Hattley,

106
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,795
conducted by Supervisory
Special Agent Winn,

107
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,340
FBI Office of Professional
Responsibility.

108
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,593
Okay, Ray. You've got our attention.

109
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,512
What's this about?

110
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,601
There's no good way for me to say this.

111
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,983
But I believe Wilson Fisk is currently
engaged in a criminal conspiracy

112
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,071
and has manipulated the bureau into
becoming his unwitting accomplice.

113
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,652
I also have reason to believe

114
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,953
that Fisk has corrupted
an agent on his detail.

115
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,037
Who?

116
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,706
Dex.

117
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,918
You're referring to Special
Agent Ben Poindexter?

118
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,255
Yes, sir. And as crazy as it sounds,

119
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,968
I think Poindexter may have
perpetrated the attack at the Bulletin.

120
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,637
What the hell are you talking
about? Why would you think that?

121
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,850
Because while I was pursuing
those suspicions yesterday...

122
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,646
Dex shot me.

123
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,772
Jesus Christ.

124
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:55,071
Sir, OPR needs to start an
internal investigation into Fisk,

125
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,031
into Poindexter, into all of it.

126
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,575
And for the record...

127
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,619
this was on my watch.

128
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,581
I personally ran Fisk's detail.

129
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,587
SAC Hattley did everything by the
book, and this shouldn't fall on her.

130
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,133
I take full responsibility.

131
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,055
Ray, I'm sorry, but I'm placing
you on administrative leave,

132
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,265
effective immediately.

133
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,353
I understand.

134
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,481
And will cooperate fully.

135
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,339
So...

136
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,507
what do we do next?

137
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,302
First, we call you an ambulance.

138
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,224
No!

139
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,812
Ray! Put down the gun! Please!

140
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,447
Damn you, Ray. You
bring this into my house?

141
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,199
My home?

142
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:24,786
Sit down.

143
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,914
Sit.

144
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,346
Your prints, your weapon, the recording.

145
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,723
Do I need to explain
to you what this means?

146
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:50,979
Answer my question, please. Do
you understand your situation now?

147
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,399
Ray?

148
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,318
You get this?

149
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,701
Yeah, boss.

150
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,829
I understand.

151
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,748
I'm not your boss anymore.

152
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,253
Wilson Fisk is.

153
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,211
You don't have to run.
Hiding is an option.

154
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,963
I'm not so sure it is, Foggy.
Not after what I said to Fisk.

155
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,716
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

156
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,511
But I wouldn't bother paying
the rent like we did for Matt.

157
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,638
Come on. You'll be back.

158
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,557
Foggy, Fisk is never
gonna stop hunting me.

159
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,519
Then don't run or hide. Do what I did.

160
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,938
Make yourself so public
he can't touch you.

161
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,023
Yeah, well, it's not
gonna matter, Foggy.

162
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,069
My DA campaign's kept me
out of his crosshairs so far.

163
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,655
Yeah, well, you didn't confess
to killing his BFF, so...

164
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,448
Valid point.

165
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,536
- But maybe...
- Look, Foggy. I'm running.

166
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,208
Right after I tell Matt
I completely betrayed him.

167
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,211
Come on.

168
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,714
You didn't betray him.

169
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,926
Fisk knows that Matt is
Daredevil because of me.

170
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,472
He can't actually know that for
sure. You didn't say anything.

171
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,058
No, you weren't there. He, uh...

172
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,228
The way he looked at me...

173
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,897
He knows.

174
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,653
Just, uh, destroy these for me?

175
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,539
- No, Foggy...
- Please take it.

176
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,126
Thank you.

177
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,587
I should go.

178
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,970
We're gonna get through this.
I don't know how, but we will.

179
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,812
Watch your back. Please.

180
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,289
Change can be scary, Marcus.

181
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,792
Even when it's for the good.

182
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,211
No, it's not.

183
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,506
Oh...

184
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:50,510
You know, the Dockerys
are a wonderful family,

185
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,345
and now you get to be a part of it.

186
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,850
But you will always be a
part of our family, too.

187
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,899
Maggie.

188
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,612
What is it, Paul?

189
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,366
Matthew knows.

190
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,094
Oh...

191
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,536
I guess you know everything now, Matty.

192
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,625
Everything I need to.

193
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,755
Meh. Doesn't change a goddamn thing.

194
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,016
- Ray?
- Yeah?

195
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,976
You have a visitor from work.

196
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,733
My hand's not big enough.

197
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,151
Sure it is. Look.

198
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,863
Just keep your fingers
like that, hugging the seam,

199
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,574
and just snap your wrist
when you release it.

200
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,201
And that makes it curve?

201
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,036
Like crazy.

202
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,165
There he is. Morning, Ray.

203
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,835
Dad, he's teaching me
how to throw a curveball.

204
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,503
You want eggs?

205
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,172
Uh, no, thanks.

206
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,426
- Go get ready for school, Sami.
- But, Dad...

207
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,844
School first, kid.

208
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,345
Okay.

209
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,598
This is cool. Thanks, Mr. Poindexter.

210
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,018
Call me Dex. Your dad
and me go way back.

211
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,402
So, Dex, what brings you to my house?

212
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,405
Well, you've been bragging about
Seema's cooking for so long,

213
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,842
I figured I'd come up with an
excuse to finally come try it.

214
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,911
You don't need an excuse, Dex.
What you've done for our family...

215
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,957
... you're always welcome here.

216
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,543
Honey, we're gonna talk shop.

217
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,466
Oh. Okay. But only for a few minutes.

218
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,213
I don't want Dex's eggs getting cold.

219
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,648
What are you doing here, Dex? Your
issue is with me, not my family.

220
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,735
My issue is definitely with you.

221
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:22,406
That stunt with the
lawyer, Ray? That was cold.

222
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,494
You convinced me that you had my back.

223
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,206
But Fisk wants you alive.

224
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,417
What does he want from me, Dex?

225
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,130
Your friend. The one
you brought to my home.

226
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,967
I don't know who he is. Or where he is.

227
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,594
Yeah, you do.

228
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,096
But it can wait.

229
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:48,974
You're bleeding, Ray.

230
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,278
I'll cover with Seema
while you change your shirt.

231
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:04,573
Now, let's go. We're spending
the day together, partner.

232
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,243
It smells delicious.

233
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,455
Taste as good as it looks?

234
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,165
Shit.

235
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,756
I have a super for that.

236
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,008
I can fix this, damn it.

237
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,636
- You okay?
- Peachy.

238
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,640
Karen and Matt can do whatever
they want. I'm not gonna run.

239
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,142
You can't quit now.
You're giving people hope.

240
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,103
Mrs. Wobschall stopped
me in the produce aisle.

241
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,771
At first, I didn't believe her,

242
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,690
but then she showed me
a clip on her iPhone.

243
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,442
You were a natural. Totally amazing.

244
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,820
What are you talking about?

245
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,823
Because when you get
beyond the cold facts,

246
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,285
and you really get worked up
about what you're doing, you can...

247
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,911
Holy shit.

248
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,635
We've got to work on your closing,

249
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,917
but this video has had nearly
100,000 views in its first 24 hours.

250
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,729
Half the cops in New York have
reposted it to their personal accounts.

251
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,171
Has Blake Tower responded?

252
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,173
Complete radio silence.

253
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,127
Probably because you've
successfully branded him

254
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:06,218
as the pro-Fisk candidate

255
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,220
and anything he says
will only make it worse.

256
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:12,474
- Wow.
- Foggy, if you play this right...

257
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,268
I could actually win.

258
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:22,234
And as the new DA, you make it your
top priority to nail Wilson Fisk.

259
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,157
I don't have much time.
Fisk is doing something.

260
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,617
Specifics, Ray.

261
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,369
I don't know what. But
when I do, I'll call you.

262
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,079
Be ready.

263
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,585
It's done.

264
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,587
Nice work, partner.

265
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,474
It's a shitty way for you to find
out, Matty, about your mother.

266
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,060
Yeah. You should have told me.

267
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,230
Maybe I promised her that I wouldn't.

268
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,982
That is no excuse.

269
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,651
Yeah, I know, kid.

270
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,235
But after I took that bullet,

271
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,863
Maggie had years to tell
you the truth and she didn't.

272
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,949
That wasn't my choice, it was hers.

273
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,534
You both lied. You both left.

274
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,623
I never left you.

275
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,292
You didn't go down in that
fight like you were supposed to.

276
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,961
Knowing they'd kill you for it.

277
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,712
I did that for you.

278
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,881
So you'd know what
your old man is made of.

279
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,195
My old man chose his ego

280
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:29,218
over a lifetime with his
son. That's what I know.

281
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,305
It wasn't ego, it was
living up to a code.

282
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,891
Being a man.

283
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,813
It means lovin' the feel of
my fist in someone else's face.

284
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,524
It means waiting for
them to hit the ground

285
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,401
and knowing that I put them there.

286
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,528
And, yeah, okay...

287
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,658
maybe I put that at the top of my
list and maybe it cost me everything,

288
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,867
including you.

289
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,913
But you do the same thing.

290
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,291
No, I don't.

291
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,628
You have a code, too. You
beat the shit out of people.

292
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,297
You tell yourself it's okay
because you didn't kill anyone.

293
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:12,761
There is something wrong with
us, Matty. It's just who we are.

294
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,722
That's who you were, Dad.

295
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,391
I'm not like you.

296
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,352
I don't throw fights.

297
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,481
And I don't let everyone else
suffer 'cause of some bullshit code.

298
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,775
Not anymore.

299
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,072
When I get to Fisk...

300
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,367
I'm gonna kill him.

301
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,762
- Sister Maggie... Sister Maggie?
- Devin.

302
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,774
Excuse me, Sister Maggie?

303
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,111
I'm sorry to bother you. They
told me I could find you here.

304
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,948
He's gone. I don't know where.

305
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,692
It's a matter of life and death.

306
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:21,293
Do you have any idea when he'll be back?

307
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,708
He won't be.

308
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,294
I...

309
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,130
I don't understand. Why? Why not?

310
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,512
He learned the truth.

311
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,474
That I'm his mother.

312
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,229
Wow. Uh...

313
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,651
He never talked about... about you.

314
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,864
I was a danger to Matthew
when I gave him up.

315
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,370
Nowadays, they know a great
deal about postpartum, but...

316
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,372
at the time...

317
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,837
I was convinced that
I was betraying God.

318
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:17,594
I hadn't yet taken my
vows, but in my heart...

319
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,057
I believed I had committed
an unforgivable sin.

320
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,310
And so I replaced that sin with another.

321
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,398
I abandoned my child.

322
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,237
Why... Why did you tell him now?

323
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,074
I didn't. He found out on his own.

324
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,743
I wanted to tell him.

325
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,150
When Jack was alive,

326
00:27:44,151 --> 00:27:49,084
I convinced myself the
truth would confuse Matthew.

327
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,839
After Jack died, I convinced myself
it would do more harm than good.

328
00:27:54,506 --> 00:28:00,596
Finally, I just realized that
I was too much of a coward.

329
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,474
The Lord has a way.

330
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,521
Sending the Devil of
Hell's Kitchen to me now.

331
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,109
Showing me what became of my sin.

332
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,906
The Lord gave me another
chance to make things right.

333
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,993
And I failed, yet again.

334
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,498
Matthew knows who and what I am now.

335
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,418
He won't be back.

336
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,429
I'm sorry. It's unfair
of me to burden you.

337
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:47,184
I just... I don't...

338
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,937
I don't know what to say.

339
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,484
What can you say to someone who's
scarred your friend for life?

340
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,950
He must be in a lot of pain right now.

341
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,372
When you find him, he'll need a friend.

342
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,961
That's just it. See, I
can't really stick around.

343
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,128
Um...

344
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,933
Fisk knows... about Matt. I just...

345
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:23,929
I just wanted to warn him before I run.

346
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,765
- Are you in danger?
- Yeah.

347
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,518
Matt's not the only one
that Fisk wants dead.

348
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,395
Do you have someplace to go?

349
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,772
No, I was just gonna get
the first bus out of town.

350
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,442
I can help you.

351
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,282
Uh, yeah, no, you don't want me
anywhere near you right now. Trust me.

352
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,868
The church has been helping
people hide for 2,000 years.

353
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,412
Hide here.

354
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,415
Give me a day to make a few calls,

355
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,203
and you'll have shelter
halfway around the world

356
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:55,460
by the end of the week.

357
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:01,466
Please, let me do something for you.

358
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,886
For Matthew.

359
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,014
Yeah.

360
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,450
Everybody, I have an announcement.

361
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,369
And some good news after a shitty week.

362
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,039
I'm happy to tell you that

363
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:35,167
Special Agent Poindexter
has been reinstated to duty.

364
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,737
Turns out even DC

365
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:41,214
can't hold good deeds
against someone forever.

366
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,666
Seriously, people...

367
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,179
the way you came together and
helped Dex hire that lawyer...

368
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,847
I'm proud of you.

369
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,975
If we don't look out
for each other, who will?

370
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,062
You got anything to say, Dex?

371
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,356
Uh...

372
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,317
I guess I just wanna say thank you.

373
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,652
I wouldn't be here without your help.

374
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,322
Especially you, Ray.

375
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,076
Someday, I'll pay you back
for everything you did.

376
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,042
You look good, Franklin.

377
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,378
I'm still passionate
about what the law can do.

378
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,798
Maybe a haircut next time, though.

379
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,966
He's making quite the name for himself.

380
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,929
Theo, you gotta see this
movie your brother's in.

381
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,223
Let me fix you a plate,
sweetie. Come here.

382
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,017
Hold on, Ma. I need a
couple minutes with Foggy.

383
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,436
I'll be quick.

384
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,563
Don't worry about her,
Foggy. She'll be fine.

385
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,942
So, Marci, have you
considered freezing your eggs?

386
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,944
- It's never too late.
- Anna!

387
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,863
This better be important.

388
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,108
All that stuff you said
about Fisk on the video,

389
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,077
you gotta take it back.

390
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,122
- What are you talking about?
- You have to make a different video, man.

391
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,791
Issue a statement or
whatever. Say you were drunk.

392
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,376
Au contraire, mon frère.

393
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,294
That's the last thing I gotta do.

394
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:05,424
I gotta exploit this opportunity
to expose everything Fisk is doing.

395
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:09,344
No, no, no. Foggy, listen
to me. You need to apologize.

396
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:14,015
What happened? Did someone
come after you, Theo?

397
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,309
Fog, it's real bad.

398
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,857
About a year ago, some of our
suppliers stopped taking our orders.

399
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,568
Just stopped. No reason
I could understand.

400
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,273
We couldn't change their
minds for the love of money.

401
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,032
After a few months, the shop was
in a tight spot financially, right?

402
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,326
And we didn't have the
collateral to get a loan...

403
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,787
Why didn't you come to
me? I could have helped.

404
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,123
I didn't have to, because
of what happened next.

405
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,042
Out of the blue, I get this
call from a bank I never heard of

406
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,962
offering to help us out. Red Lion Bank.

407
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,215
- Shit.
- You know these guys?

408
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,718
Just keep going.

409
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,554
So, the loan officer there,

410
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,557
he coaches me on how to
move the numbers around.

411
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,226
Make our assets look
healthier, you know.

412
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,937
And bam! The loan comes
through without a hitch.

413
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,565
I don't give it another
thought. Life goes on.

414
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,651
I mean, we've been
through a lot around here.

415
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,279
And the old suppliers came back.

416
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,157
Yeah. Yeah, they did,
now you mention it.

417
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,326
And then someone came to talk to you?

418
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,997
This afternoon, yeah. This old
English dude comes to see me.

419
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,958
He knew all about the creative
accounting on the loan app.

420
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,545
He said unless I could convince you

421
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,089
to walk back everything
you said about Fisk...

422
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,800
he'd have Red Lion call the loan.

423
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,178
Of course.

424
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,139
Foggy, that application...

425
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,559
if anyone looks too carefully at it...

426
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,186
You're going to jail.

427
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,563
Not just me.

428
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,067
Mom and Dad signed it, too.

429
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,539
We have a new teammate today.

430
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,500
Take a seat, Ray.

431
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:10,882
I don't believe it. Fisk's
got something on all of you?

432
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:23,979
Arinori?

433
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,817
Better we don't talk about it. And
in here, we don't even say his name.

434
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:34,155
That's one of the rules, Ray. We
only refer to him by his code name.

435
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,992
What code name?

436
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,869
Kingpin.

437
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,584
Another roundup, gentlemen. And
we're going to hit them fast and hard.

438
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,545
Kingpin wants this one to make a point.

439
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,220
FBI! Don't move!

440
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,139
Shit. It's the feds!

441
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,143
Down on the ground, now!

442
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,563
- Stay where you are.
- No.

443
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,940
John Hammer, you're coming with us.

444
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,298
Good morning, Mr. Starr.

445
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,227
I got this one.

446
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,861
Please come quietly.

447
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,087
- Shift change, guys.
- We just came on an hour ago.

448
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,797
Hattley's orders.

449
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:17,342
I think she's punishing me for
getting off suspension so fast.

450
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,469
And thanks for bringing
me along for the ride.

451
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,638
She's the boss.

452
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,309
See you later.

453
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,280
So what was it? Money?

454
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,492
I've known you for ten
years, for Chrissakes.

455
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,993
Shut your goddamn mouth.

456
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,830
Or what? You'll frame
me for another murder?

457
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,874
Keep your head forward.

458
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,795
There's no mics in here, but
you know they're watching.

459
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,216
You murdered Winn. How
do you live with that?

460
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,970
I killed him to save your life.

461
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,558
That's right. This is on you.

462
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,686
I didn't tell you to
break into Dex's apartment.

463
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,896
I would've stopped you,
and you wouldn't be here.

464
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,733
But here you are.

465
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,320
I can't believe you want this.

466
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,782
We made this happen. We
can find a way to end it.

467
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,994
There's no way out, Ray.

468
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,872
Fisk's had you marked
for more than a year.

469
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,794
What do you mean, had me marked?

470
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,214
Why do you think your
sister-in-law lost health coverage?

471
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,342
He made you desperate for this job,

472
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,586
you did everything you could
to get him this penthouse,

473
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,013
get him everything he asked for.

474
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,560
Like I said, there's no way out.

475
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,647
We're out of our league here.

476
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,367
You could've gone to
Homeland Security or the NYPD.

477
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,828
Not take me down with
you. Not murder an agent.

478
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,873
You make a report. You get your
family somewhere safe. Jesus.

479
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,541
That's not an option with Fisk.

480
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,797
I used to have two children, Ray.

481
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,091
They made it look like a hit-and-run.

482
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,303
I got a divorce. Maybe that
keeps him a little safer.

483
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,807
But there's still Allie, so...

484
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,643
Think about Seema and Sami.

485
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,063
And do what Fisk tells you.

486
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,284
- Where is Mrs. Shelby?
- She's on her way, sir.

487
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,620
No.

488
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,122
Nadeem.

489
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,571
Let's go.

490
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,179
- Yeah?
- Fisk has left the hotel.

491
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,556
How is that possible?

492
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,685
I don't think Dex was the
only FBI agent he turned.

493
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,897
But he's taking Fisk to
meet with other crime bosses.

494
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,400
- Some kind of sit-down.
- Where?

495
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:49,364
I'm texting you the address. But
if you catch Fisk in the act...

496
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,326
This is our chance to take
him down. Thank you, Nadeem.

497
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,668
We'll meet you inside, Nadeem.

498
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,969
What do you want me to do?

499
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,679
Be ready.

500
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,809
Daredevil will know it's a
trap, but he'll come anyway.

501
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,868
Red Fish Blue Restaurant,

502
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,733
48th Street and 9th Avenue.

503
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,656
You're not fallin' for that, are you?

504
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:36,035
That guy, he ain't in
your corner. Not anymore.

505
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,996
That doesn't matter.

506
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,792
It's been a long time since
you used Muay Thai ropes, Matty.

507
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:47,296
That guy in my suit kicked my ass.
I can't beat him from a distance.

508
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,717
I gotta draw him in
close and do more damage.

509
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,095
You're too mad to think straight.
And it's gonna get you killed.

510
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,724
Matty, come on.

511
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:04,897
Your mother didn't only
leave you. She left me, too.

512
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,985
You looking for sympathy?
'Cause that's not happening.

513
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,903
She left us because we're cursed.

514
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,241
Because she knew we
got the devil inside.

515
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,451
So it's my fault?

516
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,329
Would you be honest with yourself?

517
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,621
You put on that mask because
it lets you feel all right

518
00:42:26,622 --> 00:42:28,212
with who you really are.

519
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,271
It lets you hurt people

520
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:32,842
and makes you feel like it's
for something important...

521
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,344
... something good, maybe even for God.

522
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,431
But that ain't the truth,
and we both know it.

523
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,392
You and your father are
cut from the same cloth.

524
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:46,689
A corrupt boxer who takes as much
satisfaction in inflicting pain

525
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:49,067
as he does money for taking dives.

526
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,610
And his son,

527
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,822
who's trying to convince himself

528
00:42:51,823 --> 00:42:53,905
he's any better than
his criminal father.

529
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,492
You were born from nothing.

530
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,911
You remain nothing.

531
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,793
- Arrest me, or I'm leaving.
- Stay where you are.

532
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,419
We have a right to counsel.

533
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,133
This some bullshit.
What are we waiting for?

534
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,676
We'll know when it happens.

535
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,026
You know something
about what's going on?

536
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:04,225
Well, they pick us up all quiet
like. No press, no perp walk.

537
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,186
Take us here instead of
downtown. The feds want something.

538
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,003
- Fisk?
- What the hell is this?

539
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,590
It's an opportunity, Mr. Starr.

540
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:26,849
I've brought you here to
offer you my protection.

541
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:33,397
From investigations and prosecutions
by the federal government.

542
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,860
Bullshit. This is a sting.

543
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:42,073
Hey, jury, if you can hear this
on tape, I'm totally innocent.

544
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,033
I don't even know these people.

545
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,997
How much? What's the vig?

546
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,667
- Twenty percent.
- For Chrissake.

547
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,751
Of everything.

548
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,351
I don't know how you
keep that suit white

549
00:45:57,352 --> 00:45:59,590
with all the bullshit you pack into it.

550
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:04,303
I know what this is. We
all know what this is.

551
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,974
You want us to confess to something
that buys you another month

552
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,977
in that hotel suite you
conned yourself into.

553
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,356
No. You can count me out.

554
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,711
The tax is now 25 percent.

555
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,884
I gotta hand it to you, Fisk.
You know how to put on a show.

556
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:50,057
Just one question.
Where do I drop the cash?

557
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,350
If you tipped him...

558
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,061
I said exactly what you told me to say.

559
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,688
You were there.

560
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,028
Let's go.

561
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,423
Moving to Stairwell C. Weapons out.

562
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:02,893
Are you gonna kill me?

563
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,273
No.

564
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,859
Not you.

565
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,989
Fisk?

566
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,038
Oh, thank God.

567
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,207
When will he be back?

568
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,459
Minutes.

569
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,219
Thank you.

570
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,015
Karen Page located
at the Clinton Church.

571
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,055
Keep all NYPD units
clear of that location

572
00:51:44,056 --> 00:51:46,228
until otherwise advised. Copy?

573
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,689
What does Fisk want with Karen?

574
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,691
He wants her killed.

575
