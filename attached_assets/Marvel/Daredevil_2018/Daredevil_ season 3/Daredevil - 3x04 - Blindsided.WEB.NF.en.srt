2
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,536
Up! Up! Up! Room check!

3
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,748
Convict, stand and face the wall!

4
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,798
Comb the area.

5
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,677
We'll be conducting a
mandatory sweep of the area.

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,304
You're to cooperate with all
instructions. You understand?

7
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,514
I understand.

8
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,598
Check.

9
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,035
I am searching your person to
ensure you're not carrying anything

10
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,313
that might be harmful
to yourself or others.

11
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,439
Do you understand?

12
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:05,524
I understand.

13
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,608
Check.

14
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,610
Turn around.

15
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,540
Are we finished here?

16
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,710
All clear.

17
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,004
Oh, these mornings are
getting colder and colder.

18
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,030
Piece of crap can't keep up for nothing.

19
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,116
Where we off to, boss?

20
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,789
Matt shows up alive, then tells
me I'm never gonna see him again.

21
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,792
Only I, Foggy Nelson,
can be ghosted by a ghost.

22
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,883
It's locked. Like it was
the last time you checked it.

23
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,635
We need to get another
dead bolt installed.

24
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,888
A single dead bolt and a measly chain?

25
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,473
Might as well be a beaded curtain.

26
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,016
Foggy, relax.

27
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,393
Relax? Are you even listening to me?

28
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,979
Wilson Fisk wants my scalp.

29
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,064
And for all we know,
he wants yours, too.

30
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,788
It's not like you've
done him any favors.

31
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,301
And of course Matt wants me to stick

32
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:38,111
to the sidelines while
he deals with Fisk.

33
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,822
Only Matt Murdock is
fit for the real action.

34
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,365
- Just because I'm not...
- What?

35
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,660
Nothing.

36
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,750
I don't even know what
I'm saying anymore.

37
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,668
Foggy, breathe.

38
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,052
Matt was gone.

39
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,595
Now he's back.

40
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,890
Fisk is out, and I have no
idea where that leaves me.

41
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,062
Screw the sidelines.
We go on the offense.

42
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,898
Offense? With Fisk?

43
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,109
He has the law and the FBI on his side.

44
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,606
And it's not like
we've heard a statement

45
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:21,571
from the DA condemning his release.

46
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,116
No, no, nothing to jeopardize
Blake Tower's reelection.

47
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,285
God forbid he grow a pair.

48
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,120
Oh, that could work.

49
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,122
Blake Tower growing a
pair? Not gonna happen.

50
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,666
No, think about it.

51
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,043
The best way to protect
yourself from Fisk

52
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,672
is to make noise, is
to be out in the open.

53
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,215
Oh, like a public execution.

54
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,925
Like a public call to action.

55
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,344
If Blake Tower won't do
anything to stop Fisk,

56
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,139
then run against him
for district attorney.

57
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,141
If you're already a target,

58
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,811
you might as well be the
first person to take a swing.

59
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,354
No, I'm serious.

60
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,940
The more public, the
more you're protected.

61
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,276
There's no way I can win.

62
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,696
- Well, of course not.
- Thank you for the confidence.

63
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,740
Anyways, we're light-years
past the deadline.

64
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,950
Then run as a write-in.

65
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,828
You base your candidacy
on a single issue.

66
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,621
Putting Fisk back behind bars.

67
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,373
You'd bag a few votes.

68
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,626
I mean, not enough to win, but
you'd get the issue out there.

69
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,671
Plus, you'd make a few
friends in the NYPD, and...

70
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,215
that's not the worst thing
for a defense attorney.

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,011
Or you could keep checking the locks.

72
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,978
I won't let anything happen to you.

73
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,563
Oh, baby.

74
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,902
Then we better start
working on that swing.

75
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,946
After coffee.

76
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,615
You're buying.

77
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,423
Have you seen my wallet?

78
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,430
This is good?

79
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,432
Yeah, here's fine.

80
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,561
Hey, you paying with card?
'Cause, you know, cash is better.

81
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,771
Wait for me.

82
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,358
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

83
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,965
Hi. Good morning.

84
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,426
- Purpose for your visit?
- I have an appointment with my client.

85
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,470
I called earlier. I should
be on the visitor list.

86
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,604
I can't find my wallet.

87
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,400
Did I leave it at home,
or drop it in the cab...

88
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,111
- Without picture ID, I can't...
- Just give me one second.

89
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,364
- Sir, please step aside while...
- This is my New York Bar number.

90
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,741
Now, it's not picture ID, I know,

91
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,670
but it did take seven years

92
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:15,996
and cost me $300,000 in student loans.

93
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,789
Does it, uh, buy me anything?

94
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,878
Name?

95
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,340
Nelson. Franklin Nelson.

96
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,048
- How you doin'?
- Good.

97
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,716
- You're holding up?
- Mm-hmm.

98
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:55,929
Matt!

99
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,889
I thought Foggy...

100
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,492
- What's up, Michael?
- Oh, man.

101
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,684
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

102
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,687
- Even if it is in this shithole.
- I'm sure you're wondering...

103
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,606
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said shithole.

104
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,149
I'm trying not to curse.

105
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,322
What's the point of me getting
out of here in 18 months

106
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:11,569
with a degree in psychology,

107
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,196
top of my class...

108
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,240
if I still swear like a goddamn sailor?

109
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,991
- Did it again.
- Well, sorry.

110
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,076
Saint Matthew.

111
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,828
No, come on, I'm no saint.

112
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,664
You and Foggy got 16 years
knocked off my sentence.

113
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,916
If that's not divine intervention, huh?

114
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,002
Where is Foggy? I've
never seen you two apart.

115
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,464
We're not, uh... We're not
working together anymore.

116
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,842
- Aw, man, that sucks.
- Yeah.

117
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:39,264
Listen, I don't want anyone, even
Foggy, to know that I was here, so...

118
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,891
Yeah, I can do that.

119
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,728
- Appreciate it.
- So, what's the big mystery?

120
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,983
Yeah, so, look, you, um...
worked with the Albanians, right?

121
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,069
A long time ago.

122
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,114
- Low-level stuff. Mostly just running.
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,200
But they're offering
you protection in here?

124
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,830
What do you want with the Albanians?

125
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,957
I want an introduction.

126
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,536
If somebody needs a defense lawyer,

127
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll make sure to pass your name along.

128
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,380
Glowing review. But, you know,

129
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:12,755
folks in here, they're
murdering bastards.

130
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,341
I want an introduction to Vic Jusufi.

131
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,012
Nobody gets in with Vic.

132
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,139
You can't make it happen?

133
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,147
... and the extra two years added?

134
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,191
What do you want with him, anyway?

135
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,028
Wilson Fisk could've turned
on any crime organization.

136
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,529
I want to know why the Albanians.

137
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,364
What did they have on Fisk?

138
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,289
- Just, uh... let this go.
- No, I can't do that.

139
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,417
- Fisk stays out, innocent people die.
- I don't know shit.

140
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,002
Michael, you can help me.

141
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,085
- No.
- Come on.

142
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,881
You're gonna get me killed.

143
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,099
Get this guy away from
me! I don't know him!

144
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,018
Get him away! Get him away!

145
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,270
- That's enough!
- Assault by an inmate...

146
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,647
I said nothing.

147
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,857
On my mother! My mother!

148
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,119
- Sir?
- It's all right. It's just a misunderstanding.

149
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,279
Mr. Nelson, you need to get
checked out by the nurse.

150
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,364
It's fine. I'm fine.

151
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,574
Then you can say that
on an incident report.

152
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,035
Liability reasons. Can't let
you leave until you sign one.

153
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,997
Yeah, all right.

154
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,082
Follow me.

155
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,437
He's right in there.

156
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,689
Hi, boys.

157
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,735
- Hi.
- Hey.

158
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:08,121
I brought clothes, mouthwash,
and some leftover chole.

159
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,164
Thanks.

160
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,376
Hey, I'm sorry. It's gonna
be like this all week.

161
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,586
You promise me you'll
eat? Your face looks thin.

162
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,631
Fine. Okay, I'll eat.

163
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,174
I love you.

164
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,968
We gotta go.

165
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,637
What "we"? Is Sami here?

166
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,181
He's in the car, killing
aliens on my phone.

167
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,225
I'd love to see him. Bring him up.

168
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,728
You're working, and I
don't want to be late.

169
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,604
Late? Late for what?

170
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,189
Late for my sister's.

171
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,484
Sami is gonna stay there
for a couple of days.

172
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,611
Sami has a bed.

173
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,573
One that he can't sleep in.

174
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,790
What do you mean? What's going on?

175
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,960
He stays up all night,
waiting for you to come home.

176
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,462
He's been watching the news.

177
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,965
He's... He's scared something
is going to happen to you.

178
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,134
Look at me. I'm fine.

179
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,218
Are you?

180
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,221
'Cause Sami isn't the
only one who's scared.

181
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,892
Let him stay with Nav and the
kids. Get his mind off all of this.

182
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,603
No.

183
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,646
I'll talk to him when I come home.

184
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,107
Look... nothing bad
is gonna happen to me.

185
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,068
I was at the hospital.

186
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,737
I talked to the other spouses
waiting outside the ER.

187
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,482
None of those agents
thought anything bad

188
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,532
was going to happen to them, either.

189
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,578
I know how much this promotion means,

190
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,123
- but nothing is worth...
- We can talk about this later.

191
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,712
Sami is going to my sister's.

192
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,591
Make sure you eat.

193
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,942
Face the wall.

194
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:07,281
Let's go. Turn around. Against
the wall. Against the wall.

195
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,326
Now. Foreheads to the
wall. Let's go, gentlemen.

196
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,245
Spread your legs.

197
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,208
- Wait in here. Nurse should be by.
- Thanks.

198
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,140
Gelsdorf...

199
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,188
Hi. Yes.

200
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,481
I know you said you couldn't meet

201
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,276
until Friday morning,
but I found something.

202
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,195
I don't think it can wait till then.

203
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,447
Yes, absolutely. Off the record.

204
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,952
No, only somebody who works
at the FDIC can help me.

205
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,245
You will?

206
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,790
Thank you so much. No...
Yeah, tomorrow is perfect.

207
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:40,875
Great.

208
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,587
I think I figured out how Fisk has
been skirting the FBI asset freeze.

209
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,910
When's the last time you slept?

210
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,132
He's been funneling his
money through Vancorp,

211
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,216
which is the shell corporation
that owns the hotel,

212
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,346
and he's keeping it in an offshore
firm named Red Lion National Bank.

213
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,097
- Karen...
- That's the smoking gun.

214
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,350
If it's not smoking, it's
at least kinda warmish.

215
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,228
I didn't come to talk about Fisk.

216
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:02,939
What?

217
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,442
It's Matt?

218
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,239
They found a body?

219
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,450
I promised I would never lie
for Matt again. Not to you.

220
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,118
No, you have to just...

221
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,788
You need to just tell me.

222
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,212
Matt's alive.

223
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,258
Matt!

224
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,927
Matt, where the hell are you?

225
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,180
He's not here. I called.

226
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:39,517
Even asked Fran down the hall
if she saw anyone poking around.

227
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,394
She would know. She pokes.

228
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,106
Why? Why would he let us
think that he was dead?

229
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,528
It wasn't Matt that I saw, Karen.

230
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,946
I mean, not really.

231
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,614
It was Matt.

232
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,450
All five feet, ten inches of him, but...

233
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,537
the way that he spoke to me...

234
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,915
something was missing.

235
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,376
Well, that's nothing new.

236
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,045
There's always something
missing with Matt.

237
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:12,675
I used to think that it was... it
was busy lawyer, distracted Matt.

238
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,040
Then I thought it was
weight-of-the-world- on-his-shoulders Matt.

239
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,345
But you know what?

240
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,056
It's just Matt.

241
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,895
But it wasn't any of those.

242
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:33,279
I think a part of him was
buried under Midland Circle.

243
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,907
I don't know if he's coming back.

244
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,663
So much for him promising
he'd stop lying to us.

245
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,377
Letting us think he was dead.

246
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,172
A whopper.

247
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,972
I think Matt's made his choice.

248
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,020
It doesn't really leave
any room for either of us.

249
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,023
No.

250
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,985
I guess it doesn't.

251
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,373
Well, I am not going to sit here

252
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:26,500
and wait for Matt to come to his senses.

253
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,126
Fisk is out, and he has to be stopped.

254
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,506
Fran was wrong.

255
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,884
I guess she didn't poke hard enough.

256
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,655
Sorry again for the wait.

257
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,872
But, good news, it's not dislocated.

258
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,250
Great. So I can go?

259
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,918
Almost done.

260
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,379
Honestly, this paper
work is a waste of time.

261
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,798
It just ends up in a file somewhere.

262
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:22,179
I am now going to check your pupils
to make sure you're not concussed.

263
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,056
- Just look up for a minute.
- No, just...

264
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,725
Give me the paper work, please.

265
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,102
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

266
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,355
I forgot to mention...

267
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,316
if you come down with any
headaches the next couple of days,

268
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,568
make sure that you...

269
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,053
Come on.

270
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,515
God damn it.

271
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,248
You're not Franklin Nelson.

272
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,126
Fisk.

273
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,713
It's quite something to see.

274
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:42,802
For a blind man, you have very
impressive reflexes, Mr. Murdock.

275
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,180
What was I injected with?

276
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,684
Do you remember the
last time that we spoke?

277
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:57,191
You said that, for the cost of
postage, you could prevent my reunion

278
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,152
with the only person who
gives my life meaning.

279
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,072
The only person that I love.

280
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,160
And I would've let bygones be bygones.

281
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,959
But you didn't just threaten me...

282
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,090
you threatened Vanessa.

283
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:27,596
And that is something
that I cannot forgive.

284
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,390
Listen to me very carefully.

285
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,083
Is that him?

286
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,921
Where'd he go?

287
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,575
Hey. Come here. Come
on. Let me outta here.

288
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,535
Where you going? Hey, come back.

289
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,870
Hey, come back, man.

290
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,541
On the ground!

291
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,209
Hold on. I was attacked.

292
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,733
- Get on the ground now!
- I was attacked. I need help.

293
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,214
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Okay.

294
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,591
All right, we got him.

295
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,134
We'll take care of him.

296
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:23,082
Hey, nice job, homes.
Grab his keys, quick.

297
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,589
Code 33, code 33...

298
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,674
Lockdown is now in effect.

299
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,803
Code 33, code 33...

300
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,765
Lockdown is now in effect.

301
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,937
Light it up, Vic!

302
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:50,234
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

303
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,237
Lockdown is now in effect.

304
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,241
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

305
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,202
Lockdown is now in effect.

306
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,592
Fisk betrays everyone!

307
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:19,388
He will turn on you. Fisk
will turn on you, too.

308
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,599
Who are you? And why
does Fisk want you dead?

309
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,774
Hey, wait...

310
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,734
What is that? Albanian?

311
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,904
- Are you Vic?
- You're an idiot coming here.

312
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,115
Fisk still controls half
the guards and prisoners.

313
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,701
Yeah, but not... not the Albanians.

314
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,912
Not since Fisk ratted
your people out to the FBI.

315
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,880
What's it to you?

316
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,385
Fisk hates me as much
as he hates you people.

317
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,847
I helped get him locked up.
And I'm gonna do it again.

318
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,349
Nah, I think you're gonna die in here.

319
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,937
Why did Fisk flip on your people?

320
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,272
It doesn't matter.

321
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,025
It matters enough that
you're desperate to kill him.

322
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,570
You missed him in here, and then
you tried again on the outside.

323
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,407
That is a very serious allegation.

324
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,992
And wrong.

325
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,828
We never tried to hit him... in here.

326
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,915
Fisk was shanked in the weight room.

327
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,793
- Not by us.
- Oh, yeah? If not you, then who?

328
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:41,428
Listen, if I succeed, Fisk
ends up right back here

329
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,472
with you and your men.

330
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,184
And after that, you can do
with him whatever you please.

331
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,652
Fisk shanked Fisk.

332
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,862
He bribed some lifer to stab him.

333
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,033
He set the whole thing up?

334
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,078
The guy sliced him up just good
enough to convince the feds.

335
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,411
Of course.

336
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,375
This guy, he's a lifer?

337
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,544
If he was bribed, does
that mean he's still alive?

338
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,089
Better than alive. Free.

339
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,968
Free? How is he not in solitary?

340
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,012
Fisk got someone to cook
the books and let him out.

341
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,308
Okay, there are guards coming.

342
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,810
Give me the lifer's name.

343
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,980
He's the only proof we have that
Fisk set this whole thing up.

344
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,791
- So what?
- So if I can get to him, I can...

345
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,442
- You can barely get to your feet.
- Vic, please.

346
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,113
You took a shot at Fisk, and you missed.

347
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,197
I won't.

348
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,741
Not if you can get me out of here.

349
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,412
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

350
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,123
Lockdown is now in effect.

351
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,167
Drag that guard in here.

352
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,849
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

353
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,645
Blood was lost during
the motorcade attack.

354
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,148
My baby cousin's blood.

355
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,277
Find the inmate who shanked
Fisk. Make good on your word.

356
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,737
Or we'll come find ya.

357
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,656
His name?

358
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,284
Jasper Evans.

359
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,662
Get him outta here.

360
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,998
Wait, hold on a second.

361
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,124
There's two guards.

362
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,210
Okay, now.

363
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,690
- This way.
- There's an exit this way.

364
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,924
There are two guards. Trust me, please.

365
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,594
Lockdown is now in effect.

366
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,723
We need to go through this
door on the left. Here.

367
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,807
It's locked.

368
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,810
There's a key in your top left pocket.

369
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,315
Toward the exit! The other way!

370
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,399
Hurry.

371
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,443
There he is!

372
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,570
Move! Now!

373
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,905
Get him! Go!

374
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,878
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

375
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,671
The other way. The other way.

376
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,010
Slow down. Thank you. Thank you.

377
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,182
Inmate! On your knees!

378
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,261
Lockdown is now in effect.

379
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,282
- I can't see.
- Left. Left.

380
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,850
Now take a right. Sharp right.

381
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,187
I got a civilian here! Get him out. Go.

382
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,232
Go! Go!

383
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,876
Open the gate! Open the gate!

384
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,627
Open the gate!

385
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,405
Drive. Drive.

386
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,532
Drive.

387
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,244
Drive.

388
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,497
If I'm being honest,

389
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,639
that's not the way I
thought this was gonna go.

390
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,393
Who eats a burger with a spork?

391
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,985
- Special Agent Poindexter.
- Ma'am.

392
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,071
This is Supervisory
Special Agent Winn with OPR.

393
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,489
Poindexter.

394
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,950
Why don't you go grab a cup of coffee?

395
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,828
Yes, sir.

396
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:35,925
Dex.

397
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,847
- Don't sweat this.
- Sweat what, exactly?

398
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,934
OPR wants a private interview with Fisk.

399
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,355
And I'm the only one
asked to leave the room.

400
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,900
It would be inappropriate of me

401
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,486
to tell you that the Office
of Professional Responsibility

402
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,864
has launched an internal investigation
into the motorcade attack.

403
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,576
It would also be inappropriate of me

404
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,828
to tell you that there
was a slight discrepancy

405
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,791
between your official report and the
forensic analysis of the shooting.

406
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,336
Yeah, it would be inappropriate
for you to tell me all this.

407
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,094
Because of you, my wife
still has her husband...

408
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,055
and my son still has his father.

409
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,430
Detective!

410
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,519
The hell are you doing here?
This is a union-only function.

411
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,688
You know what I love about our dynamic?

412
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,273
We skip the pleasantries.

413
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,151
No hellos. No how-you-beens.
Straight to business.

414
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,112
I'm about to get to the business
of dragging your ass up outta here.

415
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,740
I wouldn't have intruded
if it wasn't important.

416
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,992
Let me guess. You need a favor.

417
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:25,535
See?

418
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,538
Do you have this kind of
shorthand with anyone else?

419
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,207
Wilson Fisk.

420
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,961
His cushy new situation

421
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,631
is a federally-funded slap in the
face to every officer in this room.

422
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:39,924
No shit.

423
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,927
Not sure what that has to do with
you crashing this party, though.

424
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,765
I want to say a few words,
express my solidarity.

425
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,933
And it would play better
if you gave me the floor.

426
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,895
- Just to say a few things.
- It's been a long week, Foggy, okay?

427
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,897
And you talking is
only gonna drag it out.

428
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,440
Now, it's time to go.

429
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,984
In handcuffs or on your own.

430
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,071
Say no more.

431
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,911
Hey, Brett, how's it going?

432
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,673
Excuse me, esteemed constables.

433
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,427
Guys, could I have...

434
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:28,097
Hey, Counselor, I
personally wanna thank you

435
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,851
for springing my arson perp
out of jail on a technicality.

436
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,313
Come on. There were mitigating
circumstances, and you know it, Officer.

437
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,676
His building was not up to code.

438
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,442
Let me show you where to stick
your mitigating circumstances.

439
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,612
Hey, hey, hey, people, look, um...

440
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:47,742
Nelson's all right. He helped
the city put Fisk behind bars.

441
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,993
Give him a minute.

442
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,120
One minute.

443
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,628
Officers, I don't mean to disappoint.

444
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,423
But I'm not here to talk
only about Wilson Fisk.

445
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,467
With his name on everyone's lips,

446
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:09,514
he's getting far more publicity
than any cop killer deserves.

447
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,224
His name deserves to be buried...

448
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:15,937
buried in the same hard earth
where he put your fallen brothers.

449
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,732
I'm here to talk about Blake Tower...

450
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,527
our honorable district attorney.

451
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,060
Here's a man charged with ensuring

452
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:27,950
the safety of this
city, just as you are.

453
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,411
And yet, he stands idly by

454
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,289
while the feds whisk
that monster out of prison

455
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,291
and into the warm lap of luxury.

456
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,334
Someone smarter than me...

457
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,837
That's a pretty freakin'
low bar, isn't it?

458
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,050
That man said, "The only thing
necessary for the triumph of evil

459
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,219
is for good men to do nothing."

460
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,308
Blake Tower is a good man doing nothing.

461
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,610
Which is why I'm running my own

462
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:59,314
write-in campaign for district attorney,

463
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,991
to oust Blake Tower
and to put Wilson Fisk

464
00:40:01,992 --> 00:40:04,570
into the deepest prison hole allowable

465
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,279
under the Eighth Amendment.

466
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,657
And I would love nothing
more than to do that

467
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:13,453
with the endorsement of each of
you and your illustrious union.

468
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,006
All right, where do I sign up?

469
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,574
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

470
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,451
Hey, what's up, yo?

471
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,371
Look at shorty comin'.

472
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,958
Hey, hey, let me get your name.

473
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,977
- Let's go around.
- What we getting into?

474
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,337
What's up, y'all? Let me get your names.

475
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,299
Come on! What we getting into tonight?

476
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,677
Where you going, Ma? We got all night!

477
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,930
See, that ass is walking away, bro.

478
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,267
Yo, that's all you,
bro. That's all you, bro.

479
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,645
Now, this is a real lady.

480
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,272
Come here. You coming to say hi?

481
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,985
We could have some fun
tonight. Yeah, you like fun?

482
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,695
Get out of my way.

483
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,865
You got bite. Come on, play with us.

484
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,077
Let's play a game.

485
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,791
What do you wanna play? The one
where I play scared little girl?

486
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,434
'Cause it seems you like scaring girls.

487
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,336
It's all good. We was just having fun.

488
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,339
Let's have fun. Huh?
Who goes first? You? Me?

489
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,384
Lady, we were just being friendly.

490
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,302
Then this is just a friendly reminder

491
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,722
that games like that can
get your head blown off.

492
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,974
Why are you still here?

493
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,291
Trouble at home?

494
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,835
Um, no, I...

495
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,379
Actually, that's none of my business.

496
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:35,136
No, no. Um... I could
use some help, advice.

497
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,472
I don't know.

498
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,018
You've taken fire before, right?

499
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,186
Enough.

500
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,730
You have kids at the time?

501
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,442
Your boy having trouble
with the shooting?

502
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,361
Yeah.

503
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:57,283
Yeah, he's, uh, not sleeping,
you know... watching the news.

504
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,911
Stuff like that.

505
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,500
I mean, I think the best thing
to do is talk to him like a man.

506
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,877
Tell him that the job I
do is dangerous, but I...

507
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,296
My advice... don't.

508
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,090
I tried that with my daughter.

509
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,633
It freaked her out so bad,

510
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,219
she wouldn't let me leave
the house in the morning.

511
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,889
She lay across the door and cried
until I called in and took the day.

512
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,892
Treat your son like a CI.

513
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,605
Make my kid my snitch?

514
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,066
Snitch lives in a scary
world they don't control,

515
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,485
and they depend on you to keep 'em safe.

516
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,611
Sound familiar?

517
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,406
Yeah, but lying to my son...

518
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,618
My dad was a trucker.

519
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,954
He mostly hauled chemical tankers.

520
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,916
He'd bring 'em to the house overnight
before heading out sometimes.

521
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,253
And I'd have nightmares,
thinking about what could happen.

522
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,839
But when my dad found out,

523
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,761
he showed me a diamond-shaped
decal on the back

524
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:57,093
with the colors and numbers.

525
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,304
He told me the numbers tell you
how high the level of danger is.

526
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,141
He only hauled level four, safest stuff.

527
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,768
Once I knew that, it didn't
seem so scary anymore.

528
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,566
- Level four is the most lethal code.
- But I didn't know that.

529
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,915
And I didn't worry when he drove off

530
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,111
every morning in a rolling fire bomb.

531
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,031
The lies that keep us safe
are the ones worth telling.

532
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,040
Coming?

533
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:14,045
Ms. Page? What are you doing here?

534
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,880
I know we had an
appointment for tomorrow,

535
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,003
but what we have to talk
about can't wait till then.

536
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,050
This is my home.

537
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,893
- My family is upstairs.
- I know. I'm sorry.

538
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,346
You're lucky I'm willing
to talk to you, period.

539
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,806
If my bosses at the FDIC
found out I was talking...

540
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,475
Red Lion National Bank.

541
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:31,187
And how the hell did you get my address?

542
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,832
- Did Ellison put you up...
- No. Ellison doesn't know that I'm here.

543
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,496
He doesn't know that I reached out
to you. I know that looks bad...

544
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,325
And if you did, you
wouldn't be standing here.

545
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:41,155
The sooner you tell me about
Red Lion, the sooner I go.

546
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,450
Wilson Fisk is laundering
his money through that bank.

547
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,952
We're talking millions of dollars.

548
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,746
- Honey, who's at the door?
- Someone from work.

549
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,957
The FDIC has to be
monitoring a bank involved...

550
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
We're done here.

551
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,417
Hey! No, I just...

552
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,253
I need proof.

553
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,089
Give me a contact at the bank.

554
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,299
I'll be having words with
Ellison in the morning.

555
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,177
Give me a name, you
will never see me again.

556
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,304
Honey, what's going on?

557
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,685
There's only one name
worth checking into, and...

558
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,770
good luck squeezing anything out of him.

559
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,438
Who?

560
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,148
Felix Manning.

561
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,610
Thank you.

562
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,697
Thank me by getting the
hell off my property.

563
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,158
Sorry.

564
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,003
I thought you were relieved for the day.

565
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,839
- Is everyone gone?
- Yeah.

566
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,509
Good. Yeah, that's good.

567
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,265
Why don't you go downstairs,
grab a cup of coffee?

568
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,891
My treat.

569
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:54,562
Yeah.

570
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,814
That's a good idea.

571
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,609
I'll just...

572
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,363
Yeah.

573
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,580
Do you remember these men?

574
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,958
They were among the Albanians
who attacked the motorcade.

575
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,878
- Did you see these men die?
- Yes, I did.

576
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,838
And did you see who shot them?

577
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,968
There was only one FBI
agent left standing.

578
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,054
Special Agent Poindexter.

579
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,972
The moment he shot them,

580
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,517
can you describe, for
the record, what you saw?

581
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,820
They were armed.

582
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,283
Special Agent Poindexter gave
them a chance to surrender,

583
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,619
but then their weapons
came up to shoot him.

584
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,124
He killed them both in self-defense.

585
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,839
Thank you for your time, Mr. Fisk.

586
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,557
- What's your game?
- Game?

587
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,393
I don't need any favors
from you, convict.

588
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,229
Favors, no.

589
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,273
But sympathy...

590
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,819
Papers, protests...

591
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,905
the mockery.

592
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,577
I can carry this burden
of humiliation, but you?

593
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,787
You're a dedicated federal agent.

594
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,376
You don't know anything about me.

595
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,214
Neither does the Bulletin.

596
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:15,221
The press is labeling the attack
on my life as an FBI disaster.

597
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,266
And now they're investigating
you for doing your job.

598
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,852
They're questioning you
for your exceptionalism.

599
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,521
You saved my life!

600
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,441
And the lives of
honorable federal agents.

601
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,693
Did they report that?

602
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:30,778
No.

603
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,990
Instead, they vilify...

604
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,577
and demean your act of courage.

605
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,807
The world is changing.

606
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,772
The real heroes are
ridiculed and dismissed.

607
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,820
And for that, I offer my sympathy.

608
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,715
Where are we?

609
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:35,426
Where...

610
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,974
Wait... Hey, hold up. Stop the car.

611
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,934
No problem. We'll get you home.

612
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,729
Who are you?

613
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,067
Hey! Hey!

614
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,865
No, no, no. No.

615
