00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,787
Sir.

3
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,039
- What?
- Nadeem escaped.

4
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,290
He's in the wind.

5
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,961
Then find him!

6
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,983
Hello, Wilson.

7
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,009
Okay. There's nobody watching.

8
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,478
Straight up there, please.

9
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,607
Nice and easy. No rush.

10
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,442
Go.

11
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,574
Thanks, Mrs. Mahoney.

12
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,201
Y'all ain't the only ones
haunted by Wilson Fisk.

13
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,204
Thank you, dear.

14
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,502
Uh, fresh sheets on the
bed. Towels if you need.

15
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,303
Uh... Thank you. Really.

16
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,723
And don't worry. Nobody
knows you're here.

17
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,604
Seema, if you...

18
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,274
You promised you would
never lie to me again.

19
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,947
Seems, if you understood
what was going on here...

20
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,241
Do you know why I married you, Ray?

21
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,163
It wasn't your good looks
or my father's blessing.

22
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,666
It was because I believed in my soul

23
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,210
that I had found a good
man who would love me.

24
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,254
And who would be
completely honest with me.

25
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,631
Seems, I do love you...

26
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,717
You lied again and again.

27
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,179
And now here we are, running.

28
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,723
Hiding in some lady's house.

29
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,102
Fisk played me. Okay?
And before I knew it...

30
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,187
You brought a gunfight to our home!

31
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,525
You're right.

32
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,736
About everything.

33
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,117
But I will fix it.

34
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,280
Sami was curled up with me in a bathtub,

35
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:26,665
waiting for men to come kill him.

36
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,594
Do you know what I
hoped for in that moment?

37
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,213
That they'd kill him first, so
he didn't have to watch me die.

38
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,257
How do you fix that?

39
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,759
Seems, Seems...

40
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,346
I am so sorry.

41
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,018
But I will make you and Sami safe.

42
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,147
I promise you.

43
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,526
I can't let what you say
matter to me anymore, Rahul.

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,780
Sami deserves at least one
person in his life he can trust.

45
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,992
And that's never going to be you.

46
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,888
Mahoney really stepped
up for us. Mrs. M, too.

47
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,806
Everyone in the
neighborhood wants Fisk gone.

48
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,893
Foggy, you don't need to
talk me into this anymore.

49
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,061
I promised we'd do it
your way, and we are.

50
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,897
Good. 'Cause it's gonna work.

51
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,565
Good. I hope you're right.

52
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,653
Are we clear?

53
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,870
So, what now?

54
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,357
You're going to testify against Fisk,

55
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:51,708
once you hire us to represent you.

56
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,669
Represent me?

57
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,547
As Nelson and Murdock, attorneys at law.

58
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,854
Three restaurants, the
best spa in the city...

59
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,775
a full staff waiting to
fulfill our every need,

60
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,985
It's all ours.

61
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,945
"Ours"?

62
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,739
You bought it?

63
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,823
For you.

64
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,660
There's a penthouse with
the best view of the city.

65
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,246
Our city.

66
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,086
It's everything you've ever wanted.

67
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,982
- Sir, uh...
- Not now.

68
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,277
- It's important.
- Not now.

69
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,659
Good night.

70
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,721
Can I get you something?

71
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,057
Champagne?

72
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,353
Not now, thank you.

73
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,118
I don't have your eye...

74
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,249
but I hung them where I
guessed you would like them.

75
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:25,463
We can move them or... buy
other ones, whatever you like.

76
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,346
I thought that you might
want to curate a collection

77
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,890
and display it throughout the hotel.

78
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,281
Thank you.

79
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,700
This is all so generous.

80
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,037
It's nothing. I wanted
you to feel welcome.

81
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
I do.

82
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,041
It's...

83
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,836
incredible.

84
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,965
Do you want something to eat
from one of the restaurants,

85
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,884
or I could make you something?

86
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,471
I'm not hungry... just tired.

87
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,057
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,976
You've gone through so much trouble.

89
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,394
No, no. Please. I...

90
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,065
You had a long trip. I should have...

91
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,486
I should have realized that
this could be overwhelming.

92
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,945
It's sweet...

93
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:36,034
but all I want right now is
a hot bath and a soft bed.

94
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,499
The master suite is
upstairs. I'll show you.

95
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,625
No need.

96
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:45,835
I'll find it.

97
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,821
This is your law office?

98
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,615
Nobody knows about this place.
We'll be safe here. Take a seat.

99
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,872
Ms. Page.

100
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,332
Agent Nadeem.

101
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,296
You tried to warn me about Fisk.

102
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,091
I should have listened.

103
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,388
- And about what happened at the church...
- Let's not... Let's not go there.

104
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,792
In the end, you got me out alive,

105
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,143
so I guess that means
we're on the same side now.

106
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,230
Yeah. I guess it does.

107
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,061
All right. We're gonna
get your family safe, Ray,

108
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:50,525
but we can't ask for WITSEC.

109
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,444
If Fisk got to the Bureau, he
can get to the Marshals Service.

110
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,532
We were thinking overseas. Maybe
with a friend or a distant relative.

111
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,075
Uh...

112
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,911
my brother's wife has a cousin in Bihar.

113
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,998
- I never liked him.
- Oh, I can get 'em a flight.

114
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,961
But Fisk's people will
be watching the airports,

115
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
so we should fly 'em out of Montreal.

116
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,383
Um, I've had some time to think
about how to get away from him.

117
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,439
They'll be watching my bank accounts.

118
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,469
We'll cover it.

119
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,185
Thanks.

120
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,688
But it might be more than I deserve.

121
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,403
Look, you... you hurt people.

122
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,573
It doesn't have to define you.

123
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,912
You should get ready, Ray.

124
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,872
Locker room is through there.

125
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,459
Yeah.

126
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,931
You're right. His mistakes
don't need to define him.

127
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,016
Neither do yours.

128
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,438
I should get going. I
don't wanna miss my window.

129
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,028
Really? No, uh, "It's
too dangerous, Karen"?

130
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,115
Clearly, you can handle yourself.

131
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,832
But, you know, Karen,
please, be careful.

132
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,462
Got it.

133
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,657
Detective Mahoney.

134
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,534
I see you're putting
in for early retirement.

135
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,187
No, sir, Mr. District Attorney.

136
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:08,371
There's someone who
needs to talk to you.

137
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,957
Oh, hell.

138
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,256
You ever hear of a phone?

139
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,843
I'm as familiar with my phone as you
are with the "ignore call" button.

140
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,011
What do you want?

141
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,847
Another viral video you can
use to campaign against me?

142
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,766
I want to make you an offer
that you won't want to refuse.

143
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,769
I can't wait.

144
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,938
In exchange for an hour of your time,

145
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,482
I'll drop out of the race
and hand you the election.

146
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,318
- What's the punch line?
- No punch line.

147
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,700
I'm just asking that you sit down

148
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,155
with Matt Murdock and
me and a client of ours,

149
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,824
and just listen to what he has to say.

150
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,995
I do that, and you just drop out?

151
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,122
Uh-huh.

152
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,039
You know, I don't even pick
up a book in the airport

153
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,711
without reading the last page first?

154
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,297
I need to know what
this meeting is about.

155
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,260
- It's about Wilson Fisk.
- For the love of...

156
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,096
You need help, Nelson.
Get the hell out of my car.

157
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,639
Fisk is threatening my family.

158
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,435
He got them dirty, and now he's
using them as leverage against me.

159
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,818
So if you win the election...

160
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,615
and take my job, Fisk
will control New York's DA?

161
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,493
Right.

162
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,863
So, honestly, I'm dropping out

163
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:32,789
whether you give me an
hour of your time or not.

164
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,626
But I'm asking you to anyway.

165
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,920
You'll withdraw publicly?

166
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,880
And endorse you.

167
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,467
Throw in an extra 15 minutes,
I'll even vote for you.

168
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,098
You ready for this?

169
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,225
Testifying is not gonna be easy.

170
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,646
I loved my job.

171
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,108
And I loved being the good guy.

172
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,446
I want to be on the right
side of the line again.

173
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,659
You didn't love it enough to stop Fisk.

174
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,541
Fisk knows how to
make people vulnerable.

175
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,212
He got my sister-in-law's
health insurance canceled,

176
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,548
left my family with bills to
pay. Bills that I had to...

177
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,134
So you take a loan, you sell
your house, you figure it out.

178
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,097
You don't allow yourself
to become an accessory.

179
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,114
- It wasn't that easy...
- You backed his play, Ray.

180
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,408
You moved him into his hotel,
even gave him his toys back.

181
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,112
He was giving information
that saved lives.

182
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,578
While he was taking lives. While
he was taking over the city!

183
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,883
What the hell are you doing?
I thought you were my lawyer!

184
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,795
I am your lawyer, but I can't help you

185
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:42,258
if you can't answer
this one simple question.

186
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,464
Why didn't you blow the whistle

187
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:45,611
when you watched your
boss murder an agent?

188
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,571
I don't know.

189
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,323
Or when you saw Dex walk in that church?

190
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,410
You didn't say a goddamn word
when he murdered a priest.

191
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,053
- I don't know.
- Then why are we here?!

192
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,997
Because I took the damn bait!

193
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,143
Because I didn't want my son to see me

194
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:07,258
as just an average federal employee.

195
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,598
I messed up.

196
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,477
I destroyed my life.

197
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,814
My family's life.

198
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,155
And I would do anything
to take it all back again.

199
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,782
Good.

200
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,203
You tell that to the
DA, and I can help you.

201
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,590
Blake Tower, FBI
Special Agent Ray Nadeem.

202
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,883
We've met.

203
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,135
Before we begin, some ground rules.

204
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,055
Our client will speak to you
under terms of use immunity.

205
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,015
He does not waive his
Fifth Amendment rights.

206
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,769
Special Agent, I should advise
you that Misters Nelson and Murdock

207
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,292
have their own agendas in this case.

208
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,190
Conflicts of interest are not
something you want in legal counsel.

209
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,611
I trust them.

210
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,530
Suit yourself.

211
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,784
Mr. Nelson played his biggest
and last card to get me here.

212
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,037
So, what are you going to tell me?

213
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,791
He's going to tell you that Wilson
Fisk has had people murdered,

214
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,918
blackmailed federal law
enforcement personnel,

215
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,721
and is currently taxing
New York's criminals

216
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,755
in exchange for protection
from prosecution.

217
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,882
And your client has personally
witnessed these acts?

218
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,426
He did. And he's prepared to testify.

219
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,013
Now, before I agree to that,

220
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,975
Agent Nadeem, why are
you coming forward now?

221
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,897
I hurt people.

222
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,192
My pride hurt people.

223
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,113
And I need to make that right again.

224
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,991
Okay.

225
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,370
I accept the terms of use immunity.

226
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,956
Tell me what you know.

227
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,565
Can I get you anything else, sir?

228
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,782
I just wanted to say I'm
sorry about Karen Page.

229
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,037
She would be dead if Agent
Nadeem hadn't interfered.

230
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,419
After everything
you've done for me, I...

231
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,549
I just wanted to tell you
that I'll keep my word.

232
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,052
I will find her, and
when I do, I am going...

233
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,345
No.

234
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,222
This matter will be
handled, but not by you.

235
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,392
- I can handle Agent Nadeem.
- Do nothing.

236
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,230
It's clear that I have put too
great a burden on your shoulders.

237
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,704
After the attack on my home...

238
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,875
I secured my family
and came directly here.

239
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,255
- This is unbelievable.
- Believe it.

240
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,968
I can convene a special grand jury today.
Probably by 4 p.m.

241
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,804
Great. Our offer is straightforward.

242
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,556
Agent Nadeem's testimony in
exchange for full immunity.

243
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,648
He just confessed to being an
accessory in how many homicides?

244
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,983
Cases you would never
make in a million years

245
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,318
without our client's testimony.

246
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,405
If this was a larceny
case, or corruption, maybe.

247
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,991
But he's a federal law enforcement
officer that looked the other way

248
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,703
while class A felonies,
homicides, were committed.

249
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,872
Two men were murdered in front of
him, and he never said a damn word.

250
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,309
He didn't say a thing, because
he was afraid for his family.

251
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,893
Fisk tried to kill them all last night,

252
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,879
and Agent Nadeem is here
today, telling you everything.

253
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,257
Can you say you'd do the
same thing, Mr. Tower?

254
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,677
Our offer expires when
you walk out that door.

255
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,763
Full immunity, or we're advising
our client to run for his life.

256
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,767
Five years.

257
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,270
- On each count.
- No.

258
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,023
- You can't do murder and walk.
- Come on, Blake, no jail time.

259
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,484
You'll be the DA who
took down Wilson Fisk,

260
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,487
and the next stop on the Tower
train is the governorship.

261
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,202
Five years, on all counts.

262
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,370
Final offer.

263
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,081
Thank you for coming by, Mr. Tower.

264
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,464
Wait.

265
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,633
He's right.

266
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,969
I did the crime.

267
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,850
And I need to keep my family safe.

268
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,562
I'll take it.

269
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,525
It's okay.

270
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,487
I'm good with this.

271
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,491
Let me make a call.

272
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,499
Sami, there's something I
need to talk to you about.

273
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:38,130
You might hear some stories
about me, some stuff that...

274
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,217
sounds like I did bad things.

275
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,306
No, I didn't do them.

276
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,894
But I didn't stop them
from happening, either.

277
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,148
And that's just as bad.

278
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,610
I was trying to keep
you and your mom safe.

279
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,489
That's all that matters to me.

280
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,034
I don't care what people say about me,

281
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:12,623
all I care about is...
what you say about me,

282
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,126
and that you get to live
the life that you want.

283
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:17,962
I love you, kid.

284
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,089
Hey. Feels good, right?

285
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,425
What? Letting Ray serve five years?

286
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,387
Any other lawyers, he would've
gone away a lot longer.

287
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,641
But I meant working
together, you and me.

288
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,075
Doing what we're supposed to be doing

289
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:34,562
the way we're supposed to be doing it.

290
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,273
Yeah... it felt good.

291
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,607
Right?

292
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,653
I miss this, working together,
giving a shit about my clients.

293
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,073
Not just billing midtown
jackholes in six-minute increments.

294
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,534
Those jackholes pay well, though, huh?

295
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,202
What, are those new shoes?

296
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,080
Seems like you got used
to the money, Nelson.

297
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,582
So I'll get unused to it.

298
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,292
We should do this again.

299
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,335
Don't get ahead of yourself.
We're not there yet.

300
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,628
But we're getting there.

301
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,702
Vanessa.

302
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,497
I'm sorry, I overslept.
Long flights do me in.

303
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,752
I heard the shower. I
thought you might be famished.

304
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,172
- My favorite.
- Yes, I remember.

305
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:54,892
More salt?

306
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,685
It's perfect.

307
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,455
Vanessa, something's bothering you.

308
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,417
Please tell me what it is.

309
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,843
While I was away, I was always
surrounded by your bodyguards.

310
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,308
"How are you, Ms. Marianna?"

311
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,687
"How is your day going, Ms. Marianna?"

312
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,022
I was always "fine."

313
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,402
The day was always "nice."

314
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:52,491
One day, I, um, found myself
on the Nervión River in Bilbao.

315
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,743
Hundreds of people...

316
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,956
Tourists posed for
pictures, held hands...

317
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,876
kissed on the riverfront.

318
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,839
I was surrounded by people...

319
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,176
but I wasn't with them.

320
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,013
I was lonely.

321
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,560
Vanessa, we have both been lonely.

322
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,311
And I still am.

323
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:29,278
I'm here, surrounded by your
things, your people, even you...

324
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,451
but I still don't
feel that I'm with you.

325
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,122
What can I do?

326
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,459
I'll do anything. Please, tell me.

327
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:51,842
I am sorry to bother you, sir,
but I'm afraid this cannot wait.

328
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,053
Not here.

329
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,392
I have to...

330
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,190
Forgive me, please.

331
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,525
Of course.

332
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,413
Never in front of Vanessa.

333
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,625
Tell me.

334
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,212
Agent Nadeem has not yet been located.

335
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,797
But my source tells me

336
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,717
that the state's grand jury that
was to be released this morning

337
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,260
has been held late.

338
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:39,848
What's more, courthouse security
has been dramatically increased.

339
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,558
These could be indications...

340
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,811
Nadeem is intending to testify.

341
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,398
That could be problematic.

342
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,442
Yes, it would, sir.

343
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,196
What's unclear to me is
how you failed to kill him!

344
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,783
Daredevil interfered.

345
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,203
The men responsible
have been eliminated.

346
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:05,499
However, the ultimate
responsibility does rest with me.

347
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:10,462
If you would like my
resignation, I understand.

348
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,052
You protected her...

349
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,764
two years.

350
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,352
You kept Vanessa safe when I couldn't.

351
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,982
No, Felix. I want you to finish the job.

352
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:39,032
If you need assistance,
call our friends.

353
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,582
Do whatever it takes.

354
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,169
I will not be indicted.

355
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,256
Hey, Tommy, I'll have two...

356
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,426
Two knishes with extra
sauerkraut and extra mustard.

357
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,054
It's 11:40.

358
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:02,848
You're a creature of habit.

359
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,232
This totally doesn't mean
that I forgive you, by the way.

360
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,169
- I'm trying to keep a low profile.
- I'm sorry.

361
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,069
You-know-who's people
are looking for me, so...

362
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,713
Well, after what happened at the church,

363
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,199
so is every FBI agent
and reporter in the city.

364
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,951
Uh, your knishes?

365
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,953
Oh! Uh, here.

366
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,084
So, um... are we doing this?

367
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:36,215
If by "this" you mean I tell
you who Daredevil is, then no.

368
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,677
What I can tell you is who attacked
the Bulletin in Daredevil's suit.

369
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,845
Do you have a name?

370
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,847
Ben Poindexter.

371
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,141
The FBI agent who saved Fisk.

372
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,227
Yeah, well, apparently
he made a good impression,

373
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,630
because he's working for him now.

374
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,105
- And you can prove this how?
- I don't have to.

375
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,483
In a couple of hours, the
head of Fisk's FBI detail

376
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,152
is going to testify to everything
in front of a grand jury.

377
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,363
Ray Nadeem is going to
turn state's witness.

378
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,366
- Wow.
- Yeah.

379
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,409
It's a hell of an
exclusive. Welcome back.

380
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,454
No, see, actually, it's
not gonna be an exclusive.

381
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:12,042
Come on, Ellison, this is... This
is bigger than just our newspaper.

382
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,170
When Fisk had our offices attacked,
he was trying to silence the truth.

383
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,716
God help me.

384
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,054
Okay, so what is it, exactly,
that you want me to do?

385
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,139
I need you to call a press conference.

386
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:31,728
Just tell everyone that Karen
Page wants to make a statement.

387
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,663
This is from Wilson.

388
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,543
I was wondering where it had gone.

389
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,254
Hey, we haven't formally met yet.

390
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,173
I'm Agent Poindexter.

391
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,717
Dex.

392
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:07,973
If you need anything at all, just
think of me as the new James Wesley.

393
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,975
Pleasure to meet you.

394
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,852
Vanessa Marianna.

395
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:21,236
I've always told Wilson
he has great taste in art.

396
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,992
He does love to put
beautiful things on display.

397
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,996
Where did you find it?

398
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,292
Some lady had it. Wilson
couldn't get her to sell it.

399
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,920
Well, that must have been
very disappointing for him.

400
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,050
It's the painting in his collection
that means the most to us.

401
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,302
I figured that...

402
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:49,097
so I thought I'd ask
her just one last time.

403
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,527
Thank you, Agent Poindexter.

404
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,656
Perhaps you can arrange
to have it hung for us?

405
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,495
It'd be my pleasure, ma'am.

406
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,040
What about Nelson?

407
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,793
Foggy's ironing out
some details with the DA.

408
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,669
He's gonna meet us at the courthouse.

409
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,451
- Then let's get this over with.
- Not that one. This one.

410
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,550
Really?

411
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:27,969
Hey.

412
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,474
Mahoney tell you this could get rough?

413
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,602
He told me you're taking out
Fisk. That's all I need to hear.

414
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,479
Courthouse. No stops.

415
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,089
I need to ask you something.

416
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,220
You want to know about Daredevil.

417
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:17,561
I stepped off the path for a few
weeks, and it destroyed my life...

418
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:23,150
But your life, you step
on and off all the time.

419
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,821
It complicates my life, too.

420
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,950
- Trying to have it both ways.
- Does it?

421
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,245
I mean, your friends know
who you are, what you do.

422
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,913
My life almost got them killed.

423
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,748
And not for the first time.

424
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,210
I don't see how I can have it both ways.

425
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,754
But you already do.

426
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,968
I messed up, and no matter
what happens today...

427
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,889
I don't know if my
wife's ever coming back.

428
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,268
But your friends keep coming back.

429
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,396
I mean, how do you hold onto them?

430
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,776
It's not me.

431
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,404
It's them.

432
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,051
Light it up.

433
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,898
Get us out of here!

434
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,274
He's dead.

435
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,984
Draw your weapon.

436
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,779
There's a guy there.

437
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,089
I can't shoot blind. Anybody...

438
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,157
They're reloading,
Ray! Fire your weapon!

439
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,618
There.

440
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,871
Through there.

441
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,707
- You got him.
- Let's go.

442
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,793
Wait! Ray! Wait!

443
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,180
Clear!

444
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,999
- We stick together. Understand?
- I know what I'm doing.

445
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,343
- I'll get us to the courthouse.
- Stop, Ray. Listen to me.

446
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,401
You need to trust me.

447
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,029
You pretend to lead me,
but you do what I say.

448
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,825
Stay down. All right,
there's two ahead of us.

449
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,920
All right. Up ahead,
there's a way out. This way.

450
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,967
Two o'clock. Go.

451
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,912
Bus. Take the bus.

452
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,497
Wait.

453
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,585
Okay, go.

454
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,008
Sit down. Wait for my cue.

455
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,098
Hello?

456
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:45,060
Hello? What's... what's happening?

457
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,271
Hello?

458
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,440
Hello? Is anybody there?

459
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,025
Hey...

460
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,435
Let's go. It's just up ahead.

461
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,565
Oh, shit. It's a cab.

462
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,942
I think I should drive.

463
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,624
Hey. Where are they?

464
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,584
- Late. Why?
- There's been an attack.

465
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,228
People got shot a few blocks from here.

466
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,505
- Oh, shit.
- They're locking down the building.

467
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,425
- I need to call my office.
- Hey. We're here.

468
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,345
- What the hell happened?
- Fisk knows he's going to testify.

469
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,069
Are you in any condition to?

470
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,349
- Absolutely, yeah.
- Okay. Let's go.

471
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,184
Okay, here's the deal.

472
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,605
After you testify, Tower
will take you for arraignment,

473
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:12,272
- then we'll bail you out.
- What about my family?

474
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,915
Spoke with Seema. They'll be on
a flight to Delhi in the morning.

475
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,504
It's not forever. Just
until we get Fisk put away.

476
00:37:16,505 --> 00:37:18,445
And you'll get to say goodbye.

477
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,303
- I don't know how to thank you...
- Don't. Just go get Fisk.

478
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:31,291
- You all set?
- Yeah, Ellison really delivered.

479
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,792
Is it just me, or did our plan...

480
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,479
- Foggy, I'm begging you, don't say it.
- But it feels good, right?

481
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,590
The three of us working
together and saving the... Okay.

482
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,425
Look, I gotta go, okay?

483
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,928
Oh, man.

484
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,519
You do affirm that all the testimony

485
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,105
that you are about to give in
the case now before the court

486
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,941
will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth?

487
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,862
This you do affirm under the
pains and penalties of perjury?

488
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:08,995
I do.

489
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,961
- Hey.
- Hey.

490
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,713
You ready for this?

491
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,591
Uh, no.

492
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,051
Okay, come on. Let's go.

493
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,435
Hi, I'm Karen Page. I'm
here to make a statement.

494
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,479
- Why didn't Daredevil kill you?
- Let her speak.

495
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,105
We have all been lied to.

496
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,525
All right? We've been manipulated

497
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,902
by a sociopath who doesn't
care about the truth...

498
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,405
or about who he hurts or about
anyone other than himself.

499
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,194
Last night, Wilson Fisk
tried to have me killed

500
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:49,953
because I know the truth.

501
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:59,212
The man who was wearing the Daredevil
suit is not the real Daredevil.

502
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,296
He is an impostor

503
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,219
who is helping Wilson Fisk take back

504
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,758
control of New York's
criminal underworld.

505
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,882
At this moment, a grand
jury is hearing testimony...

506
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,047
- You seeing this?
- ... Fisk is involved?

507
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,723
Can you identify this
impostor? This fake Daredevil.

508
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,807
Where did he come from?

509
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,323
Who's testifying to the grand jury?

510
00:39:13,324 --> 00:39:14,648
Can you give us a name?

511
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:20,984
Okay.

512
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,236
Your client was very convincing.

513
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,530
Keep him here until
the indictment comes in.

514
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,031
Don't worry. We'll hold up our end.

515
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,034
- Good. I'm counting on it.
- Thank you, sir.

516
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,579
You okay?

517
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:38,751
For a guy who's about to send
his family away and go to prison?

518
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:39,836
Yeah, I guess so.

519
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,671
You did good, Ray.

520
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,091
You heard everything
through the wall, didn't you?

521
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,760
You know that's kind of creepy?

522
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:48,844
Oh, he knows.

523
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,180
I heard a man standing up to Fisk.

524
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,516
Your son will hear the same thing.

525
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,977
And it'll mean a lot to him.

526
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,355
I didn't know if we could get
this done today, but we did.

527
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,440
No...

528
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:01,983
you did.

529
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,860
So, thank you.

530
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,031
So, what now?

531
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,660
Hopefully, you'll serve out your
sentence in a minimum security prison.

532
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,555
Can't be sure.

533
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,997
Will I do the whole term?

534
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,625
My guess is you won't
serve the whole five.

535
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,169
Hopefully. Good
behavior, you never know.

536
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:26,466
Willie Young, 789 West 144th Street.

537
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,262
Sara Torres, 612 East 78th Street.

538
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,765
What the hell? That's my address.

539
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,224
Holy shit.

540
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,852
Tom McGuinness, 707 Lovell Ave.

541
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:41,773
I'm sorry, they made me memorize them.

542
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,400
So just take it day by
day. That's all you can...

543
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,235
Oh, no.

544
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,197
Matt? What's wrong?

545
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,741
The jurors.

546
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,494
Fisk got to them.

547
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:59,999
At this time, the grand jury has
elected not to indict Wilson Fisk,

548
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,002
but this office, under my
leadership, will pursue every lead,

549
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:06,172
every piece of evidence that
leads us to uncovering the truth,

550
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,465
wherever we may find it.

551
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,988
We'll continue to cover
this breaking news story

552
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,344
as events unfold.

553
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,846
Karen Page, this all
started with you, didn't it?

554
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,306
"Started"? What do you mean?

555
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,142
You leaked the grand jury
story, and it was all a lie.

556
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,226
No, it's not a lie.

557
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,068
Is it a desperate attempt to boost
readership for the failing Bulletin?

558
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,025
Screw you, Jerry. What's
Fisk paying you, anyway?

559
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,705
Get out of here.

560
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,071
It's not gonna end this way, Ray.

561
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,824
We're not gonna let it.

562
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,367
The system will work.

563
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:36,744
You still believe that?

564
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,330
We've been here before. We can fix this.

565
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,291
Tower will impanel another
grand jury and try again.

566
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,711
We're not done here. Right, Matt?

567
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,713
I told you this would happen.

568
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,941
- I need to know where you're going.
- Gonna find Tower.

569
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,591
Make sure he tries again.

570
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,219
Right. Good.

571
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,099
When he gets back, we'll
get you someplace safe.

572
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,978
Fisk is unstoppable.

573
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,314
My family's never going to be safe.

574
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,983
Don't talk like that, Ray.

575
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,651
I'm sorry.

576
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:14,574
No...

577
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:16,909
I'm sorry.

578
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,965
How did this get here?

579
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,011
A gift from Agent Poindexter.

580
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,055
He persuaded the owner to part with it.

581
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,100
Did he?

582
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,316
I intended for the
painting to remain with her.

583
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:55,323
He said to think of him
as the new James Wesley.

584
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,952
- Is he?
- No.

585
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,290
But he is useful.

586
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,633
Is he dangerous?

587
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,677
Nothing to be concerned about.

588
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,056
I'll handle it.

589
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,140
How?

590
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,892
- It's not important.
- It is to me.

591
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,897
I think it's time we speak plainly.

592
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:29,524
Speak honestly.

593
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,151
I'm always honest with you.

594
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:37,156
When I first met you, I was
fascinated by your strength.

595
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:43,412
Your brutality so clear to
me, even as you hid it from me.

596
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,042
I wanted to observe everything you did.

597
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,169
And as I did, I fell in love with you.

598
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,964
But this?

599
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,676
If this is all we have...

600
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,012
it will leave me lonely, Wilson.

601
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,390
As lonely as I was in Spain.

602
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,687
When you stopped your man from
speaking in front of me, I...

603
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:12,024
I was reminded that I am
not a part of your life.

604
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,321
Not fully, and so not at all.

605
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,575
And this...

606
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,997
I don't want to admire your world.

607
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,835
I want to live inside of it with you.

608
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:35,715
Vanessa, it's one thing to know my work,

609
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,426
but it's another...

610
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,221
to dirty your hands with it.

611
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,141
My hands were never clean.

612
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,935
If you truly want me...

613
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,480
share your life with me.

614
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,816
Fully.

615
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,752
Come with me, please.

616
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,335
Hey, beautiful.

617
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,129
It's me.

618
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,797
I'm home.

619
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,430
You remember our wedding vows?

620
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,269
"I love you more than life itself."

621
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,605
I still do.

622
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,986
And, Sami, your name means "elevated."

623
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,281
And that's what you did for me.

624
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,952
Made my life better in
the most unexpected ways.

625
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,914
Elevate your mom now.

626
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,815
You're watching everyone.

627
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,110
Everyone I need to.

628
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,129
An update, please, Mr. Manning.

629
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,882
And speak freely.

630
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,762
I will no longer keep
anything from Vanessa.

631
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,138
Very good, sir.

632
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,101
Agent Nadeem has been located.

633
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:19,438
His testimony to the grand jury
remains sealed and inadmissible...

634
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,899
but given its public nature,

635
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,027
we should weigh the benefits
of keeping him alive.

636
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:29,240
Force Nadeem to stand trial
for the murder of Agent Winn,

637
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:34,245
turning the FBI against him and
discrediting him in the press.

638
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,081
My thoughts exactly, sir.

639
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:43,963
Wilson, what does Agent Nadeem
know about your business?

640
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:47,550
A considerable amount.

641
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:51,637
And is he determined to find
ways to hurt you? To hurt us?

642
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,933
Yes.

643
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,645
Don't you think it would be
safer to remove the threat?

644
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,191
Yes, I do.

645
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,594
If Agent Poindexter is useful,

646
00:49:10,595 --> 00:49:13,534
perhaps he can help
us with this problem.

647
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:20,291
- You'll let him know, won't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

648
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,246
I hoped it'd be you.

649
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,832
Hi, Ray.

650
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,296
Come on inside. Let's talk.

651
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:13,761
Come on, Dex. We both know
you're a better liar than that.

652
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,827
You want a private place to kill me.

653
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:21,769
You're in a tough spot, Ray. I get that.

654
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:26,065
It sounds hard. Really hard.

655
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,445
When he's done with
you, he'll bury you, too.

656
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,282
You know that, right?

657
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,409
I'm doing fine.

658
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,205
And you would be, too, if
you hadn't opened your mouth.

659
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,876
It's not too late to
turn things around, Dex.

660
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:53,801
Fisk manipulated you, just like he
did me and Tammy and everyone else.

661
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,429
I can help you cut a deal with the DA.

662
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,684
We can take him down, you and me.

663
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:06,313
Two federal agents...
like we were before.

664
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,319
No, that's not gonna happen, Ray.

665
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,197
I'm more than a fed now.

666
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,201
I feel more myself than
I have in my whole life.

667
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,662
Fisk gave me that.

668
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:34,133
As long as I'm alive,
my family's at risk.

669
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,432
Let's go, Ray.

670
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,728
I'm not going anywhere with you, Dex.

671
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:52,693
Whatever you need to
do... you do it here.

672
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:31,815
Thanks, Brett.

673
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:33,776
Yeah, okay.

674
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,709
- Matt, please...
- No. We tried it your way.
