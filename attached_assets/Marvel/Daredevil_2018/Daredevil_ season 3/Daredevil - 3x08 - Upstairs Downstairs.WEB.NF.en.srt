2
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:17,976
Who are you?

3
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,437
I'm Daredevil.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,106
Hey, you can't be here!

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,738
Hello, Karen. It's
nice to see you again.

6
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,539
I'm Daredevil.

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,842
Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.

8
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,637
It just works better with
a North Star to guide you.

9
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,576
What if I can't find one?

10
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,724
Then you'll rely on our structure.

11
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,602
A tidy physical space.
A disciplined vocation.

12
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,146
You will build your
life on pillars of order.

13
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,821
If you'd just wake the hell up

14
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,115
instead of playing
right into Fisk's hands.

15
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,533
He's using you...

16
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,035
- Morning.
- Morning, boss.

17
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,703
... and I think you know it.

18
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,457
So let me ask you this, Agent Nadeem...

19
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,044
Who do you think is the danger here?

20
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,134
The man who attacked the
Bulletin dressed as Daredevil...

21
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,886
he's in the FBI.

22
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,266
Hello, Karen. It's
nice to see you again.

23
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,311
Hey!

24
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,980
Julie!

25
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,067
- Dex, stay away from me.
- Please, just hear me out.

26
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,278
I'm doing this in public
so you'll feel safe.

27
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,239
I'll stay right here.
I'm not coming any closer.

28
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,408
Okay.

29
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:06,747
I am so, so sorry about how
things ended the other night.

30
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,083
I'm sorry for scaring you. I
just wanted to explain myself.

31
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,670
When we worked together
at the suicide hotline,

32
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,630
I saw the way you
were with other people.

33
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,468
Patient, compassionate, and I...

34
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,888
I really need that right now.

35
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,056
My life is out of control.

36
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,643
I have no family, and I'm
about to lose my job...

37
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:29,770
Please.

38
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,190
I just want to talk.
Anywhere you choose. And...

39
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,235
if you say no, I'll understand...

40
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,738
and I'll never bother you again.

41
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,590
Agent Nadeem.

42
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,345
You're late.

43
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,388
I was early, but I needed
to be sure about you.

44
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,473
What's his name?

45
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,184
Yeah, well, I need to
be sure about you, too.

46
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,811
You have a history of hurting people.

47
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,229
I'm not handing you a federal agent

48
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,112
- if you're gonna kill him.
- I don't do that.

49
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,703
The agents you beat up the other day?

50
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:19,361
One of them is still in the hospital.

51
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,804
All of them just doing their jobs.

52
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,174
If they'd arrested me, there'd
be no one to take down Fisk.

53
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,867
If you're right about him,
taking Fisk down is our job.

54
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,160
Oh, really?

55
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,955
Because we both know where
he's sleeping these days.

56
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,082
But I understand.

57
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,460
If there's one thing we agree
on, Nadeem, it's the greater good.

58
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,129
Like house incarceration
in exchange for good intel.

59
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,383
Sometimes you and I have to
hurt one person to save another.

60
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,218
So what's his name?

61
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,265
I need your word that
you won't touch him.

62
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,517
My word can't mean anything to you.

63
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,435
But I need to hear you give it.

64
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,399
Well, I need him to testify
against Fisk, so you got it.

65
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,197
We're gonna slip into his place.

66
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,993
Look for any evidence that ties him
to the Bulletin attack or to Fisk.

67
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,204
If we find any, we leave it where it is.

68
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,249
And we set off his fire
alarm on our way out.

69
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,460
The fire department arrives, and
you circumvent a search warrant.

70
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,170
But if we don't find anything,

71
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,131
- the guy goes on with his life.
- Spit it out.

72
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,507
Who is he?

73
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,137
Special Agent Ben Poindexter.

74
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,810
A small decaf and whatever she's having.

75
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,187
I've got mine. Thanks.

76
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,273
- My regular, Richie.
- All right.

77
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:44,779
So, I don't know how to say this
without it sounding like an insult.

78
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,240
I was never actually into you.

79
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,201
Or... not the way you might
have been thinking, anyway.

80
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,537
I didn't know how to talk to you.

81
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,164
Okay.

82
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,832
I wasn't...

83
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,085
I wasn't stalking you.

84
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,924
Although, I completely see how it
could have come across that way.

85
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,510
I just... I wanted to be more like you.

86
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,265
Do you realize how
creepy that still sounds?

87
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,736
You are so good.

88
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,615
And kind. And...

89
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,284
You save lives as your job.

90
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,539
The FBI, the army before that...

91
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,709
they helped keep me on the
straight and narrow path.

92
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,297
But now, without that, it's all...

93
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,758
I'm drowning in deep water,

94
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,303
and I don't know whether I'm swimming
for the surface or the bottom.

95
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,474
Dex, you need air. Breathe.

96
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,151
See, that's... that's
what I'm talking about.

97
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,321
You help people right themselves.

98
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,615
I've seen you do it a hundred times.

99
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,936
All I'm asking, just treat me like...

100
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:16,454
someone on the other end of the line.

101
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,002
What happened at the FBI?

102
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,047
The bureau needed a scapegoat.

103
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,936
You know, what you really
need is a good therapist.

104
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,983
I had one. She died.

105
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,484
Oh, I...

106
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,654
I'm so sorry.

107
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,579
Okay. I'll help you, Dex.

108
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,916
But, please, do not make me regret this.

109
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,713
I promise. Promise I will not.

110
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,342
Excuse me.

111
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,614
Hi. Whoa!

112
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,158
- Did you get any sleep at all?
- Yeah.

113
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,241
No.

114
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,081
- You need coffee.
- Yeah.

115
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,627
You ever have one of those
days where you're just, like...

116
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,172
You break it down, step
by step? Just, uh...

117
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,010
"Put your feet on the floor,
Karen. Just get to the sink."

118
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,763
Sure.

119
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,682
Generally speaking, I don't
call myself Karen, but...

120
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,310
Actually, no, I don't do any of that.

121
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,145
How are you not at the
bottom of a bottle right now?

122
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,566
Because I have a theory.

123
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,819
Jeez. Must be a hell of a theory.

124
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,072
Fisk is giving up criminals
involved in corruption.

125
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,555
He's planning to step into the void

126
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,617
and become the sole source
of government protection

127
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,161
for all criminals in Hell's
Kitchen, maybe the city.

128
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,872
And that theory makes
you want to not drink?

129
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,918
Yes, because I also have a plan.

130
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,004
No. No, no, Foggy,
you don't have a plan.

131
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,347
Do you know what happens
when you make a plan?

132
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,982
Fisk has already thought of it,
and he's made it part of his plan.

133
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,721
Except he has no idea that
I'm onto him. He couldn't.

134
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,516
I discovered this while
looking into Marci's briefs.

135
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,600
More ways than one.

136
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,477
- Foggy.
- Sorry.

137
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,308
The point is she was prepping

138
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:48,314
for a deposition of
a corrupt IRS official

139
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,478
who was providing fraud and
money laundering services

140
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,068
- for the Albanians...
- No, stop.

141
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,779
I can't.

142
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,121
Just one more article,
Karen. That's all it'll take.

143
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,585
All right. What's this?

144
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,837
The terms of Fisk's house incarceration.

145
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,091
If he violates any of these,
zappo. He's back in prison.

146
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,093
"Zappo"? Is that a thing?

147
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,345
Number three is the key.

148
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,223
"Committing or conspiring
to commit a felony."

149
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,851
No, no, wait. What
about number six here?

150
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,785
All this stuff about
being charged with a crime

151
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,913
that predates the agreement?

152
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,315
- Number six is not the plan.
- We have a good number six.

153
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,943
I mean, Fisk killed his
father. That's murder.

154
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,208
There's no statute of limitations.

155
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:36,990
And his mother told Ben Urich about it.

156
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,907
A dead woman told a dead guy something.

157
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,452
- That's not proof. It won't stick.
- Yeah.

158
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,622
You know what will?
Publicizing my theory.

159
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,999
So the FBI sees that Fisk
has violated his agreement,

160
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,722
they're forced to put
him back in prison?

161
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,254
And they can't ignore it if we
splash it across the front page.

162
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,589
And by "we," I mean you.

163
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,425
The Bulletin won't just let a
journalist make unsubstantiated claims.

164
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,509
That's not news.

165
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,929
But it is news if a candidate
running for district attorney

166
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,555
makes unsubstantiated claims.

167
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,017
In a public forum.
Debating the incumbent DA.

168
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,311
You're gonna debate Blake Tower?

169
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,729
At the Hell's Kitchen Club.

170
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,315
Well, it's supposed
to be prepared remarks.

171
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,192
- Huh.
- They're endorsing him.

172
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,818
I'm not actually on the agenda,

173
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,154
but Nelson's Meats is a
member of the club, so...

174
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,156
You're just gonna confront
him, out of the blue?

175
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,742
Why not? I'll catch him
when he's not expecting it.

176
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,118
Throw this stuff at him...

177
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,205
Yeah, you get him worked
up, emotional. Provoke him.

178
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,832
It could work.

179
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,753
Yup.

180
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,172
So, you'll cover the meeting?

181
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,300
Yeah, I would. I just, um...

182
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,554
I lost my job. So...

183
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,640
What?

184
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,978
Ellison loves you like
family. What did you do?

185
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,399
I refused to give him
Daredevil's identity.

186
00:12:55,984 --> 00:13:01,239
Yikes. Okay, well, Ellison
wants Fisk as badly as we do.

187
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,784
Just tell him our plan. Watch how
fast he gives you your job back.

188
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,037
Then we'll hook up at the
dinner later. You're my plus one.

189
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,581
I got you the salmon.

190
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,310
Hey. Did the landlord let you in?

191
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,005
Dex.

192
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,716
Thanks for coming.

193
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,970
You made it pretty clear I
had to. What's this about?

194
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,973
I have someone here who
wants to talk to you.

195
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,434
Follow me.

196
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,705
Dex, this is my old
friend Andrea Morales.

197
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,833
She's an attorney.

198
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,337
The guys took up a collection
to pay for Andy's services.

199
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,631
Now if you're up for it,

200
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,967
she's going to sue the bureau for
wrongful suspension on your behalf.

201
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,303
- She can do that?
- I can.

202
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,305
And having reviewed the
details of your case,

203
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,182
I fully believe that I should.

204
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,644
She's on a retainer. Starting now.

205
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,812
And I'm not cheap.

206
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,689
The guys must really like
you, Agent Poindexter.

207
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,694
You've had my back through all this?

208
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,072
I don't know how to thank you.

209
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,766
The guy that saved our lives

210
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,411
doesn't ever have to
thank us for anything.

211
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,083
Well, figure out the
next steps, and, uh...

212
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,545
I can't wait to have
you back on the team.

213
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,216
I've prepared the argument.

214
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,495
You find anything?

215
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,080
He's neat. He likes order.

216
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,667
So does my wife, but she
wouldn't fit in your suit.

217
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,382
Everything I have on Dex
is circumstantial at best.

218
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,177
I just left him. He was solid.

219
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,265
I don't see a decorated agent
falling for Fisk's bullshit.

220
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,267
Yeah, well, that's what Fisk does.

221
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,645
Finds a weakness. Hits it hard.

222
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,897
When you're already on your knees,

223
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,191
you've got no choice but
to fall for his bullshit.

224
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,362
I bet you guys are paying
for his room service, too.

225
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,084
The suit's here. I can smell it.

226
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,961
What, you can smell it?

227
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,507
GSR and latex.

228
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,012
Shit. I can't call a crew to crack that.

229
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,103
What, you can do that?

230
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,647
Not if you keep talking, I can't.

231
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,546
The suit was here. He must've moved it.

232
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,090
Well, it isn't now.

233
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,802
And you smelling eau de suit
won't exactly sway a judge.

234
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,097
I'm telling you, Poindexter's
the guy. It was him.

235
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,018
There's nothing here tying
him to Fisk or the Bulletin.

236
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,938
We got jack shit.

237
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,616
When the crows come to the birdfeeder,

238
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,367
I kill them with rocks.

239
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,871
What does it feel
like to watch them die?

240
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,333
It probably won't even get
as far as an arbitration.

241
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,627
The government tends to
balk once folks lawyer up.

242
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,255
This is amazing. How long
do you think this will take?

243
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,676
If we do everything right, you'll
be reinstated in six months.

244
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,387
- Six months?
- But we'll get you back pay.

245
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,890
I don't care about back pay.

246
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,893
What am I going to do for six months?

247
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,228
I know it seems like a stretch,

248
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,190
but you've got a bright future
ahead of you in the bureau.

249
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,192
Play the long game.

250
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,364
Oh. I'll be right back.

251
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,202
This number has been blocked.

252
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,999
Have you been doing our exercises?

253
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,270
Yes, but then the neighbor

254
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:15,464
brought home a box of stray kittens.

255
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,133
They were in the yard.

256
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,221
I killed them with rocks, Dr. Mercer.

257
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,934
I tried not to, but I liked it.

258
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,151
So the guy has issues. Serious
issues. But that doesn't mean...

259
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,870
He's here. You should go.

260
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,706
No, we had a deal. No
evidence, you don't touch him.

261
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,208
- I found evidence.
- The kind that holds up in court.

262
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,668
He's gonna use the suit again.

263
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,546
I got the jump on him. I can
get him to tell me where it is.

264
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,008
- You gave me your word.
- Yeah, well, I take it back.

265
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,841
- We'll never get another chance like that.
- What if you're wrong?

266
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,575
I'm not wrong.

267
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,925
The shot came from across the alley.

268
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,927
I think it came from downstairs.

269
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,020
He's... He's ricocheting the bullets.

270
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,042
- Go for the front door.
- He's by the window.

271
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,359
He's waiting for a better shot.

272
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,278
How do you know?

273
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,038
He's only got three more rounds.

274
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,962
I'll tell you when he
reloads, and then you go.

275
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,709
Okay.

276
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,089
- He's not calling for backup.
- No. And he won't.

277
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,632
But the neighbor called 911.

278
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,305
God damn it, Dex.

279
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,851
Okay, now. Go, go, go!

280
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,179
Third floor, 2312 King Street.

281
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,097
Two suspects, violent.

282
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,976
Roger that, dispatch.
2312 King Street...

283
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,195
Police! Hands in the air!

284
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,959
I'm FBI. I have ID.

285
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,754
If you look in my pocket,
you'll find my wallet.

286
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,217
Two armed suspects broke into my home.

287
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,058
... tried not to, but I liked...

288
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,815
All right, all right,
everybody, settle down.

289
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,192
We're getting to the
good part of the evening.

290
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,527
You mean dessert?

291
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,781
As if you need another
freakin' cannoli, Mikey!

292
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,410
Our agenda tonight is simple.

293
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,038
Our endorsement of a candidate
for district attorney...

294
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,807
It's Karen. You know what to do.

295
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,375
Karen? Where the hell are you?

296
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,467
- How did you get up here?
- I checked into a room.

297
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,010
This floor FBI is personnel only.

298
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,970
Hi, I'm Karen Page.
I'm with the Bulletin.

299
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,054
We know who you are.

300
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,598
Well, I'd like to talk to him.

301
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,099
Not gonna happen.

302
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,853
Under his agreement, he's
entitled to speak to the press.

303
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,522
Unless you two wanna make
the call to violate that?

304
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,358
Fisk and his lawyers have to
sign off on all press requests.

305
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,321
They tell all you people to screw
off. You're wasting your time.

306
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,199
All right. Well, why
don't you call his lawyers

307
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,701
and tell them I want to give
Mr. Fisk a chance to comment

308
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,412
on a story that I'm writing
about a Marlene Vistain?

309
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,581
That's Fisk's mother.

310
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,665
Shit.

311
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,667
He actually had one?

312
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,339
Go ahead. Call his lawyers. I'll wait.

313
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,346
Prosecutions aren't the whole story.

314
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,765
The vast majority of our
caseload never sees a jury,

315
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,520
because we bring such strong cases

316
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:44,812
to bear that defendants
plead guilty voluntarily.

317
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:48,190
Which means more bad guys
in jail for less money.

318
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,067
Something we all can agree on?

319
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,368
Until you let them out of prison
again. Isn't that right, Mr. Tower?

320
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,705
Because you sign off on both
kinds of deals, don't you, sir?

321
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,415
Is that Foggy Nelson?

322
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,542
Uh...

323
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,960
Sure is, Mr. Gerlach.

324
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,878
What are you doing, Foggy?

325
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,340
I told your girlfriend if you ain't
on the ballot, you can't speak.

326
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,553
But the Nelsons are members, too,
and this is an endorsement meeting.

327
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,596
Members can ask questions,
isn't that right?

328
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,890
It ain't gonna change the vote, Foggy.

329
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,685
You're just holding up
dessert and pissing people off.

330
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,022
I apologize to everyone.
This won't take long.

331
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,732
Said every lawyer ever.

332
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,904
We can be long-winded, sure. But
I'm not billing anyone for this.

333
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,492
I'm running my own
write-in campaign for DA.

334
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,119
Most of you know that by now.

335
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,621
I'm not running 'cause I expect to win.

336
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm running to hold him accountable.

337
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,210
Debate is the soul of democracy.

338
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,589
So why aren't you
talking about Wilson Fisk?

339
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,465
Are you running for office, Mr. Tower,

340
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,594
or are you running away from
responsibility for his situation?

341
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,430
We've been here before, Mr. Nelson.

342
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,225
Do you still claim to have no
influence over his release from prison

343
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,186
to live among us here in the city again?

344
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,355
The powers of my office
are limited to state law.

345
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,692
Wilson Fisk's situation is entirely
under federal jurisdiction and...

346
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,975
You mean crimes he's
already been sentenced for?

347
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,082
- Of course.
- But you can prosecute

348
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:21,617
for crimes he's committing
right now, can't you?

349
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,743
What crimes?

350
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,829
The man is locked up in
FBI custody 24 hours a day.

351
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,916
In a five-star hotel.

352
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,251
Because he made a deal with the feds.

353
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:36,048
Living in luxury as long as he
gives up major underworld figures.

354
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,843
Which Fisk has done, time and
again, making this city safer.

355
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,679
Or making his competition disappear.

356
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,015
That's right.

357
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,687
Wilson Fisk is informing on
carefully-selected targets.

358
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,941
Using the government as his private army

359
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,293
to reclaim his position

360
00:28:55,294 --> 00:28:58,278
at the center of this
city's criminal underworld.

361
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,363
This is fantasy.

362
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,741
No, it's a harsh reality.

363
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,705
There are government officials who
are controlled by various criminals.

364
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,290
What Wilson Fisk has done

365
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,210
is take all those criminals
and turn them over to the FBI.

366
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,505
And keep all those corrupt
officials for himself.

367
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,225
He's planning to turn himself

368
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:23,597
into a one-stop shop for
bribery and protection.

369
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,722
It's all right here.

370
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,182
Mr. Nelson.

371
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,978
As district attorney, you
can't just pander to a crowd.

372
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,771
You have to prove your case.

373
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,773
- I can.
- No, you can't.

374
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,857
My turn.

375
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,320
At your fancy law firm, what
they teach is, "Create a fiction."

376
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,532
What story does a jury need
to hear? Not what facts.

377
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,451
I have been prosecuting for 13 years,

378
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,454
and I can tell you this is
not how criminal law works.

379
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,112
Moving speeches impress a crowd,

380
00:29:51,113 --> 00:29:53,375
but they don't stand
up in criminal court.

381
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,837
I don't have your experience, Mr. Tower.

382
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,381
It's true. But then again,

383
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,636
I'm not jaded from doing the same
thing for too many years, either.

384
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,556
I'm still passionate
about what the law can do.

385
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,976
And that's a very
powerful tool to work with.

386
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,604
Because when you get
beyond the cold facts

387
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,816
and really get worked up about
what you're doing, you can...

388
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,363
Holy shit.

389
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,157
I can't hear you.

390
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,660
You can do what, Mr. Nelson?
Freeze up in front of a jury?

391
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,760
We'll be watching.

392
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,477
You gotta be kidding me.

393
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,497
Ms. Page.

394
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:26,385
I must admit, I'm surprised you're here.

395
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,517
I suppose this qualifies as hard time?

396
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,812
Yes, I'm sure all of
this is offensive to you,

397
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,314
given our personal history.

398
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,652
You mean the times you
tried to have me killed?

399
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,489
Crimes for which I'm still paying.

400
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,910
Yes. It's offensive.

401
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,295
Tea?

402
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,715
No, thank you.

403
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,468
I'm not here for tea.

404
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,857
Sit down.

405
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,361
You came for words, at least.

406
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,322
Yeah.

407
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,118
Let's... Let's have some words.

408
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,798
You are not writing an
article about my mother.

409
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,802
I'm not?

410
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,433
I could.

411
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,185
To what end, Ms. Page?

412
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,437
My distress?

413
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,147
Hmm.

414
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,774
Doesn't actually sound that
bad, now that you say it.

415
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:09,196
I do not welcome
intrusions into my privacy.

416
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,490
Yet you invited me in?

417
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:17,579
You worked for Ben Urich, didn't you?

418
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,289
I believe he mentored you.

419
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,333
Yes, before he was murdered.

420
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,962
A final lesson. One you
seem not to have understood.

421
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,465
Is that a threat?

422
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,009
It's an observation.

423
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,263
Well, you're right.

424
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,601
I'm not here to talk about your mother.

425
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,980
I'd rather talk about what she told Ben.

426
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,611
Actually, really,
rather, what she told us.

427
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:56,701
See, I don't think you
know, but I was with him.

428
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,204
It probably wasn't fair.

429
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:04,167
Two trained journalists working
on a feeble old woman like that.

430
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,837
It's easy to push her.

431
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,174
Get her to say things
she doesn't want to.

432
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,801
Your point?

433
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,638
She remembered a lot
about your childhood.

434
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,268
They say the oldest memories
stick around the longest.

435
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:26,982
She remembered a lot of little things.
A lot of... embarrassing things.

436
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:32,404
Seems like there were a lot of
those, weren't there, Willie?

437
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,215
I'm sure your readers at the Bulletin

438
00:34:38,216 --> 00:34:40,412
will be as entertained as you are.

439
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,873
No, we would never print those.

440
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,126
We just pass them around the office.

441
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,379
How is it around your office?

442
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,718
I heard about your misfortune.

443
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,304
Before it even happened, I'm sure.

444
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,181
No, the story that we will print

445
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,059
is her very detailed
description of your father.

446
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,145
And how you murdered him.

447
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,565
A hammer.

448
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,403
At that age?

449
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:19,951
Is there any part of you
that isn't broken, I wonder?

450
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,735
You asked me why I let you in.

451
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:59,324
The reason is, Ms. Page, I
have a few questions of my own.

452
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,868
You are a respected journalist,

453
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:06,247
but at one time you were merely
a secretary at a law firm.

454
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,249
To Matt Murdock, yes?

455
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,459
Office manager.

456
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,587
Intimately involved in his affairs, huh?

457
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,255
His business affairs.

458
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,507
Of course.

459
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,360
Tell me, so at what point

460
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:21,763
did you learn about Mr.
Murdock's secret life?

461
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,062
Yeah.

462
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,106
Thank you.

463
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,692
Thank you, Ms. Page.

464
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,160
Okay.

465
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,163
Okay.

466
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,874
You want secrets?

467
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,294
I can tell you a secret, Wilson.

468
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,712
Okay if I call you that?

469
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,315
I feel like we know each
other well enough by now.

470
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,174
- As you wish, Karen.
- Great.

471
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,220
James Wesley.

472
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,518
What was it like for
you when he disappeared?

473
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:14,357
Really, it's those first 24 hours
that are the worst, aren't they?

474
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,028
When you call and you call and you
call, and there's just no answer.

475
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,780
It becomes an obsession.

476
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:27,787
The calling. The never-ending loop
of a ghost's voice mail in your ear.

477
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,914
You worry.

478
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,083
You wonder.

479
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,335
You swear, "God damn it,

480
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,421
if he's still living, I'm
gonna kill him myself."

481
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,800
Is that what it was like for you?

482
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,385
Did you rage at him?

483
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,180
'Cause you thought he betrayed you?

484
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,098
Because I wonder what
would be worse for you.

485
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,017
His duplicity or his death?

486
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,649
He died quickly.

487
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,902
If you were wondering.

488
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,529
Didn't suffer much.

489
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,903
You see, Wilson, Matt
Murdock isn't the person

490
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:06,785
you should be worried about.

491
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,662
I killed Wesley.

492
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,209
I shot him seven times.

493
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,378
Because the clip ran
out. He deserved more.

494
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,839
Don't move!

495
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,136
What?

496
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,436
What?

497
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:35,814
Foggy?

498
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,320
Think of it as a compliment.

499
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,531
That they actually thought
I would try to kill him?

500
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,814
- I had to tell them something.
- No, Foggy, you didn't.

501
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,244
You ruined it. I had him.

502
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,830
Had him? Fisk would
snap you like a twig.

503
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,498
At least they'd have it on video.

504
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,126
Was that really your plan?

505
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,381
God damn it, Karen. Don't
turn into Matt on me.

506
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,638
Look, I didn't want him to
kill me. Just come after me.

507
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,515
Oh, good.

508
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,519
- Well, I got the idea from you.
- Me?

509
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,896
All that talk about Tower
and catching him off guard,

510
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,149
and I thought, "Yeah, just
get Fisk to stop thinking

511
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,193
and reacting emotionally instead."

512
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,363
I figured you were thinking
something like that.

513
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,866
Not a bad plan, actually.

514
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,869
Except for the part where you
have to hope the FBI comes in

515
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,620
before that monster beats you to death.

516
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,985
Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

517
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,834
How did you even know I was here?

518
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,669
I know you.

519
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,087
When you didn't come...

520
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,884
I thought of some possibilities
and this was my nightmare scenario.

521
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,594
So I pretty much counted on it.

522
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,013
At least I took my shot.

523
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,264
You took a shot.

524
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,267
Tomorrow, there's gonna
be an army shooting back.

525
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,107
The report, for your insurance.

526
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:02,817
Thank you.

527
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,391
Come with me.

528
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,564
Yeah, yeah, another late one.

529
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,354
I know, babe, but

530
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:09,694
they're filing charges
against the Albanians tomorrow,

531
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,238
and I never reviewed my account.

532
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,325
Yeah, I'm not gonna
make it home tonight.

533
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,913
Kiss Sami for me.

534
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,292
I love you, too.

535
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,307
Boss.

536
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:22,975
Nadeem.

537
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,144
Sorry to wake you.

538
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,315
We need to talk.

539
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:27,707
After you.

540
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,265
This was here the whole time?

541
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,349
Yes.

542
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,229
We, um...

543
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,482
I have a problem.

544
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,319
Nadeem knows.

545
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,737
I know he does.

546
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,240
We will take care of the problem.

547
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,166
Dex...

548
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,296
rage cannot stay inside.

549
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:22,178
It needs to go somewhere...
or it becomes a poison.

550
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,388
It will kill you from within.

551
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:30,061
I find that when this rage
cannot stay buried in me

552
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,812
for one more second...

553
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:38,986
that a primal scream... is
the only satisfying release.

554
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,865
Yes.

555
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,285
Yeah.

556
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,248
I like making things happen

557
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,399
without anybody knowing
it's me who did it.

558
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:20,361
Let's do our exercise. Close your eyes.

559
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,862
He didn't have any parents.

560
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,739
I'm digging a hole.

561
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,033
Spent a lot of time fighting.

562
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,797
Buried my anger in the ground.

563
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,953
- Good.
- Angry.

564
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:33,374
- Now cover it with dirt.
- Okay. But, Dr. Mercer?

565
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,395
- Go ahead and say it.
- I want to open the box.

566
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,004
I promised to keep my mouth shut.

567
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,423
- But you want to say it sounds familiar.
- Does it?

568
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,014
I didn't have anyone either,
but I'm nothing like him.

569
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,852
The tapes make it sound like
he was a killer at a young age.

570
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,270
The guy's a psychopath.

571
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,234
And I had a chance today.

572
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,238
A shot to catch him off
guard, and I blew it.

573
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,199
You did what you thought was right.

574
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,119
You kept your word to Agent Nadeem.

575
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,203
Yeah.

576
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,333
And how many people
will die because of it?

577
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,397
I don't know if I have the
strength to get through this.

578
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,610
He's so stubborn.

579
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,946
Full of fury and foolish pride.

580
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,908
Please...

581
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,577
watch over him.

582
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:57,291
Keep him from making the same
damned mistake that took you from us.

583
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,836
Our son is too much like you, Jack.

584
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,636
Mom?

585
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,137
Mom.

586
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,392
No.
