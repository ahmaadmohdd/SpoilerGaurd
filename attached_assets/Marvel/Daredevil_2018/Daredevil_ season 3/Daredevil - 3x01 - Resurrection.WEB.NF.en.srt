1
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,277
Father Lantom. Clinton Church.

2
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,457
...bright idea to bring him in?

3
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,502
He's one of ours, Maggie.
What other choice did I have?

4
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,380
Metro-General maybe? Call 911.

5
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,673
He's a vigilante.

6
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,219
If he goes to a hospital,
the police will arrest him.

7
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,763
This is Sister Maggie Grace
at St. Agnes Orphanage...

8
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,976
It's Matthew. Jack Murdock's son.

9
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,063
I'm very sorry. I made a mistake.

10
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,483
Get wire cutters. We need
to get him out of this suit.

11
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,361
Go to the kitchen and bring... we have.

12
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,243
- How can I help?
- You've done enough.

13
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,874
Where did you go, Elektra?

14
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,003
We're gonna die here.

15
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,757
This is what living feels like.

16
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,250
Get Maggie. Tell her he's awake.

17
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:17,507
Elektra...

18
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,656
- How do you feel?
- Don't try to stand up.

19
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,824
Where... where...

20
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,993
St. Agnes. The orphanage.

21
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,831
- How long? How long?
- Lay down. Several weeks.

22
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,242
- Where is she?
- Who?

23
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:31,286
Elektra. I...

24
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:32,792
I don't know who that is.

25
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,295
Stay in the bed.

26
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,672
- You'll hurt yourself.
- My right ear... I can't...

27
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,135
Just stop this right now!

28
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,681
Damn it, Matthew!

29
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,479
Now I can't see. I can't see.

30
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,686
I can't see!

31
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,147
I can't see! I can't see!

32

33
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,689
Matthew?

34
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,401
Father.

35
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,779
I didn't know you were there.

36
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,702
Must feel strange to be back here.

37
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,038
The place where you grew up.

38
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,830
I haven't thanked you yet, Father.

39
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,127
Figured we could count on
the nuns for their discretion.

40
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,937
The nuns know who you are, but
Sister Maggie swore them to secrecy.

41
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,567
After she swore at me.

42
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,095
If you want to take Communion...

43
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:50,273
we could, uh...

44
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,019
Or we could just talk.

45
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,610
Elektra...

46
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,904
was with me when the building collapsed.

47
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,076
Matthew, Elektra passed months ago.

48
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,204
- We had a funeral for her.
- No, shh... I remember.

49
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,333
I know it sounds crazy. I'm
telling you, she was there.

50
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,416
I was...

51
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,879
holding on to her when...

52
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,342
In any case, the building was
surrounded when it collapsed.

53
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,276
Nobody else was seen getting out.

54
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,927
I am so sorry, Matthew.

55
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,770
How about I take your confession
and we go ahead with the Eucharist?

56
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,063
Not today, Father.

57
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,819
Mystical thinking is
not my bag, Matthew.

58
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,323
Hell, I'm probably the most
rational crank in the whole diocese,

59
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:54,205
but even I have to admit...
it is a miracle you survived.

60
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,504
Our conversations, they
usually go this way.

61
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,132
I come to you with questions.

62
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:08,718
You tell me what you
understand about God.

63
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:11,724
- Nature of the gig, I guess.
- Give it a rest, shall we?

64
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,891
Sure.

65
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,104
I'll be around. I'll, uh...

66
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,525
When you're ready to talk...

67
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,612
we'll talk.

68
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,578
Is he dead?

69
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:38,458
Boo.

70
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,170
- Who are you?
- Same as you.

71
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:44,378
I grew up here.

72
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,466
Damn! What happened to you?

73
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,216
Life.

74
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,053
This room is off limits.

75
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:56,473
And if you're well enough to be up,
you're well enough to be in class.

76
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,643
Sorry, Sister.

77
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:02,779
Hello again, Matthew.

78
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,818
They're scared of you, huh?

79
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,821
So were you when you were their age.

80
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,076
I need to change your gauze.

81
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,371
Preferably without you
flailing around like an idiot.

82
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,710
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised by any of this.

83
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,462
You were always pissed off.

84
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,551
Of course, back then, you were
just a boy who lost his eyesight.

85
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:35,097
And now, you're the
Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

86
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,723
You've heard of me.

87
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,936
I live in an orphanage,
not under a rock.

88
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:43,251
I just never imagined
it'd be one of ours

89
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,988
running around in
that Halloween costume.

90
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,201
The things I've heard you can do...

91
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:50,868
You are blind, right?

92
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:54,075
You weren't just faking
it the whole time?

93
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,078
Congratulations.

94
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,497
You finally caught me.

95
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,749
It's not a fair question?

96
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,170
Yeah, the accident blinded me.

97
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,342
It just also, uh,
sharpened my other senses.

98
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,178
Not to worry, Sister.

99
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,764
Those days are behind me.

100
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,767
I'm deaf in my right ear, and I
can't even walk to the bathroom now.

101
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,522
Yeah, well, you're pretty banged up.

102
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,733
Your spine, your hip.

103
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,904
Well, the days of doing
backflips might be over, but...

104
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,992
you'll get back on your feet.

105
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,078
Now that you're out of the woods...

106
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,914
You want me to go.

107
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,583
It's not a convalescent home.

108
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,585
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

109
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,754
I'll figure something out.

110
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,302
There must be at least one
person I can call for you.

111
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:56,929
No.

112
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:00,938
There's no one.

113
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,889
Yeah. No, I filed that story already.

114
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:06,350
Yeah! No, look...

115
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:08,886
Oh, that. No. Uh, part
five still needs a quote.

116
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:11,191
I put out a few lines.
We'll get a bite soon.

117
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,359
Yeah, okay.

118
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,570
Yeah, I'll have it for
you by the end of the day.

119
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,365
All right. Yeah. Bye.

120
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,331
Shit.

121
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,124
What am I doing here, Matt?

122
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,296
I have something that I need you to see.

123
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,470
I'm Daredevil.

124
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,691
How was the walk?

125
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,193
I just needed some space.

126
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,835
- It's a lot...
- No, of course. I get it.

127
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,449
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

128
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,790
Can you see me?

129
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:51,750
No. No, not "see" exactly.

130
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:54,734
It's different. It's, um...

131
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,424
I think it's better.

132
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,678
"Different" how? "Better" how?

133
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:05,643
Well, I can sense things about you.

134
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,810
Okay. Like what?

135
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,229
Oh, God. It's really
hard to explain. Um...

136
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,647
Try me.

137
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,442
I know that you stopped
on the way over here.

138
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,154
At our favorite Indian place.

139
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,157
Probably it was a trip down memory lane,

140
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,953
'cause you didn't eat
but you did order a drink.

141
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,123
See, I can smell the curry
on your clothes, and I can...

142
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,790
taste the Jameson's off your lips.

143
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,762
I know that just telling you all
that makes you uncomfortable...

144
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:37,891
'cause I can hear your heartbeat.

145
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,426
This is humiliating.

146
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,305
Karen, I should've told you. You
have every right to be angry...

147
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,059
Yeah. I should be. I should
be really angry at you.

148
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,771
But I watched you fight for me.

149
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,106
Twice, actually.

150
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,277
You know I dreamed about that?

151
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,406
I played it over in my mind
again and again, and I keep...

152
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,240
How can I be this mad at
someone who saved my life?

153
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:09,453
Because he's your friend and you
care for him and he broke your trust.

154
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,874
Yeah, well, stop agreeing
with me. It's making it worse.

155
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:17,900
Can I get you a drink?

156
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,055
And he knows I nodded.

157
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:32,985
So, the whole cane thing,
it's just... an act?

158
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,146
Yep.

159
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,233
Sorry. Why?

160
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,403
Why didn't you trust me?

161
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,531
- What, did you think I would judge you?
- No.

162
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,282
I didn't judge Frank.
Why would I judge you?

163
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,952
Well, maybe you should judge Frank.

164
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,745
Castle's a killer. I'm not.

165
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,956
You don't always know
what motivates people.

166
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,003
Uh, yeah, but I know when they lie
to me. Their heartbeats tell me.

167
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,342
Here's what I know. I will
never lie to you again.

168
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,013
That's a promise. All
right? Ask me anything.

169
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,481
Where do you keep it?

170
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,443
In the closet. In the chest.

171
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,409
Holy shit.

172
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,128
What... what happens now?

173
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:35,581
It's over. That's it. I'm
gonna leave Daredevil behind.

174
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,085
Really? You can just do that?

175
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,170
Yeah.

176
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:47,050
You know... you and Foggy had me
almost convinced it was alcohol.

177
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,093
It makes a lot of sense.

178
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,513
You know, the secrecy, abandoning
social and professional commitments.

179
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,891
It... It certainly
sounds like an addict.

180
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,777
Well, it's not like that.

181
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,815
Help me out, then, because I'm not you.

182
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,817
I can't tell if you're
lying to me or not.

183
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:24,006
I don't need him to be
a part of me anymore.

184
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,676
And I don't want him to be.

185
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,140
I want to believe you.

186
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,065
I'm not so sure
Daredevil is the problem.

187
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,182
Ouch.

188
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,660
Shit.

189
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,785
Karen?

190
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,372
Hey, Karen, you here?

191
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,333
- Hey. You okay?
- Hey. Yeah.

192
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,367
Yeah, yeah, fine. Thanks for coming.

193
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,718
Did the building manager let you in?

194
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,840
Um...

195
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,929
I thought you said you
were packing the place up.

196
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:12,703
Yeah. Uh...

197
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:13,955
Remember how I told you

198
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,265
I was gonna talk to Matt's
landlord about letting his place go?

199
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,338
Uh-huh.

200
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,646
Surprise.

201
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,815
What, so when you asked me
to help you move boxes...

202
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,650
Uh, yeah, I lied.

203
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,194
I mean, technically it
was more of, like, a ruse.

204
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,698
- Gotcha. You rused.
- Hmm.

205
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,785
Journalism has changed you, Page.

206
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,994
So what am I doing here?

207
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,196
Oh! Uh... Right. Yeah. So...
Wait! Are you living here?

208
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,794
Oh! No. God, no. I'm
just paying the bills,

209
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,132
or some of them, until
Matt gets back, but, um...

210
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,218
Matt's being evicted.

211
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,640
Yeah, I need you to help me convince
his landlord to give me an extension.

212
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,375
- Karen...
- No, just, carrying two rents...

213
00:16:59,378 --> 00:17:01,756
I'm behind this month. That's all.

214
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,078
As much as it hurts me to say this,

215
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,787
you're a reporter.

216
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,541
Look at the facts. A building
fell on Matt. A big one.

217
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,877
And nobody's heard from him since.

218
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,338
Matt's dead.

219
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,469
That's the first time
I've said that out loud.

220
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,639
I don't want to accept it, either.

221
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,640
Especially since I'm the one who...

222
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,267
- you know...
- No.

223
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,313
- ...brought him the Devil suit.
- Hey, don't...

224
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,149
do that to yourself.

225
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:50,188
You know that was his choice.
He'd have gotten to that suit

226
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:52,027
whether you brought it to him or not.

227
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:54,531
I know.

228
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,618
But it doesn't stop me from wishing

229
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,888
I'd brought him some sweatpants instead.

230
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,713
You're right. Everything you're
saying is making sense. I just...

231
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,759
I know it's irrational...

232
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,887
but I can just feel it.

233
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,808
He's not dead.

234
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,192
I'll take care of these
and one more month's rent.

235
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,443
No, no. Uh...

236
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,781
Let's just split 'em
down the middle, 50-50.

237
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,702
Fine, but then that's it, okay?

238
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,666
Come on, then.

239
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,921
It's away from the kids, so you
can stay here as long as you need.

240
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,965
Bit musty, though.

241
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,007
I can't smell anything anyway.

242
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,776
- That music...
- The chapel is right above us.

243
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,196
Yeah, but isn't that Arabic?

244
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,823
The mosque on 39th had a pipe burst,

245
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,786
so we're sharing our
space for a few weeks.

246
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,914
Hell's Kitchen takes care of its own.

247
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,751
This will have to do.

248
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,590
It's also the laundry room,
so it'll be noisy at times.

249
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,383
I can always turn a deaf ear to it.

250
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,263
See? There's a bright
side to everything.

251
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,472
- I'll need help getting him into bed.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,195
No, I'd like to stay up a while.

253
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:49,531
Then I can take it from here, Paul.

254
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,355
Matthew, if you wanna talk...

255
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,692
No. Thank you.

256
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,407
So...

257
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,036
the bed's right in front of you.

258
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,664
Sister Anne wired you up.

259
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:14,671
If you press that, we'll hear
you upstairs and come running.

260
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,133
Because we don't have
anything better to do.

261
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,969
Very Christian of you.

262
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:27,726
Angry, sarcastic... and stubborn.

263
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,271
Maybe you don't have any friends.

264
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,943
Someone once told me that
warriors were meant to be alone.

265
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,113
That caring for people
would make me weak.

266
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,906
Sounds like he needed to get laid.

267
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,118
Ha! That actually explains a lot.

268
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,329
I mean, he was right, of course.

269
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,083
I let people in, I paid a price.

270
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,875
I won't make that mistake again.

271
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,878
What is this?

272
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,297
Dug those out of storage.

273
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,009
You were probably the
last one to read 'em.

274
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,809
My Bible.

275
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,063
All right. I get the hint.

276
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,233
And I get the sense
things are complicated

277
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,650
with you and the guy upstairs.

278
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,528
No. Not at all.

279
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,700
If anything, I'd say we finally
know where we stand with each other.

280
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,327
"There was a man from the land of Uz..."

281
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,412
Book of Job.

282
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,871
The Book of Job.

283
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,748
The story of God's perfect servant, Job.

284
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,001
He prayed every day at dawn,

285
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,795
with his knees on the
ground, his face in the dirt.

286
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,881
Slaughtered ten goats, one
for each of his children,

287
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,050
and burned them at the
altar in God's honor.

288
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,803
Of all of God's soldiers,
Job, he was the most loyal.

289
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,263
I know the story, Matthew.

290
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,975
Oh. Then you know what happens next.

291
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,561
God murdered all ten of
his children in cold blood.

292
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,271
Scorched every inch of Job's land.

293
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,274
Lashed at his body till his
skin was covered in bloody welts.

294
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,736
God rained shit and misery on the
life of his most perfect servant.

295
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,866
And still... Job would not curse him.

296
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,703
You know what I realized?

297
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,539
Job was a pussy.

298
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,003
You see, that was me, Sister.

299
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,483
I suffered willingly. I gave my, uh...

300
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,346
sweat and blood and
skin without complaint.

301
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,434
Because I too believed
I was God's soldier.

302
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,439
Well, not anymore.

303
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,819
I am what I do in the dark now.

304
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,948
I bleed only for myself.

305
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,857
You weren't listening.

306
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,570
I heard every spiteful word.

307
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,031
You might hate God right now,
but the feeling is not mutual.

308
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,701
No, I don't hate him.

309
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,372
I've just seen his true face, is all.

310
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,876
And, for the record, I
had friends. I had a life.

311
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,877
I care about people,

312
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,007
and I'm choosing to let them
believe that I'm gone because I am.

313
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,843
I'm not Job.

314
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,890
And I know my truth now.

315
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:55,851
What truth?

316
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,444
Well, that in front of this God...

317
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,532
I'd rather die as the Devil
than live as Matt Murdock.

318
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,386
Quiet!

319
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:42,538
We have good news, Mr. Fisk.

320
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,293
Your appeal is proceeding as discussed.

321
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,463
News.

322
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,008
That implies new information.

323
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,719
Let's start there.

324
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,680
We'll remind you, we're
only the messengers.

325
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,972
We've been doing everything
we can to help her.

326
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:03,269
But there have been some setbacks

327
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,519
regarding Ms. Marianna's return.

328
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,358
It's going to be more
complicated than we anticipated.

329
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,533
How so?

330
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:18,952
The federal government has decided

331
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:20,955
to charge her as an accessory.

332
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:25,164
If they locate her overseas
or she sets foot on US soil,

333
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,669
she'll face prosecution and prison.

334
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,388
I see.

335
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,601
Leave.

336
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,026
What on earth are you doing?

337
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,154
Falling.

338
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,408
I brought you something.

339
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,827
Is it food? I can't smell anything.

340
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,453
A hot toddy.

341
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,207
It'll help open your sinuses.

342
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,584
Thank you.

343
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,672
And you need to keep taking these.

344
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:52,731
Well, it's hot, but... I still can't
taste anything but blood and ash.

345
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,108
Cheers.

346
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,528
Pills and liquor, modern
medicine at its finest.

347
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,904
Easy, smart-ass.

348
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,367
If you want modern medicine,
the door's straight ahead.

349
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,182
- It doesn't matter anyway.
- That's the spirit.

350
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:11,246
How's the buzzing?

351
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,375
Not getting better.

352
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:14,763
Give it time.

353
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:17,088
After the beating you
took, everything's swollen.

354
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,342
Maybe your hearing will
come back when it goes down.

355
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,429
Or maybe it'll come back when you
take your head out of your ass.

356
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,560
How many of these did you have?

357
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,022
What you said...

358
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,444
about rather dying as the Devil
than living as Matt Murdock...

359
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:46,699
I just want you to know
that I think you're a hero.

360
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,329
Hiding down here, feeling
sorry for yourself.

361
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,913
I mean, just out back,

362
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,460
there's an orphanage full of kids
who've lost everything and everyone.

363
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:00,630
Some of them are disabled, much
worse off than you ever were.

364
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,758
And they're still trying to make the
most out of life, the little cowards.

365
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,220
Okay. All right.

366
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:10,598
And here you are, with
all the gifts God gave you.

367
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,145
Handsome, smart, a law degree,
and people who care about you.

368
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,689
And you're bravely giving up.

369
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,025
Well, you know, thank you...

370
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,654
for the tough love, Sister.

371
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:27,617
And your charmingly simplistic
view of God and the world.

372
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,327
I appreciate everything
you've done for me, I do,

373
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,580
but don't for a second think you
know anything about me or my life.

374
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,751
I've been a nun for 30 years.

375
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,919
I know self-pity when I hear it.

376
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,005
Okay, good.

377
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,717
Your father was famous around here.

378
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,262
I saw him fight.

379
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,934
I saw him go down many times.

380
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,770
But he never stayed down.

381
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:08,883
Oh.

382
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:25,131
What in God's name have...

383
00:34:25,134 --> 00:34:26,550
- Feel that?
- Feel what?

384
00:34:26,553 --> 00:34:28,138
Three subway lines run beneath us.

385
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,488
At any given time, there are six
different trains vibrating the ground.

386
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,444
That was the E train.

387
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:36,756
Was it now?

388
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:38,324
You brought food.

389
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,702
I did. I brought you some...

390
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,247
Beef ravioli from Nonna's. Nice.

391
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:45,920
Now you're just showing off.

392
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,421
He wants to know that he's still got it.

393
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,836
I am not comfortable with that idea.

394
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,594
Now you're uncomfortable?

395
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,721
Heal the body, and
the spirit will follow.

396
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,517
It's the other way around.

397
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:04,977
He needs this.

398
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,270
It's the only damn thing
that's gotten him out of bed.

399
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,774
So please just do it.

400
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,119
Thanks for making this happen.

401
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,997
Hands should be used for God's work.

402
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:27,816
Yeah? That's why he made me this way?

403
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:30,136
No. That's why he made boxing.

404
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,588
- Gloves?
- Helmet first.

405
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,191
No, I can't. It'll throw me off.

406
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:38,801
- Don't be an idiot.
- Sister, listen to me.

407
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,263
For this to work, I have
to feel and hear everything.

408
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,182
Now, remember the deal.
Keep your mouth shut.

409
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,561
Beats the Hail Marys.

410
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,943
You want me to hit a blind guy?

411
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,529
All right.

412
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,308
Cut! Time!

413
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,437
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

414
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,356
Damn. He hits hard.

415
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,359
It's really something. To
see it with my own eyes.

416
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,571
No. Something feels off. It
feels like I'm underwater.

417
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,406
- Maybe we should stop.
- No, no, no.

418
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,701
Ding-ding. Let's go again.

419
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:56,921
Matthew?

420
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,741
Matthew!

421
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,640
You should see the other guy.

422
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,106
For what it's worth...

423
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,610
you were incredible.

424
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,947
Thank you. Sister, I...

425
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,120
Did your head spin around?
Then wear it for me.

426
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,502
You've been very kind to me.

427
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,878
I have, haven't I?

428
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,758
And patient. Very, very patient.

429
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,968
Don't tell anyone. They'll
think I've gone soft.

430
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,264
No. I don't think there's
any danger of that.

431
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,392
Let me look at you.

432
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,981
I used to sew up my dad.

433
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,733
And your stitches are perfect.

434
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,404
Well, there's plenty
of practice around here.

435
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,160
Everything okay?

436
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,787
Yeah. It's fine.

437
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,541
I just have to get back upstairs.

438
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,469
I don't suppose there's any
hope you'd come to Mass with me?

439
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,555
Maybe next time.

440
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,892
I'll hold you to that.

441
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:13,023
Hey! Hey, get off of him!
Hey! What are you doing? Dad!

442
00:40:13,026 --> 00:40:14,829
Dad! Hey!

443
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,853
Help! Get off! Help!

444
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,647
Oh, my God! Dad! Dad...

445
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,312
Stay with me. We'll
get you to the hospital.

446
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,596
Come on!

447
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,975
Hey, asshole, this was
none of your business.

448
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,436
Come on.

449
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,005
We should kill this son of a bitch.

450
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,759
Nah, man. Leave him.

451
00:41:55,853 --> 00:41:56,972
Hold on.

452
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,569
God forgive me.

453
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,867
Leave him. Let's get out of here.

454
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,570
We seriously out of turkey?
You didn't swing by the deli?

455
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:55,111
I did, actually.

456
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:59,034
I ran into a little payment
snafu at the register.

457
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,497
I wanted to make it through the
party before I brought it up.

458
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,539
Huh.

459
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,584
Uh, which card did you
use? The red Visa, right?

460
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,421
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- Huh.

461
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,031
Hey, Dad.

462
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:15,549
Hey! There's the birthday goon!

463
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,586
Masi Savina wanted to know
if you're ruining dinner.

464
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,308
Excuse me?

465
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,143
Is she trying to undermine
my culinary talents again?

466
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,146
Get over here.

467
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,191
Let me show you how a
master chef does his thing.

468
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,944
Check this out.

469
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,362
See what I'm doing here, Sami?

470
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,617
This is a technique called "skimming."

471
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,411
High degree of difficulty.

472
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:43,871
Ta-da!

473
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,290
- Wanna do the honors?
- Yes.

474
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:52,376
Are you positive you used the red Visa?

475
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:56,333
I paid that one last week.
That one should be good.

476
00:43:56,336 --> 00:44:00,636
I tried the red Visa, the blue
Visa, the silver Mastercard...

477
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,766
I even tried my library card.

478
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,979
It's okay.

479
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,982
- Nothing we haven't handled before.
- Hmm.

480
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,150
If I could have the floor for a minute?

481
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,069
If you haven't heard by now,

482
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,905
despite Nihar shouting
it from the rooftops...

483
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:26,244
...my courageous sister-in-law
is now 100% cancer-free.

484
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,708
We know that it hasn't
been easy for you,

485
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,545
with all the obstacles you've faced.

486
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,633
Being denied insurance
over and over again.

487
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,176
Those asshole institutions
running you over like a tank.

488
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:47,276
Anyway...

489
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:49,186
tonight, we celebrate.

490
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:53,873
This one's for you,
Saanvi. Cheers. Cheers.

491
00:44:53,876 --> 00:44:55,982
We couldn't have done
it without you, brother.

492
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,110
No, please don't.

493
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,363
I'm serious, Ray.

494
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,327
You two did the work. I
just wrote a few checks.

495
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,455
What are you doing out here, bug?

496
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,833
Everyone's eaten. We're
waiting to light the candles.

497
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:13,961
I don't think I want any.

498
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,213
No cake? He doesn't want any cake.

499
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,300
There must be something
seriously wrong with him.

500
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,531
No, seriously, bug. What's up?

501
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:26,345
I don't know why we had to
have our family party today.

502
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,601
I told you, Ricky Thomas
is having friends over

503
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:33,353
I could be at his house, glow
bowling in his basement right now.

504
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,816
The Thomases have a bowling
alley in their basement?

505
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,150
Let me tell you something.

506
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:42,054
Come the summer, you're the one
who's gonna be throwing mad parties,

507
00:45:42,057 --> 00:45:45,100
because the pool is
definitely happening this year.

508
00:45:45,103 --> 00:45:46,950
- Really?
- You bet.

509
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,078
I'm gonna be tossing your butt
off the diving board by June.

510
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,832
Now, what do you say we go
inside, throw back some cake?

511
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,195
- Okay.
- Yeah?

512
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,340
- The pool, huh?
- No, don't.

513
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:06,261
Listen, Nadia said one of her
literacy tutors quit last week.

514
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,805
Maybe I could pick up some
evening hours at the center...

515
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,016
Not another job. We've
been down this road before.

516
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,935
I know, Ray, but I can't
see another way out.

517
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,439
I'll fix this.

518
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,567
I'll fix everything.

519
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,998
I've got a nine o'clock with Salazar,
so unless you got something quick...

520
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,712
- Salazar just got called downtown.
- Well, make yourself at home.

521
00:47:21,377 --> 00:47:22,506
Thanks.

522
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,925
My performance review.

523
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,096
That's not until the end
of the month, correct?

524
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,767
I'd like it moved up.
I'd like to do it now.

525
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,562
That's a tall order, Ray.

526
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,771
Performance review isn't the
kind of thing we shuffle around.

527
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,568
Then how come mine's
been deferred twice now?

528
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,945
You're denying me the
advancement opportunities

529
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,697
that I have rightfully earned.

530
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,784
No, not the Bureau. You.

531
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,955
Now, why you'd do something like
that to me, I don't have a clue.

532
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,292
But maybe it's time I file
a complaint with the EEO.

533
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,044
You're right.

534
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,253
Your reviews have been deferred

535
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,172
for reasons having nothing to do
with scheduling or restructuring

536
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,802
or whatever bullshit
I fed you at the time.

537
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,763
It's because I'm trying to protect you.

538
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,432
Protect me?

539
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,435
Do you have any idea
what your FICO score is?

540
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:23,864
- 557. Your FICO score is 557.
- So it's not stellar. You know, I...

541
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:27,871
You're buried in debt, and that
makes you a recruitment target.

542
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,199
It's Bureau policy not to promote

543
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,366
someone with that
level of vulnerability.

544
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:37,164
My circumstances were
exceptional, and you know that.

545
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,291
- My sister-in-law was sick and I...
- I am sorry for that.

546
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,753
Three and a half years.

547
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,716
I haven't had a pay bump
in three and a half years.

548
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,177
I know it's wrong.

549
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,429
I know.

550
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,016
You're a fine agent.

551
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:01,188
But I can't make this happen for
you. Not until you fix your finances.

552
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,109
But look...

553
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,834
while I got you here...
your number's up.

554
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,160
Nice. Nice timing.

555
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,037
It's a shit errand. I get it.

556
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,043
We talk to this guy every month,
and every month he gives us nothing.

557
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,837
It's a nice drive, though.

558
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,404
Mr. Fisk,

559
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:55,949
I'm Special Agent Ray Nadeem with
he Federal Bureau of Investigation.

560
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,037
The FBI would like
your assistance with...

561
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,833
Let's cut to the part where
you tell me to eat shit,

562
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,753
so we can stop wasting
each other's time, huh?

563
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,176
Tell me, Special Agent Nadeem...

564
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,721
do you have anyone in your
life who you love so much,

565
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,725
you'd do anything to protect them?

566
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,126
Are you threatening me?

567
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,610
I have made many mistakes.

568
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:38,201
But I accept the debt I'm
paying because of them.

569
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,872
But what I will not accept...

570
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,210
is that the woman that I love
should have to pay for them, too.

571
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,427
I would do anything to protect her.

572
00:50:56,695 --> 00:50:58,297
Anything.

573
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:09,024
What is it you're saying?

574
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:14,484
I want to make a deal.

575
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:24,953
