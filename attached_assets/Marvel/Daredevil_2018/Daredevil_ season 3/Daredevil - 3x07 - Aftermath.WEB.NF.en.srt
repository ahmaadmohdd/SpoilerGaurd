00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,120
The painting that's
intended for this wall

3
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,499
is something I am specially attached to.

4
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,669
Of course. Rabbit in a Snowstorm.

5
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,587
Yes, the agreement.

6
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:51,051
It said I was to get all my
belongings restored to me.

7
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,764
Precisely. And we might be able
to use this violation of terms

8
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,683
to lobby the feds for something else.

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,101
The painting!

10
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,523
That's what I'm interested in.

11
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:09,611
I can assure you we're doing
everything in our power, but...

12
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,573
there's a challenge to
your ownership claim.

13
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,837
It comes home.

14
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,089
Do you understand?

15
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,941
Lawyer's out! Cameras back on!

16
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,342
Wellers, we have a
situation. Report to the CP.

17
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,413
Shit.

18
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,751
Inside. Shut the door.

19
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,514
Show them to me.

20
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,640
All units on the citywide, NYPD...

21
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,613
Shit. Are you hearing this?
What happened at the Bulletin?

22
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,241
We should be there, not
stuck here with this asshole.

23
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,409
He go to bed?

24
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,038
Turned in early. Nice and
cozy, while the world explodes.

25
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,624
And now the news, Mrs. Shelby.

26
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,170
... rushed to nearby hospitals
in critical condition.

27
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,090
But what we do know is that,
according to several eyewitnesses,

28
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,593
the brutal attack on the Bulletin staff

29
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,055
has been carried out by
none other than Daredevil.

30
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,600
The word from the witnesses we've
spoken with is that Daredevil,

31
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,394
Hell's Kitchen's renowned
vigilante, is the perpetrator.

32
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,147
... they don't know the whereabouts
of Daredevil or whether...

33
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,961
This brutal act hits Hell's Kitchen

34
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:19,402
after a period of
relative calm in the city,

35
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,030
with the FBI arresting
many of New York's...

36
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,104
You're missing the point. He didn't
just find someone to wear my suit.

37
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,441
Someone as fast and skilled as I've
ever seen, and I couldn't take him.

38
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,902
- He found someone to kill me.
- Matthew...

39
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,529
I was stupid enough to think
that I had Fisk cornered.

40
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,940
He knew I'd find the witness,

41
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:48,200
and I just brought
the sheep to slaughter.

42
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,534
Jasper Evans is dead.

43
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,287
He's dead and he leaves a
son behind, and that's on me!

44
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,666
I was so sure that I finally
was out in front of this bastard.

45
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,251
And Fisk, he knew I thought that.

46
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,770
- He was waiting for me.
- Matthew...

47
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,630
Foggy and Karen both
could've been killed.

48
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,037
And there would have been nothing

49
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,508
I could have done to stop it. Nothing.

50
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,637
You're losing blood. I
need to stitch you up.

51
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,349
I listened to you. I listened
to you, and they almost died.

52
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,227
God damn it. I'm such an idiot.

53
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,189
No.

54
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,984
I'm the idiot.

55
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,031
I told you to involve your
friends, and I made things worse.

56
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,564
I'm used to putting on a brave face

57
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:36,373
when people bring their
troubles to the church.

58
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,377
And I find that they don't
just bring their troubles,

59
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,880
they bring their answers, too,
if you let them talk enough.

60
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,757
But...

61
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:52,472
what you're dealing with is so
far beyond my experience that...

62
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,519
Well...

63
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,430
all I can hope to do is

64
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:03,483
help keep your wounds
stitched and your head clear,

65
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,443
so you can be safe.

66
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,824
And I'll be more careful about
giving advice to the Devil.

67
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:17,414
And, occasionally, possibly,
I'll try to keep my mouth shut.

68
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,165
Could I get that in writing?

69
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,129
Look, I know you were
just trying to help.

70
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,841
Now, can I please see to those wounds?

71
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,493
Can I ask you something?

72
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,120
Yeah.

73
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:04,753
What if you stopped this
fight, took time to heal...

74
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,256
and let other people
like you go after Fisk?

75
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,011
This isn't their fight.

76
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,389
Fisk is my problem.

77
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,730
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

78
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,403
The problem is, he's always
five steps ahead of me.

79
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,282
I don't know if I can beat him.

80
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,329
And I don't know if I can beat
the man he sent to kill me.

81
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,708
You won't know for
certain till you find him.

82
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,172
I thought you were gonna keep
your thoughts to yourself.

83
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,343
- You really want me to do that?
- No.

84
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,433
If he was wearing a copy
of your Devil suit...

85
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,811
Well, he didn't get it at Sears.

86
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,772
How good a copy was it?

87
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,695
It was perfect.

88
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,250
Hello, Karen. It's
nice to see you again.

89
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,882
Was there anyone else
in the room named Karen?

90
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,635
Or on the whole Bulletin staff?

91
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,263
I'm advising my client
not to answer any questions

92
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,973
that treat her like an asshole.

93
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,060
There was not. He was talking to you.

94
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,566
- Why don't we watch it again? See...
- No.

95
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,820
- He was talking to me. That's true.
- Okay.

96
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,531
- Good.
- But I've never met him before.

97
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,596
Well, according to your own newspaper,

98
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:03,705
you've met Daredevil at least twice.

99
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,290
That psycho's not Daredevil.

100
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,167
I got a pretty good look at him, too.

101
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,835
Could have fooled me.

102
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,243
Do you think every fat guy

103
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:13,631
with a white beard and
red suit is Santa Claus?

104
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,426
If he comes down my chimney and
leaves presents under the tree.

105
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,762
Exactly. If he acted like Santa.
This guy doesn't act like Daredevil.

106
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,431
Based on your two encounters?

107
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,100
Dig a little deeper.

108
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,352
Why don't you read everything?

109
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,772
He doesn't kill people,
ever. It's not Daredevil.

110
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,441
So you keep saying.

111
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,569
Did you ever look into
Felix Manning? Red Lion Bank?

112
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,696
Any of the leads that
I dropped in your lap?

113
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,699
They're on my to-do list.

114
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,327
This is bullshit.

115
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,748
He dropped your name, Ms. Page.

116
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,083
Used your gun to murder someone.

117
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,585
And in this entire shitshow,

118
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,421
you're the one person he
didn't lay a finger on.

119
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,674
So I'm sorry that you
think that this is bullshit,

120
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,468
but something doesn't add up.

121
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,803
So we're gonna keep going
over this until it does.

122
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,015
It's not gonna add up until you
start asking the right questions.

123
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,975
How about this one?
Where's Matt Murdock?

124
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,055
Yet another fine example

125
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:09,896
of a question that's
besides the friggin' point!

126
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,773
You were supposed to
deliver him, Mr. Nelson.

127
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,025
But there are zero Matt
Murdocks in my custody.

128
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,361
Zero Jasper Evans left alive.

129
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,200
Think that's random? He kills
the one guy with dirt on Fisk.

130
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,869
You know that already? Is that
why you don't wanna go there?

131
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,954
- Karen...
- What?

132
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,755
That psycho in a suit did
Agent Nadeem a huge favor.

133
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,728
Now there's no one
left to tell the world

134
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:41,552
what a fool Fisk is making of the FBI.

135
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,933
Did you know Daredevil was
gonna attack the Bulletin?

136
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,736
Is that why you brought
your gun last night?

137
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,561
Okay. We're done here.

138
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,202
Are you okay?

139
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,373
No, I'm definitely not okay.

140
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,425
None of the people who own
those phones are okay, either.

141
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,552
- Come on. Let's go.
- No...

142
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,765
I don't get it. You... You almost
died. That doesn't leave a mark?

143
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,351
I don't have time to think about that.

144
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,396
Right now, Agent Nadeem's
got all my attention.

145
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,806
If he digs into Jasper Evans,

146
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:37,275
he'll know we're telling
the truth about Fisk.

147
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,694
Then he'll dig into
the rest of it. I hope.

148
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,460
I did this.

149
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,587
Wilson Fisk did this.

150
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,877
Evans wouldn't have come to the Bulletin

151
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:03,096
if I hadn't threatened his son.

152
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,053
This isn't on you.

153
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,347
And this isn't the time
to give up the fight.

154
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,475
- We need to find Matt...
- No. Um...

155
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,370
I'm gonna go to the hospital.

156
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,437
Are you hurt?

157
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,398
I'm the only one who wasn't.

158
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,445
Marci. I should take
this. She's worried.

159
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,372
Hey, babe.

160
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,749
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

161
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,629
I know. I'm sorry, it's just
been crazy. The time has...

162
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,964
Seema, I'm fine.

163
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,966
Really, I...

164
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,013
Seems, I wasn't even there.

165
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,475
I got there after it was all over.

166
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,519
That's right.

167
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,357
I'll be home tonight, okay?

168
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,195
Oh, shit. That's tonight?

169
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,076
No. No, no. Don't cancel. Um...

170
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,121
It'll be good to see the family.

171
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,373
And good for Sami, you know?

172
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:19,043
And let him know everything
really is all right.

173
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,465
I love you, too.

174
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,221
Where is he?

175
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,142
- Damn, it's cold out here.
- You got your hat?

176
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,309
I could get your hat.

177
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,728
No, Melvin, it's okay.
I'm in the office today.

178
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,813
Okay.

179
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,909
I made you cheese and pickles.

180
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,953
Thanks, love.

181
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,083
- You got your gun?
- Of course. Right here.

182
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,168
What's going on?

183
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,211
You've been acting strange all morning.

184
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,295
I...

185
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,047
worry about you.

186
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,508
Because I hang out with
paroled cons like you?

187
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,218
'Cause they're not like me.

188
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,982
I can take care of myself, big man.

189
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,099
You be good today. I'll
make asopao for dinner.

190
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,225
Okay.

191
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,729
Love you.

192
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,282
Betsy's your parole officer.

193
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,539
Please don't tell anyone.
It's against the rules.

194
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,125
I don't care what you
do with Betsy, Melvin.

195
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,419
You know why I'm here.

196
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,464
Fisk made me make the suit.

197
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,258
Did that man hurt you?

198
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,302
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,512
Who was he?

200
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,222
He didn't tell me his name.

201
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,517
But I can make you a new one...
to protect you against him.

202
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,269
- It'd be a fair fight.
- I don't want the suit anymore.

203
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,146
You don't like it?

204
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,940
I've outgrown what it stood for.

205
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,737
When you made my suit, there
were molds, measurements.

206
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,575
At the workshop, maybe
there's something.

207
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,161
I've been to the workshop.
It's been burned down.

208
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:21,499
Yeah, I burned it down, because
I didn't want to help Fisk, but...

209
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,834
he made me a new shop
and he threatened Betsy.

210
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:30,633
People died because
you helped him, Melvin.

211
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,345
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

212
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,933
Where is your new shop?

213
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,518
Foggy Bear?

214
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,816
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

215
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,651
When did you get here?

216
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,738
I tried to stay awake. I've
been watching the news all night.

217
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,197
Are you hurt?

218
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,284
Babe, talk to me.

219
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,704
I'm okay.

220
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm just tired.

221
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,591
Let's get you to bed.

222
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,597
Babe?

223
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,120
Jasper Evans.

224
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,499
Locked up in '91 on a
couple of murder two counts.

225
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,544
Seems he walked into a convenience
store, got talked to the wrong way,

226
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,213
ended up shooting an honest cashier

227
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,383
and a sweet old granny picking
up her Sunday Powerball ticket.

228
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,969
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

229
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,847
Warden, this lifer was
supposed to be serving

230
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,225
a year in the hole for
shanking Wilson Fisk.

231
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,767
Is that a question?

232
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,223
How could he be in the hole e

233
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:49,855
and get killed in a newspaper
office at the same time?

234
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,080
Some pencil-pusher must've
checked the wrong box

235
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:53,901
and let him out by mistake.

236
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,116
Look. I'm not trying to jam you up.

237
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,577
I'm just trying to nail
down how he got out.

238
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,497
And who might have wanted him dead.

239
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,126
I need answers, Warden.

240
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,797
You got nothing? Seriously?

241
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,302
I want my lawyer.

242
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,978
I talked to the Bulletin reporter.

243
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,231
Jasper Evans was going to say
that Fisk staged his own shanking.

244
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,066
He had him released
from prison as payback.

245
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,151
Jesus.

246
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,154
Tell me the warden disputes that.

247
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,489
He's more concerned with
covering his own ass.

248
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,159
- He's lawyered up.
- Oh, shit.

249
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,122
It's all hearsay. I mean,
Evans might have been lying.

250
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,957
And maybe he was telling the truth.

251
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,293
We gotta kick this up the chain.

252
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,961
- Who are you calling?
- The ADIC.

253
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,174
And tell him what? We
don't know all the facts.

254
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,510
Except there's a damn good chance
that Fisk is manipulating us.

255
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,395
If it's true,

256
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,650
every asshole we put
away with Fisk's help

257
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:15,566
will be back on the street by morning.

258
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,196
Everything we've done,
the people we've lost,

259
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,822
it will all be for nothing.

260
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,158
You can't unring that bell.

261
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,368
Just give me a chance to
figure out if it's true.

262
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,578
How?

263
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,289
I need two days.

264
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,708
You want a pony, too?

265
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,336
Just let me get the facts.

266
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,047
If Fisk really did play us,

267
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,509
we'll bury that son of a bitch together.

268
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,807
Wow.

269
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,144
I don't know what got into me.

270
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,312
It's okay.

271
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,774
I mean, it was way,
way better than okay.

272
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,109
Like, way better.

273
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,363
I mean, I get it.

274
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,574
After what you went through last night.

275
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,204
I was convinced I was gonna die.

276
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,707
The last thing I remember
thinking was, "Not yet."

277
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,876
Oh, you must've been so scared.

278
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,754
More than I've ever
been in my entire life.

279
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,655
But there was something else beneath it.

280
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:24,927
This feeling of being unsettled.

281
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,931
Important things left undone.

282
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,435
Marry me.

283
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,064
- Stop.
- I'm serious.

284
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,651
- Let's go to the courthouse right now.
- Foggy Bear, slow down.

285
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,237
I love you, Marci, and I'm
pretty sure that you love me, too.

286
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,822
I do love you.

287
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,535
But when you propose, I want
it to be from your heart.

288
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,203
Not from this.

289
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,171
Shit.

290
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,675
I'm gonna be late for my deposition.

291
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,181
Go. Shower. I'll pick this up.

292
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,588
What the hell?

293
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,760
Think about what Amber
would have wanted. You know?

294
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,682
They want to take her
off of life support.

295
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,684
I'll let you know what we decide.

296
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,227
Okay. I'm so sorry.

297
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,695
I'm...

298
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,822
All surgical residents to pre-op.

299
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,908
All surgical residents to pre-op.

300
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,246
Chief ortho resident to ER.
Chief ortho resident to ER.

301
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,123
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

302
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,253
How are you feeling?

303
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,799
I'm full of Percocet.

304
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:28,926
Jell-O.

305
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,553
Rage.

306
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,305
Uh...

307
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,724
Amber?

308
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,017
Oh, she's on...

309
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:44,274
She's brain-dead. Just, uh,
machines keeping her alive.

310
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,528
- It wasn't worth it.
- Karen...

311
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,029
Look, three people died.

312
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,615
Why? Because I had to pick a fight?

313
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,284
I'm pretty sure that's
what we're supposed to do.

314
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,663
Sometimes, we get our asses kicked.

315
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,999
Could you get me the
water? It's over there.

316
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:05,462
Don't think you have some proprietary
claim over sticking it to Fisk.

317
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,216
You know, this fight belongs to
every person in Hell's Kitchen.

318
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:13,595
And I'm one of them, so
I intend to keep fighting.

319
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,080
We're gonna go to print today, tomorrow,

320
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,850
and the next day and the next day.

321
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:26,025
Here. I want you to write down
everything you know about Daredevil.

322
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,152
His connection to Fisk.

323
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,697
The man who attacked us last
night, it wasn't Daredevil.

324
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,410
Who was it, then?

325
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,913
I don't know.

326
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,751
But you know it wasn't Daredevil.

327
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,426
Karen, do you know who Daredevil is?

328
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,184
Don't ask me that. Please.

329
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,351
Why not?

330
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:10,903
Karen, if you know something,
you've gotta tell me right now.

331
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,824
I can't.

332
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:22,581
Some piece of shit attacked
my people, in my house!

333
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,919
And if you know anything,

334
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,714
anything that will get me
closer to finding out who he is,

335
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,134
then, God damn it, you
are going to tell me!

336
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:40,099
Or you can go clean out your desk.

337
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,903
Why is the suit here?

338
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,658
That's not the one he
wore. Fisk made me make two.

339
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,784
Why?

340
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,914
- Ask him yourself.
- What are you doing?

341
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,709
I have to go now. He said.

342
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,419
- Don't do this.
- I don't have a choice.

343
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,400
- He'll come for Betsy.
- Why'd he ask you to trap me here?

344
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:54,232
Is he coming? Tell me who wore the suit!

345
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,936
I will find him. I
will put an end to this.

346
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,343
I can't. Fisk will know.
And he'll hurt Betsy.

347
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,429
If you really loved
her, you'd cut her loose.

348
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,098
This life doesn't work with Betsys.

349
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,228
I can't let you leave!

350
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,496
- Someone's coming.
- I'm not supposed to be here.

351
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,553
It's the FBI, Melvin.
Why would Fisk send...

352
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,807
They're supposed to
find you with the suit.

353
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,645
Oh, God.

354
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,274
He's framing me for
being Daredevil. Oh, God.

355
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,027
Melvin, come on, he's tricking you.

356
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,446
Please. Betsy's all I have.

357
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,574
Once Fisk has me, he will kill you both.

358
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,454
- Oh, man.
- You gotta help me, or Betsy's dead.

359
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,914
Who did you make the suit for?

360
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,292
He never told me his name...

361
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,919
but he was an FBI agent.

362
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,171
How do you know that?

363
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,633
He was talking about it
with the man who brought him.

364
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,760
Breach. Breach. Breach.

365
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,389
FBI! Don't move!

366
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,517
Go! Go! Go!

367
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,560
Stop fighting, or we'll shoot!

368
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,612
Hands behind your head.

369
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,300
- Please! I gotta get to her!
- On your knees.

370
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,325
On your knees!

371
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,164
Betsy!

372
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,042
He'll hurt Betsy!

373
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,467
- He asleep?
- Been in bed all night.

374
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,630
I need to talk to him.

375
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:31,098
- You want company?
- No. I got it.

376
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,188
Potter's in custody.

377
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,608
Should we alter his
situation or his girlfriend's?

378
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,692
No.

379
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,363
He's irrelevant now.

380
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,576
Where is Poindexter?

381
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,120
Laying low, as ordered.

382
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,415
Although, I'm concerned
about his mental stability.

383
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,499
Yeah.

384
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,920
I've demanded a lot from him.

385
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,547
You keep an eye on him.

386
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,759
But let him be for now.

387
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,973
We need to talk.

388
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,059
You're working late.

389
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,730
Shouldn't you be with your
family? Seema, isn't it?

390
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,899
Say her name again and see what happens.

391
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,865
What can I help you with?

392
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,409
Help me.

393
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,498
You know, you remind me of
someone I knew growing up.

394
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,249
Jack Kem.

395
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,504
Yeah, but everyone knew him as Jiggy.

396
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:29,424
You know, Jiggy lived in a
two-family house all by himself.

397
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,469
It was practically a mansion to me.

398
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,846
But Jiggy was a helper, too.

399
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,350
He was always helping
out folks on the block.

400
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,563
Annie the single mom needs
a new car. Jiggy's got it.

401
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:47,609
The Hoffmans are desperate
for rent. No problem.

402
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,155
Ten-year-old me thought
this guy was a hero.

403
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,328
But it turned out Jiggy had
hidden ten kilos of heroin

404
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,996
in the trunk of Annie's sedan.

405
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,500
Another five in the Hoffman baby's room.

406
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,297
Guess who the cops arrested when
they tracked down that powder?

407
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,096
I've seen your kind of help before.

408
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:26,064
Have a little faith in
me, Special Agent Nadeem.

409
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,694
I'm a better man than Jiggy.

410
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,113
This...

411
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,324
All of this...

412
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,497
This was my price,

413
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,793
which I was plain about at
the start of our relationship.

414
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,046
And you have paid it.

415
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,219
I need to know.

416
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,763
Right now.

417
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:06,146
You let Jasper Evans out of prison
to pay him back for shanking you?

418
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:12,611
Your desperation diminishes
you, Special Agent.

419
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,280
Good night.

420
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:13,171
"The Hero of Hell's Kitchen
Feeds a Simpleton to the Feds."

421
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,092
Won't that make a hell of a
headline for tomorrow's Bulletin?

422
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,844
Melvin made his choice.

423
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,015
Yet you did hesitate before you left.

424
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,644
Were you waiting for a messenger
from the Lord to stop you,

425
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,355
like he stopped Abraham
from killing his son?

426
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,067
Were you disappointed
no messenger arrived...

427
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,520
or relieved that you didn't
have to risk your life

428
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:40,156
for a weak-minded criminal?

429
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,503
You're not strong enough to
beat the man I sent for you.

430
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,797
You're not smart enough to beat me.

431
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,134
You couldn't do it alone. You
couldn't do it with your friends.

432
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,012
Your father never knew when to lay down.

433
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,807
He was too proud.

434
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,101
You will die the same way.

435
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,374
Please, Betsy, don't do me like this.

436
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,586
I wasn't the one who violated
parole. You did this to yourself.

437
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,882
Betsy.

438
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:43,720
Don't. I'm not here to hurt
you. I'm here about Melvin.

439
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,099
Melvin Potter?

440
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,809
He's been arrested.

441
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:50,894
Bullshit.

442
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,021
He's not gonna tell anyone
about your relationship,

443
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,939
but that's not what
you need to worry about.

444
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,400
You need to worry about Wilson Fisk.

445
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:00,236
Oh, shit. Damn it, Melvin.

446
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,114
Fisk doesn't leave loose
ends. He will kill you.

447
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:07,786
Don't go home. Don't go
back to work. Leave town.

448
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,579
What about Melvin? Is he okay?

449
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,039
You can't help Melvin.

450
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,625
He made his bed when he
went back to work for Fisk.

451
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,505
You're a cold piece of work, aren't you?

452
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,716
Melvin told me about the
Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

453
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,718
He thought you were a hero.

454
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,972
I told him assholes like you and
Fisk are cut from the same cloth

455
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,308
and both of you would
take advantage of Melvin

456
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,977
because he has a good
heart and a trusting way!

457
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,562
You've been warned, Betsy.

458
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,606
You want to live?

459
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,690
Run.

460
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:53,623
Foggy?

461
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,755
Foggy, baby, are you okay?

462
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,424
Because I don't think you're okay.

463
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:04,967
Oh.

464
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,970
I'm... I'm fine.

465
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,183
I think I know what Fisk is up to.

466
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,155
Hello?

467
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:14,245
- Hi, Dad. It's me.
- Karen? Good Lord.

468
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:19,334
I heard something on the news.
That wasn't where you work, was it?

469
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,420
Yeah. Yeah, it was. I'm okay, though.

470
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:29,969
I was thinking that maybe I could
come home for a little while.

471
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,434
I don't know. I'm afraid
the timing is not great.

472
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,565
Yeah. Of course. I get it.

473
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,151
But you can call anytime, all right?

474
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,992
Dad...

475
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,246
I was just trying to do
the right thing. It just...

476
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,374
It went all wrong.

477
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,379
That's what you do, Karen.

478
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,091
Good night.

479
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,782
I'm not asking for prisoner files.

480
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,119
All I want is footage from
the security cameras. Copies.

481
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,413
I'll even pay for them.

482
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,543
We're supposed to be
on the same side here.

483
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,005
All I want to do is see exactly
what happened when Fisk got shanked.

484
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,844
Well, you have him call me as
soon as he gets in. Understand?

485
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,511
I'll...

486
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:56,764
Asshole.

487
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,783
Surprise!

488
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,411
Wow.

489
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,497
Congratulations on
your promotion, nuuri.

490
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,582
Thanks, everyone.

491
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,876
Hey, bud. Come here.

492
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,840
Sorry I'm late.

493
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,935
Ray, you make every single
person in this room so proud.

494
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:47,023
Proud of the man you are
and who you strive to be.

495
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,358
For the example you set for our son.

496
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,987
For the husband and friend we adore.

497
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,698
And for being the man who
hogs more blankets at night

498
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,326
than is humanly possible.

499
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,915
But even with that, you've always
been the person to warm my heart.

500
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,669
Congratulations on your
well-deserved promotion.

501
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,314
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

502
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,298
- I love you.
- I love you.

503
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,382
Eww.

504
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,427
Way to kill the moment, buddy.

505
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,555
Mom, we're out of soda.

506
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,933
There's plenty in the fridge downstairs.

507
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,059
I'll get it.

508
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,228
I need a moment with you first.

509
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,733
What?

510
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,739
- I told you, everything is fine.
- You lied to me.

511
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,535
I called you, afraid for
your life, and you lied.

512
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,788
I have to hear from Annie
Wellers what really happened?

513
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,958
That that murderer attacked
you and that you shot him?

514
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,876
- Seems...
- I have to hear it from her?

515
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,840
- I didn't want you to worry.
- Well, I am worried.

516
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:57,718
I'm worried what this job
is doing to you, to us.

517
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,304
What's that supposed to mean?

518
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,266
I will always have your
back. To them. To everyone.

519
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,394
But I'm not an idiot.

520
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,314
- I didn't say you are.
- When you lie to my face, you do.

521
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,700
You're right.

522
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,122
I'm just trying to keep
everything together.

523
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,543
I don't want to screw any of this up.

524
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,715
I worked so hard for this, for us.

525
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,679
How... How can I fix this?

526
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,853
You can start with telling me the truth.

527
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,108
And by getting more drinks.

528
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,563
I didn't come here to fight.

529
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:42,865
Who are you?

530
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,618
I'm Daredevil.

531
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,703
The real one.

532
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,848
- You don't look like...
- I buried the red suit.

533
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,727
The man who attacked the
Bulletin, he resurrected it.

534
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,095
You do, however, match
the description of a guy

535
00:46:17,096 --> 00:46:18,651
who's been tuning up FBI agents.

536
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,330
Which is the last thing I ever wanted,

537
00:46:20,331 --> 00:46:23,155
but you people haven't
left me any choice.

538
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,096
If you'd just wake the hell up

539
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:28,411
instead of playing
right into Fisk's hands.

540
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:32,164
He's using you, and I think you know it.

541
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,960
Now, I heard you confront
that psycho at the Bulletin.

542
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,005
I heard you try to stop him,
and he almost killed you, too.

543
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,299
So let me ask you this, Agent Nadeem...

544
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,677
Who do you think is the danger here?

545
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,429
Me...

546
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,514
or him?

547
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,021
Dad, Mom wants to know where you are.

548
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,065
Don't come down, Sami.

549
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,360
I dropped a beer, there's glass.

550
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:07,074
Tell your mom I need a couple
of minutes to clean it up.

551
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,159
Okay.

552
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:15,833
Let's say I believe the guy
that just broke into my house.

553
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,294
Let's just say that.

554
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,797
What do you got?

555
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,427
The man who attacked the
Bulletin dressed as Daredevil...

556
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,555
he's in the FBI.

557
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,482
Keep talking.

558
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:51,990
