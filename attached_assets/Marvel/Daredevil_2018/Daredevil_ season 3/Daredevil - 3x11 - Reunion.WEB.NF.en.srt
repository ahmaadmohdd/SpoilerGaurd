2
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,911
Help me!

3
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,544
He's back at the church!

4
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:34,664
All units, 10-34.

5
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:36,847
Daredevil reported at Clinton Church.

6
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,181
Mobilize level three.

7
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,602
Dispatch code 11.
Emergency services en route.

8
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,569
Dispatch 10-54 at Clinton Church.

9
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,356
This is a multiple-casualty incident.

10
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,114
What the hell did you do?

11
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,949
Get over there.

12
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,411
You need to assume command
of the scene from the NYPD.

13
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,289
Daredevil is a federal fugitive.

14
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,712
Lock down the church.
Lock down the entire area.

15
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,797
We cannot let them escape.

16
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,176
God damn it, I asked you a
question. What have you done?

17
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,720
It's not done.

18
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,473
We are not done.

19
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,730
Matt?

20
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,733
Matt, come on, you gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Please wake up.

21
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,109
Wake up. Hey.

22
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,862
- Karen?
- Can you sit up?

23
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,946
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,366
We gotta go.

25
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,993
- Where is he?
- I don't know. I think he got away.

26
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,665
No.

27
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,709
Jesus. Father...

28
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,961
He killed him. Karen, he killed him.

29
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,922
I know. I know. I'm
sorry, but you gotta run.

30
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,341
- Cops are outside. You have to go now.
- We have to run.

31
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,302
No. No, Matt, I'm gonna stay here,
and I'll tell the police everything.

32
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:01,682
Karen, the man in my suit,
his name is Ben Poindexter.

33
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,101
He's an FBI agent. He works for Fisk.

34
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,353
So does Agent Nadeem.

35
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,230
They find you, they kill you.

36
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,596
Has anyone got a coat or a blanket?

37
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,764
He killed him.

38
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,516
- Who?
- Daredevil.

39
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,351
He killed Father Lantom.

40
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,777
Who's in command here?

41
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,697
I am. Captain Strieber, 15th Precinct.

42
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,826
Nadeem, FBI.

43
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,454
Daredevil is our suspect.
I'm assuming command.

44
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,831
The suspect is still at large.

45
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,500
We have civilians down on the inside,

46
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,644
the church and surrounding
buildings are on lockdown.

47
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,337
How far out is ESU?

48
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,630
Excuse me?

49
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,258
I saw Daredevil leaving the church.

50
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,676
When?

51
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,096
Moments before you all arrived.

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,765
He headed that way.

53
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,933
Well, that lines up.

54
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,644
We have two additional DOA's
in an alley a block from here.

55
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,730
I'm aware of that. Daredevil
came back to the church.

56
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,608
I saw him myself.

57
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,611
We're looking for three suspects.

58
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:24,866
Daredevil and his two accomplices,
and a white female. Blonde, 5'9".

59
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,160
Her name is Karen Page.

60
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,784
Matt, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

61
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:56,940
Why didn't you run?

62
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,900
Run? How could I run?

63
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,945
God. Karen, if you get caught,
all of this was for nothing.

64
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,446
Crypt gate is locked!

65
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,491
FBI team is on the scene. Fall back.

66
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,250
It won't hold them
forever. They'll be back.

67
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,379
Matt, you're right.

68
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,506
You're right, it's my fault.

69
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,843
I deserved the baton, not Father Lantom.

70
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,219
I should never have come here.

71
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,680
Why did you come?

72
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,017
Because Fisk knows who you are.

73
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,352
I wanted to warn you.

74
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,812
That's what this is about?

75
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,982
Yeah. He already knew that.

76
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,485
Oh, God. Karen, I had him.

77
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,530
I just gave up my one shot
to come here to save you.

78
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,743
What do you mean, you had him?

79
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,953
I was in his penthouse.

80
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,205
Waiting for him.

81
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,458
That was it.

82
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,794
It was...

83
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,129
... the moment.

84
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,300
What do you think you were gonna do?

85
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,344
Shh!

86
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,347
He's back.

87
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,643
Poindexter is upstairs,
and he's with Nadeem.

88
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,273
Clear! Clear! Clear!

89
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,358
Stay frosty.

90
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,652
They're still in here somewhere.

91
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,990
What are you gonna do when you get him?

92
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,083
I did not sign up for this shit.

93
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,960
Yes, you did.

94
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,879
All clear! This room is secure.

95
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,633
Copy.

96
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,052
Search the living quarters.

97
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,478
Please wait here.

98
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,828
Eternal Father, I beg you...

99
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,165
welcome Paul into your holy embrace...

100
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,421
and do not punish him
for my stupid decisions,

101
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:30,802
for my weakness, my sin, and for
what I have brought unto us all.

102
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,182
Sister, we need access to every
area of the church grounds.

103
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,267
Now.

104
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,978
I'm sorry, Sister.

105
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,065
I know you're in mourning,
but we need your help.

106
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,621
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,376
Oh, Lord.

108
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,962
Sister, step aside.

109
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,047
Cut it.

110
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,705
- Clear!
- Clear!

111
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,105
- Shit.
- Clear!

112
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,835
What about the rectory?

113
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,422
There's also a door to
the roof. It's that way.

114
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,382
Let me show you.

115
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,305
Okay.

116
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,516
They're gone.

117
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,436
All right. They're gone.

118
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,570
I guess we'll just wait here until...

119
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,447
until they leave.

120
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,871
Why is Fisk hunting you?

121
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,957
Had a plan.

122
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,293
Went to go see him.

123
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,670
You went to see Fisk?

124
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,882
Yeah, I thought maybe
I could provoke him,

125
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,093
turn his emotions against him.

126
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,636
To what end?

127
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,640
Make him attack me in front of the FBI.

128
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,602
Jesus, Karen.

129
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,228
Yeah.

130
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,941
Don't worry, it didn't work. He...

131
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,529
caught me off guard, asked me
how long I'd known your secret.

132
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,950
I swear I tried, but he just...

133
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,911
He read it in my face.

134
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,292
You tried to outsmart Fisk?
Provoke him into making a mistake?

135
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,795
Fine, okay, right. You're
right. I was an idiot. Sorry.

136
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,675
No, you were brave.

137
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,349
Anyway, he didn't take the bait.

138
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,309
What was the bait?

139
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,689
I told him a secret of my own.

140
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,997
You remember that friend
he had that got shot?

141
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:29,958
Uh...

142
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,960
Wesley?

143
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,006
I killed him.

144
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,010
That's why he sent Poindexter after me.

145
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:46,015
- I was stupid and...
- and reckless,

146
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,726
and now Father Lantom
is dead because of it.

147
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,270
Because of... because of me.

148
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,605
Why didn't you tell me?

149
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,068
I don't know. You...

150
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,409
You always, uh, treated me like I was...

151
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,370
innocent.

152
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,543
That was nice... It was nice
that you thought of me like that.

153
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,218
What were you gonna do to Fisk?

154
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,679
Kill him.

155
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,268
- Your turn to judge me.
- No.

156
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,437
No, I'm not. I get it.

157
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,105
Trust me.

158
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,068
Just makes me, uh...

159
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,323
It makes me sad for you.

160
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,908
It has to be done, Karen.

161
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,786
Okay, you're gonna have
to listen to me here.

162
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,331
Okay, listen to me.

163
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,586
Okay, I never told you
why I left Vermont, right?

164
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,837
Why I left home.

165
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,426
Okay, see, there was a car crash.

166
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,845
And...

167
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,975
Um, I killed my brother, uh,
because I was... I was high

168
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,037
- and I was drunk and I was angry...
- Jesus, Karen.

169
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,621
... and I shouldn't have been
driving, and it changed everything.

170
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,318
No matter what I do...

171
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,906
there is no atoning for that.

172
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,159
Okay? There is no way
to come back from it.

173
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:32,246
What if... it is the way back?

174
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,123
For me?

175
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,961
I can't let Fisk go.

176
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,303
Killing anyone...

177
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,972
even Fisk...

178
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,938
it will change everything that you...

179
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,274
that you feel about yourself.

180
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,437
For the past two years,

181
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,857
ever since his unjust conviction
on racketeering charges,

182
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,124
our client has maintained his innocence

183
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,695
and fought to clear his good name.

184
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,074
One hour ago, the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals

185
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,827
overturned the
conviction of Wilson Fisk.

186
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,538
Having seen the proof
that they were wrong,

187
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:00,501
the Department of Justice will
not be going forward with charges.

188
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:07,383
As of tonight, we are proud to
announce that justice has prevailed

189
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,721
and Wilson Fisk is
once again a free man.

190
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,817
I know that most of you find
this difficult to accept.

191
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,864
That's only because
you've been manipulated...

192
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:34,535
poisoned into believing the
news media's fake story...

193
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,329
that I am evil,

194
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,789
that I am a criminal.

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,710
Quite the opposite is true.

196
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,214
Because I challenge the system...

197
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:52,261
because I've told the truth and tried
to make this city a better place,

198
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,681
the people in power
decided to tear me down...

199
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,394
to tear me down with false allegations.

200
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,440
They sent someone to frame me.

201
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,525
Daredevil.

202
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,445
The killer who's now
showing his true colors,

203
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:15,076
who has tried to murder people in
newspaper offices and churches...

204
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,871
attacking our sacred institutions.

205
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,874
Believe me.

206
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,713
Daredevil is our true public enemy.

207
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,893
Agent Nadeem?

208
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,770
Detective Mahoney.

209
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,940
I'm taking over the murder
investigation on our side.

210
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,986
Great. We'll share what
we've got ASAP. I promise.

211
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,630
Thanks. But between you and me,

212
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:54,824
there's something off about all of this.

213
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,868
What's that?

214
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,280
Well, a number of
witnesses claim Daredevil

215
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:02,206
was trying to kill Karen Page.

216
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,710
And your people are making
her out to be his accomplice.

217
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,755
There's more to this story
than you're aware of, Detective.

218
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,010
Thanks for bringing it to my
attention, but this is our crime scene.

219
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,345
We'll let you know if we need anything.

220
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,321
Dex, this is getting out of control.

221
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,989
Someone needs to call Kingpin.

222
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,658
Dex?

223
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,452
Hello?

224
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,871
Yeah?

225
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,456
What?

226
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,792
I'm saying we should
get in front of this.

227
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,252
Someone needs to call Kingpin.

228
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,129
And say what?

229
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,714
That we failed?

230
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,423
"We"?

231
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,968
There something that you
want to say to me, Arinori?

232
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,763
Hey, this isn't helping.

233
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,684
Dex, they're in the wind.

234
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,604
And we're not gonna find 'em tonight.

235
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,399
I'm gonna release the ESU and
open the scene to forensics.

236
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,234
No. No way.

237
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,488
You get the NYPD to go to
every house in the neighborhood.

238
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,156
Door to door.

239
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,867
We do not stop until we find them.

240
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,119
Dex, they're gone.

241
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,457
Fine, call it off.

242
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,542
And you call Kingpin

243
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,629
and tell him you're the reason
that Karen Page is still breathing,

244
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,922
that you gave up.

245
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,844
Okay. A few more hours.

246
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,943
Sister, do you mind if I ask
you a couple of questions?

247
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,489
Do you know the suspects?

248
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,333
As far as I'm aware, the only
one you've identified by name

249
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,661
is Karen Page.

250
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,288
And, yes, she and I are acquainted.

251
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,708
Do you know where she might have gone?

252
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,295
I thought you believed the suspects
were still hiding in the church.

253
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,927
We do. I do. I meant where
on the church grounds.

254
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,806
May I ask you a personal
question, Agent Nadeem?

255
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,058
Okay.

256
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,311
Do you consider yourself a moral person?

257
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,440
I like to think so.

258
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,317
I try to be.

259
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,029
My good friend died here tonight,

260
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,199
protecting Karen Page from evil.

261
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,388
If you're the kind of
man you claim to be,

262
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:51,500
do you really want to help it find her?

263
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,477
Thank you.

264
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,109
What? What is it?

265
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,996
Thank God.

266
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,416
It's not safe for you to come out yet.

267
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah, we know. I can hear 'em.

268
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,426
I can come back with food,

269
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,262
but in the meantime, you
should get cleaned up.

270
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,848
We have fresh clothes.

271
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,351
Donations for the poor.

272
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,104
Uh, thank you.

273
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,569
Uh, Sister...

274
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,950
for what it's worth, I'm so
sorry. I shouldn't have come here.

275
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,160
This is not your fault.

276
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,789
Father Lantom didn't deserve this.

277
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,875
Few of us get what we deserve.

278
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,921
These should fit you.

279
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,227
I'll come back as soon as
I can. You'll be safe here.

280
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,104
No, we won't.

281
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,358
They brought in search dogs.

282
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,237
Search over here.

283
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,530
Track. Track.

284
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,619
Not me, fellas. The bad guys.

285
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,663
All right.

286
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,168
Wait.

287
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,838
Tell them what you saw.

288
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,173
- The man in black is next door.
- What?

289
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,926
I saw him go in, slam
the door. It was him...

290
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,928
- Where?
- The orphanage.

291
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,264
Please tell me we got
all the kids out of there.

292
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,347
I don't know.

293
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,933
Come on, let's move.

294
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,733
Yeah.

295
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,818
They're taking the dogs next door.

296
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,945
Buys us some time.

297
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,040
Jesus, Matt.

298
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,883
Couldn't put it on in front of her?

299
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,762
You know, something just kinda hit me.

300
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,558
Watching you... wall
yourself off from her.

301
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,186
You know?

302
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,732
Uh, yeah. She told me.

303
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,862
Said she felt ashamed
about what she did.

304
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:12,701
And that... everyone you
ever cared about left you.

305
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,346
- Can we not do this now?
- Is that why you

306
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,431
- insist on doing everything alone?
- I don't insist...

307
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,082
- Pushing Foggy and me away.
- I'm not.

308
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,726
I told you, I'm tryin' to protect you...

309
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,627
I think you're trying
to protect yourself.

310
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,420
You wanna talk about this right now?

311
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,544
There are people tryin' to
kill us, and you wanna...

312
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,508
Just shut up for a second, Matt, okay?

313
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,136
Look, I was never gonna
leave you up there,

314
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,257
and I'm not leaving you now.

315
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,888
Neither will Foggy.

316
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,183
Despite the fact that you've
been a complete asshole to him,

317
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,227
he'd still follow you over a cliff.

318
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,563
Yeah.

319
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,652
Okay. So, what, you agree?

320
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,445
That could actually work.

321
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,658
I don't get it. What could work?

322
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,329
Foggy.

323
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,960
Mr. Fisk's people said you had to
call a press conference and read it.

324
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,628
Jesus.

325
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,047
You're calling him "Mr. Fisk" now?

326
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,094
"I was acting under duress

327
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:16,223
when I falsely and publicly accused
Wilson Fisk of criminal activities.

328
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,728
Daredevil threatened
the lives of my family,

329
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:24,982
but in light of recent events, I
now see that I did the wrong thing,

330
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,234
that I must stand up for what's right."

331
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,278
- I can't say this.
- You have to.

332
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,696
It's complete bullshit.

333
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,865
You know what's bullshit, Foggy?

334
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,769
The fact that me and Mom and Dad

335
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,302
are caught up in this
in the first place.

336
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,766
The only reason these people
tricked us into that bank loan...

337
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,956
You knew it was fraud
when you signed it.

338
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:45,919
Okay, yeah. But it only happened
because Fisk wanted to get to you.

339
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,715
Everything that's happened, the
suppliers cuttin' us off, the loan,

340
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,218
all that shit happened because you
wanted to be the big-time lawyer

341
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,262
instead of hangin' around
here with us losers.

342
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,765
Come on. That's not fair.

343
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:01,018
No, it's not. None of it is.

344
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,979
We didn't have any say in this, Foggy.

345
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,690
You went and pissed off the
biggest mob boss in the city,

346
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,094
but we're the ones paying for it.

347
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,277
Or we will if you don't do what he says.

348
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:16,492
If I read that statement to
the press, Fisk wins, Theo.

349
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,660
He's already won, Fogg.

350
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,537
Now, do the right thing.

351
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,414
The right thing for your family.

352
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,008
Hello?

353
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,553
Matt?

354
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:41,100
The deputy AG has ruled that you
continue to be a valuable DOJ asset

355
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,185
who deserves ongoing protection.

356
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,814
Because they're terrified of
the PR hit if you get killed.

357
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,441
Thank you, Agent Hattley.

358
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,735
That will be all.

359
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,035
Well, where is Vanessa?

360
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,372
In the air. Her plane
took off an hour ago.

361
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,341
Then there's only one
thing left for me to do,

362
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,253
which, apparently, I have to do myself.

363
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,756
We doubled the offer, threw in
incentives, but the owner wouldn't sell.

364
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,466
Not at any price.

365
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,426
Then I'll visit her in person.

366
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,388
I'll make a more compelling offer.

367
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,314
All the way up to the rectory, right?

368
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,774
That's what they said.

369
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,246
Sorry, sir, this is an active...

370
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,540
Hey, are you Foggy Nelson?

371
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,834
Guilty as charged, Officer...

372
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,253
- "Minelli."
- It's an honor to meet you.

373
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,855
I signed our union's endorsement letter.

374
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:54,506
I hope you kick Blake Tower's ass.

375
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,217
With people like you backing
me up, how could I not?

376
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,291
Hey, listen, I'm here to
talk to Detective Mahoney.

377
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,555
You think you could...

378
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,900
Move!

379
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,243
Nelson?

380
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,704
What the hell are you doing?

381
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,873
Agent Nadeem, pleasure to see you again.

382
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,958
I asked you a question.
What are you doing here?

383
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:35,756
You know, just observing the hard
work of our men and women in blue.

384
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,050
That's some weak bullshitting.
You wanna try that again?

385
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,927
Okay. You caught me.

386
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,888
Truth is, I'm killing time.

387
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,600
Killing time for what?

388
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,688
Why do you keep looking at her?

389
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,857
Because I need to kill
a few more seconds.

390
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,237
Okay, I'm good.

391
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,239
Agent Nadeem, I'm here for my client.

392
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,990
- Your...
- Client.

393
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,371
Don't shoot! She's unarmed.

394
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,957
This is why I'm here.
To surrender my client.

395
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,208
Good.

396
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,503
To the NYPD.

397
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,298
Karen Page, you are under arrest.

398
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,883
Cuff her.

399
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,762
What the hell are you doing?

400
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,930
She's ours, Detective.

401
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,181
Like hell.

402
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,641
She's a federal suspect.

403
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,518
She's a suspected accomplice to murder.

404
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,644
That's state law.

405
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,729
And she's here to surrender to the NYPD.

406
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,210
- Shut up.
- I'm saying, as the only attorney here,

407
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,210
- I could help clear...
- Put a sock in it, Nelson.

408
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,903
These feds know the
law. She's our suspect.

409
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,030
They can file a writ and
maybe talk to her later.

410
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,368
I will not let you take her.

411
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,828
You and what army?

412
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,248
Hey, we're on the same team here.

413
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,794
Detective, a word?

414
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:00,132
What part of "our crime
scene" do you not understand?

415
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,551
Ben, we're all cut up
about what happened here.

416
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,638
A word. Please.

417
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,316
You need to stand your people down.

418
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,860
Listen to me very carefully.

419
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,824
If we take Karen Page into custody,

420
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:25,042
she'll be dead before she reaches HQ.

421
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,283
No, don't react.

422
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,869
Just get her the hell
away from us. We clear?

423
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,912
Crystal.

424
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,751
Detective Mahoney will
take custody of the suspect.

425
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,877
Bullshit!

426
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,230
We'll have her back in an
hour. Hattley will pull strings.

427
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,257
- No.
- You can't kill her here anyway.

428
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,012
You messed up, Ray.

429
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,141
You really... really messed up.

430
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,298
Mrs. Falb. My name is...

431
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,716
I know who you are.

432
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,177
Take off your shoes.

433
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,852
It's beautiful.

434
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,021
It certainly is.

435
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,856
It's peaceful and so...

436
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,360
It's been through quite
a bit over the years.

437
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,905
But it's home now.

438
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:56,665
I hope you're not here to
offer me more money for it.

439
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,252
- Would it change your mind?
- It would not.

440
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,048
I understand you became
aware of the painting

441
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,260
when it was taken away
from me by the government.

442
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,428
Yes.

443
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,264
Ironic, I suppose.

444
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:18,687
It was a government that took
it from my family in 1943.

445
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,816
So, then, you are particularly
suited to understanding my situation.

446
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,653
The painting was given to
me by the woman that I love.

447
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,030
When I'm with it, I am with her.

448
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,032
She must be an amazing woman.

449
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,617
Yes.

450
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:38,123
Yeah, she's given me much in
the short time I've had with her.

451
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:42,669
She brought focus to my
life. Love, if you will.

452
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,714
This painting is bound up in that love.

453
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,676
It's part of me. It's part of us.

454
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:55,265
My years on this
earth... have taught me...

455
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,935
there is nothing more
important than love.

456
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,064
I didn't have much of it.

457
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:09,237
And when it was offered to me,
I was too afraid to accept it.

458
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,531
I understand.

459
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,203
Well, then, you will
understand me when I say this:

460
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,916
that painting was not hers to give.

461
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,668
She was unaware of the provenance.

462
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,712
She gave it with love.

463
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:30,008
It was not taken with love.

464
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,262
I was a toddler when the
wolves came to our door.

465
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,099
The gestapo demanded everything we had.

466
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,936
Including that painting.

467
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,438
My father fought them...

468
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,817
... and they shot him in front of us.

469
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:55,200
Do you know what it's like to see
your father take his last breath

470
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,578
on the floor in front of you?

471
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,125
As they marched my family
across Poland to the ghetto...

472
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,092
my mother went hungry to feed us.

473
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,470
But of the seven members of my family,

474
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,683
we were the only ones who survived.

475
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,852
I am deeply sorry for
everything you've suffered.

476
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:31,570
This painting is my connection
to the people I love.

477
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,200
I know who you are, Mr. Fisk.

478
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,703
You are a wolf, too.

479
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:47,043
Men like you took away my
family, took my ability to love...

480
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,631
and almost took my life.

481
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,846
You will take nothing more.

482
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,642
You have been through so very much.

483
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,279
Vanessa would want you
to keep the painting.

484
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,700
Is that supposed to matter to me?

485
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,910
No.

486
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,834
But it matters to me.

487
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,353
What kind of psycho kills a priest?

488
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,141
This makes me sick.

489
00:37:58,318 --> 00:37:59,819
Come on out of there.

490
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,205
The FBI is going to freak when
they find out you let us go.

491
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,499
Yeah, well, they can
kiss my police-blue ass.

492
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,376
Seriously, are you gonna be okay?

493
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,226
I had to see it with my own eyes.

494
00:38:18,227 --> 00:38:20,840
Fisk really has turned the goddamn feds.

495
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,135
- Some of them.
- Can't believe no one saw it coming.

496
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,012
Well, actually, some of us did.

497
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,555
Yeah, that's true.

498
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,016
Nice takedown on Blake
Tower, by the way.

499
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,352
I posted the video on my profile page.

500
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,437
Brett, I'm flattered.

501
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,731
Even if he did crush
your ass at the end.

502
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,358
He didn't crush my ass.

503
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,127
You ran out of there
like a scared little...

504
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,071
- Nah, uh... it's my fault.
- Yeah, whatever.

505
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,657
You guys aren't alone
in this, you understand?

506
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,201
Fisk put a lot of my brothers
and sisters in the ground,

507
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,869
and none of us have forgotten that.

508
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,164
If you can find a way to
bring down that son of a bitch,

509
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,542
every cop in the city
is gonna have your back.

510
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,835
Thanks, Brett.

511
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:58,503
Take care of yourself.

512
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,969
Okay, so how do we play this?

513
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,888
Simple. We convince Matt to
take his head out of his ass.

514
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,563
So it looks like you
needed my help after all.

515
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:20,817
Yeah.

516
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,820
Yeah, I did, Foggy. You're right.

517
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,032
Do you have any idea how much
life has sucked for Karen and me

518
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,993
while you were off doin' your own thing?

519
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,828
No, but I'm sorry, Foggy.

520
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,831
Maybe I was wrong
to... to push you away.

521
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,263
Okay, it's insanely
hard to fight with you

522
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:39,085
if you keep agreeing with me.

523
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,962
Good, 'cause I don't
wanna fight with you.

524
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,633
Look, the way I've treated you,
the way I've treated you both...

525
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,386
You've deserved better.

526
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,472
Yes, we did.

527
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:52,891
Yes, you did.

528
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,981
Okay, so where do we go from here?

529
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,357
I don't want to leave you,

530
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,235
but I can't ask you to be
accomplices to what I have to do now.

531
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,822
What does that mean?

532
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,033
Um...

533
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,077
It means that, uh,
Matt's gonna kill Fisk.

534
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,081
That building falling on you
really did mess up your head.

535
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,125
We put him in prison,
Foggy. Look what happened.

536
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,210
It's not gonna be the same this time.

537
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,174
They're gonna throw him
in some supermax hole...

538
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,107
- Come on.
- ... where he can't compromise anybody.

539
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,843
- I know you're not that naive.
- It's called having faith in the system.

540
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,179
Something you used to have.

541
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,521
It's called facing the reality

542
00:40:32,522 --> 00:40:34,390
that some people are
so rich and powerful,

543
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,643
the system simply can't handle them,

544
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,770
that they actually are above the law.

545
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,773
That's the bullshit that people
like Fisk want you to believe.

546
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,025
Nobody's above the law.

547
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,995
The only thing powerful enough

548
00:40:45,996 --> 00:40:48,863
to take down scumbags
like him is the law.

549
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,241
He's twisted it into something
that actually protects him.

550
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,618
Federal law, maybe,

551
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,538
but we can build a state case
that even Blake Tower can't deny,

552
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,707
force him to take it to the grand jury.

553
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,791
Fisk has been five steps
ahead of us at every turn.

554
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,836
You really think he's
gonna allow that to happen?

555
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,173
Hey, you're right. You're
right. Maybe just hear him out.

556
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,759
Fine. I'm telling you,
it's not gonna work.

557
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,179
You want to give the law
another try, sure, I'm all ears.

558
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,515
Simple.

559
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,434
Step one, we work together.

560
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,997
Step two, we come up with
a plan. And step three,

561
00:41:22,998 --> 00:41:24,607
we execute that plan.

562
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,568
That's genius. Come up
with that by yourself?

563
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,821
So I'm still working out the details.

564
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,531
What about this?

565
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,658
What about we find
ourselves another witness?

566
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,244
Someone who will flip on Fisk.

567
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,080
But unlike Jasper Evans,
we keep 'em alive this time.

568
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,667
Someone who knows the details
of Fisk's criminal operation...

569
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,919
who has nothing to lose.

570
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,003
Okay?

571
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:47,964
No.

572
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,593
No, we find someone who
has everything to lose.

573
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,228
Copy that.

574
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,524
Karen Page has been found.

575
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,736
NYPD took her into custody.

576
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,031
The police? How?

577
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,491
It was Agent Nadeem's call.

578
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,039
Your jacket.

579
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,168
- Sir?
- Give me your jacket.

580
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,370
Pull over.

581
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,748
Get rid of the body.

582
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:05,750
Yes, sir.

583
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,987
Seema! Are you here?

584
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:40,785
What's the matter?

585
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,620
Dad?

586
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,705
It's okay. It's okay, Sami.

587
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,874
I saw the broken vase,
and I got worried.

588
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,544
Dad, sorry. I knocked it over.

589
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,671
Mom said she was gonna
clean it up later.

590
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,797
Are you mad?

591
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,757
No. No, of course not.

592
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,677
- We have to pack. Now.
- What's the...

593
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,637
Just for a few days, okay?

594
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,764
I have to work. I want
you to go away, okay?

595
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,892
Someplace fun. Like Disney World. Yeah?

596
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,562
But it has to be right this minute.

597
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,691
It's okay, Sami. It'll... It'll be fine.

598
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,944
- We can pack together. Come on.
- Go. Go, go, go, go.

599
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,784
- What's going on?
- I'll explain everything when you're safe.

600
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:24,871
- You're scaring me.
- Be scared later. Now, just hurry.

601
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,032
Stop.

602
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:03,618
This way.

603
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:12,627
Get back.

604
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,171
The sliders.

605
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,717
Take Sami into the bathroom
and lie down in the tub.

606
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,801
Now!

607
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,568
Obviously, I'm here to help you.

608
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,779
I sold you out to Fisk.

609
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,198
I know you didn't want to.

610
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,450
But I did.

611
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:11,245
So maybe you're here because you
wanna be the one that kills me

612
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,872
before Fisk gets around to it.

613
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,249
If we're gonna get your
family someplace safe,

614
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,667
you're gonna have to trust me.

615
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,586
I can't trust anybody.

616
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,713
Well, I trust you.

617
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,051
You saved Karen Page's life tonight.

618
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,101
So I owe you one.
