1
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,546
- FBI!
- FBI!

2
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,731
FBI! Get on the floor!

3
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:14,989
Get out of the bed!

4
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,203
FBI! Don't move!

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,292
- Freeze!
- Where are you going?

6
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,045
Off the bed!

7
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,255
Hands up! Show me your hands! Cuff him!

8
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,009
Hey. Give me your hands.

9
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,639
Take off these cuffs. I have
the right to an attorney.

10
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:43,309
You have no right here. Do you
understand? You have no right.

11
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,158
You got Mother Teresa.

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,035
You actually bagged that asshole.

13
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,828
Got his number one and number two also.

14
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,665
And two judges, district police cap...

15
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,166
A freakin' deputy mayor.

16
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,001
This is gonna be a
messy day for City Hall.

17
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:09,919
Yeah.

18
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,713
The Albanians had to be buying
those guys off with more than tail.

19
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,591
Burgos got their computers, so
we're gonna find their money.

20
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,678
Once we start tracking it,
who knows how far this goes?

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,346
Thank you, Wilson Fisk.

22
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,851
He's a gift that's gonna keep on giving.

23
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,854
Snitch!

24
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,616
No! No, don't!

25
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,244
No! No! No!

26
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,623
No!

27
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,377
All tier two COs,

28
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,130
we have a 10-49 in
progress in the weight room.

29
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,385
All tier two COs, we have
a fight in the weight room.

30
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,856
Guard! Guard! Guard!

31
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,569
You, up against the wall,
right now! Against the wall!

32

33
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,855
What did you do, Matthew?

34
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,279
Where did you go last night?

35
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,905
Hey. Don't pull that crap with me.

36
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,992
What happened?

37
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:28,451
Go away.

38
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:33,039
I put in way too much
work on you to quit now.

39
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,336
Up. Move your ass.

40
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:46,009
So you get beat by a guy who
wasn't even trying to hurt you,

41
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,766
and your brilliant next move is
to go out and pick another fight?

42
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,250
Here. Take these.

43
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,385
A word of advice, Mr. Daredevil...

44
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,199
give yourself time to heal, or
you're gonna get yourself killed.

45
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,286
You're probably right.

46
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,706
Is that what you wanted?

47
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,294
I have a special gift, too.

48
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,006
I'm impervious to bad attitude.

49
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,759
So you can throw your self-pitying
bullshit at me all day, Murdock,

50
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,886
and I'll still be standing right here.

51
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,973
Pissed off, maybe, but right here.

52
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,103
You're gonna talk to me.

53
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,022
Why did you become a nun?

54
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,442
I heard God's call.

55
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,198
So you feel like being a nun
is what you're meant to be?

56
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,491
Yes.

57
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,619
Very much.

58
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,455
What if you couldn't be one anymore?

59
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,915
If it were taken from you?

60
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,585
Your point being that if we
can't fulfill our calling,

61
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,796
we might be better off as worm food?

62
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,299
Answer the question.

63
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,885
I'll tell you what I wouldn't do.

64
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,221
I wouldn't lose faith.

65
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,097
I'd find some other purpose.

66
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,561
If you can be anything else, it
was never really your calling.

67
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,148
Just tell me, honestly.

68
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,067
If you could no longer be a nun,

69
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,402
wouldn't you grieve?

70
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,570
Of course I would.

71
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,906
Then please...

72
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:31,814
go away.

73
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,542
I understand what it's
like to feel lost, Matthew.

74
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,670
It happened to me, too, once.

75
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,425
A long time ago, when I
was still a novitiate...

76
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,053
I left the order for a while.

77
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,889
Why?

78
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,726
I was considering a very different life.

79
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,352
It was wonderful and terrifying.

80
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:05,107
I struggled to know which
life God wanted me to choose.

81
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,111
I prayed. I looked for signs.

82
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,280
In the end,

83
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,284
I just had to do my
best to figure it out.

84
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,330
Well, there you go.

85
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,750
That is the difference between us.

86
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,879
I no longer care what God wants.

87
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,798
Oh, right.

88
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,718
Almost forgot.

89
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,805
You've seen his true face now.

90
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,905
Those are some fancy moves, Matthew.

91
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,824
Sister Dora turned me in, didn't she?

92
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,785
This has to stop.

93
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,205
My Confirmation is in the spring.

94
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,081
I'm supposed to be
learning the catechism,

95
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,208
and Sister D can't even
defend original sin.

96
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,418
She is not a theologian.

97
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,296
You already know more about
it than she does, I'm sure.

98
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,006
So I can skip catechism?

99
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,009
No.

100
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,679
Come on.

101
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,973
Sit.

102
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,644
How many fights have
you been in this week?

103
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,063
- How many guys complained?
- None.

104
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,777
'Cause no one wants to admit they
got their butt kicked by a blind kid.

105
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,940
So you can't prove that I did anything.

106
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:35,781
I don't want to, and I don't need to.

107
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,411
It's not about proving
anything, Matthew.

108
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,495
Argumentation is a skill.

109
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,917
Being argumentative is a sign.

110
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,376
A sign like a prophecy?

111
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,463
A sign like you're angry, Matthew.

112
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:54,294
That's a perfectly understandable
reaction to your situation.

113
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,096
But it's not sustainable.

114
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,974
Or maybe it's a sign that Sister
Dora should stick to teaching math.

115
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,812
You're good...

116
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,650
at arguing and deflecting and
denying you're angry to other people.

117
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,989
But you're gonna have to
deal with your anger, Matthew.

118
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,619
Find a way to... harness it.

119
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,412
- Or it will destroy you.
- Well, if that's God's plan for me,

120
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,875
then I guess that's how it's
supposed to work out, isn't it?

121
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,047
You know, maybe you don't
understand original sin, after all.

122
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,759
God gave us free will, Matthew.

123
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,846
Adam and Eve were not
puppets, and neither are we.

124
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,180
We make our own choices.

125
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,227
That's one reason we pray,
for help making good ones.

126
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,813
You should try it sometime.

127
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,690
I do pray.

128
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,277
I pray all the time. I've
been praying for years.

129
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,281
God doesn't talk to me.

130
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,866
So that's what this is about?

131
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,080
You feel God is... neglecting you?

132
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:10,459
Matthew, the burning-bush
business doesn't happen very often,

133
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,336
even in the Bible.

134
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,049
He's usually more subtle than that.

135
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,305
You want to hear God, Matthew,
you have to listen more carefully.

136
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,851
Because he speaks in whispers.

137
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,532
Veggie sub.

138
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,201
- No meat.
- Thanks.

139
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,660
You don't want it.

140
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,286
Why not?

141
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,915
When you see the way Ramsey and
Arinori are kissing Hattley's ass,

142
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,836
you're gonna lose your appetite.

143
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,630
They're in her office right now.

144
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,507
Doing what?

145
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,633
Hattley gave you this raid.

146
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,552
But now that it worked,

147
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,514
well, somebody's got
to run Fisk full time.

148
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,303
Right? There he is.

149
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,366
Man of the hour.

150
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,868
You see the client list yet? Holy shit.

151
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,250
A moment, ma'am?

152
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:29,540
Sure, Ray.

153
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,673
Congratulations. Pristine execution.

154
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,676
Glad to hear it, boss. I got a big ask.

155
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,512
You want Fisk detail. I can't.

156
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,848
He's my kill. I get to eat first.

157
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,559
There's a goddamn buffet
in that conference room.

158
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,810
You can't fill up on that?

159
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,022
That's today. Now, what about tomorrow?

160
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,693
Look, we play Fisk right, there's
plenty for everyone for years.

161
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:01,862
He can give us every criminal
organization on the East Coast.

162
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,053
Hey, Pryor.

163
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:05,931
Find out how Burgos is
doing on the computers.

164
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:10,746
Dozens of agents had their shot at
Fisk. None of them got shit. But I did.

165
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,248
We got some big collars
out of this, Ray.

166
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm gonna make sure D.C. knows about it.

167
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,214
Why do I feel like
there's a "but" coming?

168
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,090
Shut the door.

169
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:31,141
I put you on Fisk detail,
your file is required reading.

170
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,143
You'll be naked. There
will be questions.

171
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,188
I've got answers.

172
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,980
I've got a boss, too.

173
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,735
And he's got a hard-on for
agents in financial holes.

174
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,021
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,321
No. No way.

176
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,322
Easy, Ray.

177
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,908
No. You tell D.C. that none
of this could have happened

178
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,786
without the unexpected connection
between me and Wilson Fisk.

179
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,037
Because that's the truth.

180
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,500
And then none of the other
shit in my file will matter.

181
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,877
Come on, Tammy.

182
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,964
How am I supposed to get out from under?

183
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,636
Okay, he's yours. But you
need to keep him talking, Ray.

184
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,720
I got this.

185
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:13,143
He better last years. Because
he goes dry, we're both burned.

186
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,028
- Hey.
- Hey.

187
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,156
"Rostam Kazemi." Mean anything to you?

188
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,576
- Uh, yeah, he's a real estate developer.
- Mmm-hmm.

189
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,494
Actually, his daughter, Neda,

190
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,289
is the mean one on the
Heiresses of Manhattan.

191
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,749
Not that I watch that kind
of crap or anything, but...

192
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,836
No, of course not.

193
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,290
Anyway, he and his daughter were

194
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:43,130
attacked outside a
restaurant last night.

195
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,478
He's in a coma at Riverbank Hospital,

196
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:47,384
think it might be a kidnapping attempt.

197
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,803
No, you know what? I think
you should give TJ that story.

198
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,346
He watches her show. He'd love it.

199
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,558
Well, that's... That's great.
That's nice. I'm giving it to you.

200
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,977
No, I'm in the middle of something here.

201
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,645
- Excuse me?
- It's not done yet,

202
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,098
but I'd like to stick
with it if that's okay.

203
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,202
What?

204
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,453
Uh, yeah, here.

205
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,762
What am I looking at?

206
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,289
Uh... They're reports
of respiratory illnesses

207
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,333
among residents of a
particular city block.

208
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,169
They've spiked. They're up,
like, 45% from last year.

209
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,881
- And which particular block would that be?
- 44th and 11th.

210
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,799
- Midland Circle adjacent.
- Karen.

211
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,218
Come on. I know we've done
a lot of pieces on this,

212
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,952
but there are still questions about
that night we don't have answers for.

213
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:36,458
- You think the answers are in here?
- I don't know. Maybe.

214
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,103
Just give me a couple
days. It's not done yet.

215
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,244
What is it about Midland Circle, Karen?

216
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:44,278
I mean, it's not just a story, is it?

217
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,696
Look. The work you've done on this,

218
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,782
reporting, the
writing... it's excellent.

219
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,118
It's great. It's some of the best
you've ever done. I'm proud of it.

220
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,829
I'm even maybe a little bit jealous.

221
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,539
But it's done.

222
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,291
So that's what we do now?

223
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,169
We just drop stories because some
socialite who photographs well

224
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,212
is down at the hospital?

225
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,548
That's a story, too.

226
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,510
And I thought that you might be
able to empathize with a young woman

227
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,847
who's been caught up in the
middle of a family crisis.

228
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,059
It's one thing to work a story, Karen.

229
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,313
It's another thing to
let a story work you.

230
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,401
- End of day tomorrow.
- Okay.

231
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,202
How the hell did you let this happen?

232
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,038
Don't try to pin this shit on us.

233
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,650
He's your snitch.

234
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,455
You okay?

235
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,805
They said it was superficial.

236
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,056
I find it quite profound.

237
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,641
Don't start.

238
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,061
We're not playing games here.

239
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,229
It's deadly serious for me.

240
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,066
What? Some guy with a shank?

241
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,943
It's not something I fear a great deal.

242
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,531
But we're not dealing
with one person here.

243
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,284
Word is out.

244
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,828
Everyone knows.

245
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,874
Guards and inmates, it seems they
know I'm cooperating with you.

246
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,960
Which you are going to
continue to do, Mr. Fisk.

247
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,380
This was not a one-off.

248
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,340
You want us to help Vanessa
clear herself of criminal charges,

249
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,218
you need to continue to
deliver actionable information.

250
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,638
Do you understand?

251
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,979
I have suddenly become a
target within these walls here.

252
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,398
Do you understand?

253
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,528
I'm helping you to help Vanessa.

254
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,912
I can't do either of
those things if I'm dead.

255
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,691
- Please, God...
- If you can help, please just...

256
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,692
Help me get this job.

257
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,072
I've got to keep paying them,
or they'll come for Mindy.

258
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:43,080
Please just call her home.

259
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,373
End her suffering, I beg you.

260
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,627
- Her moans, I...
- Give Derek justice.

261
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,840
Please, God, you know
he didn't do this thing.

262
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,425
That lawyer's no damn good,

263
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,095
but you can touch the jury, God.

264
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,973
Help them to see the truth.

265
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,856
Glad to see you up here, Matthew.

266
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,150
I used to listen to people's prayers.

267
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,986
In here and out on the street.

268
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:20,951
You know, people asking for
God's help or justice or...

269
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:22,968
vengeance sometimes.

270
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:24,788
See, it's always the same.

271
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:27,549
"Please, God."

272
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,714
I thought that God let
me hear the prayers...

273
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,216
so that I could answer.

274
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,719
So that's what I did. That's
what I was trying to do,

275
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,055
was trying to help people.

276
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,350
But I am not what I was.

277
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,480
Can't do what I used to do.

278
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,775
Give it time.

279
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,988
Whatever your new
reality is, you'll adjust.

280
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,367
When I heard all those
prayers, all those...

281
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,122
suffering people, I
thought it was God's voice.

282
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,169
But I was wrong.

283
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,172
All I ever heard was people in pain.

284
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,384
And all he ever gave any of us was...

285
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,263
silence.

286
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:31,063
So now you believe your calling
to do what you do was a mistake?

287
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,315
I was deluding myself.

288
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,903
Maybe that's a good
thing to realize, Matthew.

289
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,863
Maybe...

290
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,822
it's time for you to stop.

291
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,284
Oh...

292
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,995
No, Father, uh...

293
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,251
My delusion was thinking God
had anything to do with it.

294
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,130
I'm not as capable as I was, but...

295
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,968
I don't get to choose who I am.

296
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,096
I'm Daredevil.

297
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,642
Not even God can stop that now.

298
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,205
- Excuse me. I'm looking for a dry cleaner.
- Not doing pickups right now.

299
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,456
But we're on 14th Street.

300
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,210
Address is on the side there.

301
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,503
Here's where it gets awkward.

302
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,880
I'm actually looking
for a different place.

303
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,216
I got a whiff of their
delivery van last night.

304
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:48,016
It didn't smell like this. Not like
chemicals. It was more... herbal.

305
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,640
Kinda grassy, maybe?

306
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,850
Yeah, sure, like that.

307
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,395
I know the place.

308
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,794
How is he?

309
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,298
You're a journalist, aren't you?

310
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:27,179
- I've seen your picture in the Bulletin.
- Yeah, it's Karen Page.

311
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,722
Not to be a bitch, but I
don't want this in the papers.

312
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,308
No, you're not a bitch. I get it.

313
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,394
Then go.

314
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,734
I'm sorry. I'm really, really
sorry. But you don't understand.

315
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,403
You think because you don't want
this in the papers, it won't be?

316
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,321
If I don't say anything...

317
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,239
They'll make up things
that sound good to them.

318
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,119
And that's what will get written and what
people will talk about behind your back.

319
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,249
For the next year. The next five
years. For the rest of your life.

320
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,586
You talk like you know what this is.

321
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,756
Maybe I do.

322
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,135
You grow up with paparazzi on
your ass, following you to school?

323
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,429
- No.
- Yeah, I did.

324
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,305
You know what I learned?

325
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,724
I learned that anything
I say, anything at all,

326
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,146
you people will turn it into
whatever you want to, anyway.

327
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,605
I'm not like that.

328
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,192
Yeah. Sure.

329
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,778
Believe it or not, I really do
know what you're going through.

330
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,071
Your father almost got killed?

331
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,243
Nope. But people said
that I killed my brother.

332
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,749
God, I'm sorry.

333
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,221
You know, when Kevin died...

334
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,183
everyone wanted to know what happened.

335
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,062
And I wasn't like you, not
paparazzi or anything, but...

336
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,898
it's a small town.

337
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,693
Stuff kinda gets around on its own.

338
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,196
But since no one did know
the story, they made one up.

339
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,533
It was all bullshit.

340
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,742
If you thought about it for ten seconds,

341
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,976
it didn't even make sense, but...

342
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:18,858
why should that matter, right?

343
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,129
The problem was...

344
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,437
...once the story got
out there, it stuck.

345
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,888
It grew, and it got darker and, um...

346
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,973
meaner.

347
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,395
And the things they said
about my family and about me...

348
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,981
it, um...

349
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,568
sort of tore us apart.

350
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,782
Piece by piece and
lie by lie. And, um...

351
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,204
I didn't really know how
to deal with it back then.

352
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,459
Now I guess it's too late.

353
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,628
You're right.

354
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,466
The truth can't be worse, can it?

355
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,594
I don't know.

356
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,306
I don't know if the truth
is any better, but...

357
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,975
Well, at least it's real.

358
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,022
Okay.

359
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,529
Just take your time.

360
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,116
We were at dinner.

361
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,953
We were trying to patch
things up, you know?

362
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,831
We were walking to the car, and...

363
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,418
these two men grabbed my father.

364
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,631
They tried to put him into
this van to kidnap him.

365
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,219
We only got away because
the other guy attacked him.

366
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,971
What other guy? You
said there's another guy?

367
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,724
Yeah. He came out of nowhere.

368
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,270
He had this black mask over his face.

369
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,147
You're out of your mind.

370
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,025
Fisk's imprisonment would
continue at a private location

371
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,944
under the constant
supervision of the FBI.

372
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,320
That's house incarceration,

373
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,115
usually reserved for white-collar
criminals awaiting trial.

374
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,409
He was shanked by
another inmate hours ago.

375
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,184
Good. He's a cop killer.

376
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:23,579
That wasn't proven in court.

377
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,873
- Whose fault was that?
- We put on a good trial.

378
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,750
Five counts under RICO was a giant win.

379
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,335
Which you're about to give away.

380
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,254
You're the district attorney, Mr. Tower.

381
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,423
Think of the long game here.

382
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,718
We can't prosecute everything Fisk
is giving us at the federal level.

383
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,885
It's gonna trickle down.

384
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,430
You're trying to buy the NYPD

385
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:40,972
with collars and me with convictions.

386
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,100
When Fisk's intel leads to the
biggest crime drop in a decade...

387
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,354
- The guy is a piece of shit.
- You're right.

388
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:52,110
Wilson Fisk is a piece of shit.

389
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,738
After every time I'm in the room
with the guy, I want a shower.

390
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,326
But let's talk about the Albanians
for a minute, what they have done.

391
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,496
Four dead NYPD officers, 12 more
riding desks with disabilities.

392
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,915
One hundred and seven civilian murders.

393
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,251
And even after five task
forces over seven years,

394
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,797
to the tune of $11 million, we got zero.

395
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,009
Those are some shitty numbers.

396
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,511
But here's another one.

397
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,014
With Fisk's intel, we beheaded
the Albanian syndicate in one day.

398
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,850
One single day.

399
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,645
No loss of life, no injuries, no mayhem.

400
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,730
I mean, look at the take.

401
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,900
We got their documents and data,
and we're gonna get their money.

402
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,611
Best of all, we bagged corrupt officials

403
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:37,111
whose protection they were selling.

404
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,988
A lot of cases they've
been interfering with

405
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,700
may finally get somewhere.

406
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:46,206
Look, none of us like it. It makes
me want to throw up to admit it.

407
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,877
But New York is safer tonight
because of Wilson Fisk.

408
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,925
Now I need a shower.

409
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,223
If we keep him talking,
Fisk will give up others.

410
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,851
This deal will save lives.

411
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,944
Tell me you're not going for this.

412
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,584
Uncle Foggy!

413
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,294
Okay, easy, easy. Left
pocket. Left pocket.

414
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,338
You're gonna save them
for after dinner, right?

415
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,801
Don't tell your mother! Or my mother.

416
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,434
Hey! Foggy's here!

417
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,018
- Hey!
- Foggy!

418
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,270
Hey there, Counselor.

419
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,313
"How are your briefs holding up?"

420
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,400
What's up?

421
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,068
Christ, that joke gets old.

422
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,445
Gets old?

423
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,616
Listen, Franklin, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

424
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,409
Hi.

425
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,206
- Try a little. I put cinnamon in it.
- Mmm! Delicious. So good.

426
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,003
Is he worse?

427
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:21,215
Your father's arthritis gets
a little worse every day.

428
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,969
He's having trouble holding onto
things, especially when he's tired.

429
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,638
I see him with the saws and slicers.

430
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,530
Ma, I'm sorry. Isn't there
anything they can do for it?

431
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:34,395
There's no cure for
getting old, Franklin.

432
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:38,867
Your father needs to be on a beach,
not slinging meat in Hell's Kitchen.

433
00:29:39,436 --> 00:29:42,322
Forty years is enough already.

434
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,573
I know. You got yourself a life.

435
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,908
A good life.

436
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,204
But maybe it's time you came home.

437
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,539
I'm right here when you need me.

438
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,877
Your brother loves this place,
but Theo can't do it alone.

439
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,960
Come help.

440
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,546
Put those brains to
work for your family,

441
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:04,258
not every uptown shithead
that comes into your office.

442
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,262
They're not all shitheads, Ma.

443
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,307
I'm not telling you what to do.

444
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:14,060
You're a grown man. Just think
about it. That's all I'm sayin'.

445
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,436
Okay.

446
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,022
I will. I promise.

447
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,025
Good.

448
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,027
I love you, kid.

449
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,947
Hey! I can smell the candy
from here, Ruthie! Come here.

450
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,617
Where'd you get that?Â Where'd
you get that? Where'd you get that?

451
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,579
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey!

452
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,668
- Do you want a glass?
- Damn sure didn't come to chat.

453
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,589
The suits I understand, Foggy, but...

454
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:46,117
why you drink this
expensive crap is beyond me.

455
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,225
You know how proud of you I am, Foggy?

456
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,227
You're a big deal.

457
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,312
- Which is what you always wanted.
- Did I?

458
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,773
Ever since you could talk,

459
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,528
you went around telling people
that you owned the store.

460
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,071
They'd play along with it, too.

461
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,825
- Remember?
- Yeah.

462
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:13,420
I got it, Pops. I got it.

463
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,332
Yeah.

464
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,960
Sláinte.

465
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,442
Your lawyer almost
screwed up the whole deal.

466
00:31:30,445 --> 00:31:33,474
Those terms guarantee my safety.

467
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,810
Beyoncé has fewer demands.

468
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,026
This way, convict.

469
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,937
You want service, you gotta get in line.

470
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,648
Oh... Oh.

471
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:25,177
Come on, come on. You got a
ticket, you just picking up?

472
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,388
- Me?
- Yeah.

473
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:29,277
Oh, no, I just ran in 'cause
your clothes smell so good.

474
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,656
See, I got this real
sensitive nose. I thought...

475
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,575
Yeah, we use a totally
organic process, latest stuff.

476
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,412
Oh, cool. You got a flyer?

477
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,247
Not in Braille.

478
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,788
I... I got seeing friends.

479
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,086
Here, have a coupon.

480
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,547
Thanks, I appreciate it.

481
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,719
- Glad I found you. Really makes my day.
- All right.

482
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,241
God damn it. We must have blown a fuse.

483
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:41,585
Hello! You!

484
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,948
Yeah, I'd like to report an assault.

485
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,868
I didn't see what happened, but
there are a lot of guns here.

486
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,163
Maybe some kind of robbery.

487
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,340
I don't think I ever said it,

488
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:22,021
but thank you, Theo,
for taking over the shop.

489
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,555
They wanted it to be you.

490
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,098
Yeah.

491
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,644
For a long time, I kinda
wanted it to be you, too.

492
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,647
- You never said anything.
- What was there to say?

493
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,274
You got a head for other things.

494
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,821
You were always getting the
prizes and scholarships and shit.

495
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,907
Anyway, you can't make a
sandwich to save your ass.

496
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,915
Theo, if we need to figure out...

497
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,043
Knock it off.

498
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:54,503
Go do what you're good at.

499
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,839
You're livin' the dream.

500
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,759
Am I?

501
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,886
You're shittin' me.

502
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,516
I had this idea of how
things were gonna go.

503
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,313
Matt and I talked a
lot about what we'd do.

504
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,319
Open our own firm.
Help people. Get rich.

505
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,906
I was the get rich part.
He was the help people part.

506
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,328
When he was around, I knew who I was.

507
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,624
Now...

508
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:31,046
Matt was a good guy.

509
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,695
Sláinte.

510
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,303
You can always come back here.

511
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,933
Yeah, great. Thanks.

512
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,436
Hi.

513
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,521
Sorry, I...

514
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,647
Perfect timing.

515
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,941
Now everyone can stop worrying
about my career choices

516
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,652
and start worrying about me
cheating on Marci. Much better.

517
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,115
- Can I to talk to you?
- What's wrong?

518
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,284
I think Matt's alive.

519
00:38:10,295 --> 00:38:11,879
So the guy in the mask,

520
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:13,997
he wasn't in a, you know, devil suit?

521
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,208
No, but he was wearing a black mask.

522
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,794
- So it could be anybody.
- It could also not be anybody.

523
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,839
Hell's Kitchen is ground zero
for vigilantes these days.

524
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,302
Believe me, I want it to
be Matt, too. But he's...

525
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,135
- gone.
- No, no.

526
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,762
- We need to get past that.
- There is no proof of that.

527
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,932
- And until there is...
- You know how I know he's gone?

528
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,352
Because if it was Matt,

529
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,823
if he was really still alive,
he would've reached out to us.

530
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,486
You know how I know that you
don't really believe that?

531
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,573
You keep saying "gone"
instead of "dead."

532
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,032
Now, don't you want to take a minute

533
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,454
and just be absolutely sure that's not
your best friend out there somewhere?

534
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,913
I wish it was my best friend.

535
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,251
But it's not. He's dead.

536
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,174
Karen, come on. Stay.

537
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,724
What? You.

538
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,821
Your father...

539
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,364
he's in a coma.

540
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,533
He's alive.

541
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,744
Why did you help us?

542
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,374
The men who did this are in
police custody for another crime.

543
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,417
You head down to the 15th Precinct
right now, you can identify them.

544
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,543
You caught them?

545
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,605
You should go.

546
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:43,964
Thank God for you.

547
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,342
He didn't help you.

548
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,094
I did.

549
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,188
You will be under the strict
supervision of my team.

550
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,460
You will not remove your ankle monitor.

551
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:06,151
You will not pass beyond
the boundaries shown to you.

552
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,987
You will continue to have a
strictly regulated schedule.

553
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,448
That means eating, sleeping,
shitting, whenever I say.

554
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,160
Do you understand, Mr. Fisk?

555
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,123
I've spent much of my life alone.

556
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:22,795
And for many years, I pretended that
this was the source of my strength.

557
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,757
I told myself I had free will.

558
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,556
And in that time, I
achieved a great deal.

559
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,686
But I was not fulfilled.

560
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:44,189
I was longing for a
connection that I could imagine

561
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,068
but I could not achieve.

562
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,447
Searching and not finding.

563
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,786
Until Vanessa.

564
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,498
Until I discovered love.

565
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,585
I thought I would explode
with the sense of power

566
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,381
and freedom that she brought me.

567
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,927
That the world lay at my feet.

568
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,105
But then that passed when I discovered

569
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:21,230
the great lie at the heart of love.

570
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:27,950
That what I took for true
freedom was precisely the reverse.

571
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,322
You can build a prison
of stone and steel,

572
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,326
but you merely present the
prisoner with a challenge.

573
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,374
Any truly determined
man will find a way out.

574
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:46,010
But love...

575
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,050
Love is the perfect prison.

576
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,845
Inescapable.

577
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,932
So you see, Agent Nadeem...

578
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,682
I am always in prison,

579
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,979
wherever I go.

580
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,981
And if these things
help me protect Vanessa,

581
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,693
then they are nothing to me.

582
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,698
I will do whatever I must.

583
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,751
Go left! Left!

584
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,910
Nadeem!

585
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,997
Nadeem!

586
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,998
Prepare to fire!

587
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:51,667
Grenade!

588
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,449
Stay in the car!

589
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:46,532
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! We surrender!

590
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,497
Convict.

591
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,501
Don't move.

592
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,636
Put him in bay 3.

593
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,845
Excuse me, sir.

594
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:49,848
Sorry.

595
00:47:15,204 --> 00:47:17,913
- Multiple GSWs.
- First one up...

596
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:20,627
Goddamn Albanians killed
everyone except Fisk.

597
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,838
Somebody said he's en
route to the safe house.

598
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,422
It's a damn shitshow.

599
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,177
The FBI just let Wilson
Fisk out of prison.

600
