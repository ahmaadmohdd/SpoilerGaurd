1
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:16,142
Record temperatures in the New York area

2
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:21,272
as 100-degree weather hits its fifth
consecutive day with no end in sight.

3
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,858
I'll tell you who I want!

4
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,905
I told you I'll call you later.

5
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,408
Yeah, you'll get what you want.

6
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:36,913
...lowlife pulls a piece on me.

7
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,081
It never worked!

8
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:40,333
What's wrong with you?
I tell you not to touch--

9
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,548
You want to move your car? Huh?

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,523
Get out of the way!

11
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,612
Oh, my God!

12
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:10,113
Move, move!

13
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,204
They opened fire.

14
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:21,415
Move the hell out of the way!

15
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,464
Drop the gun!

16
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,592
Drop the gun and get on the ground--

17
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,872
Out of my way!

18
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,624
Move!

19
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:25,563
Move, move, move!

20
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,023
You get out of the car!

21
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,192
- Get out of the way, now!
- Get out of the car, now!

22
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,611
Call 911.

23
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:40,078
- And then he went to--
- You! You!

24
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,748
Stay calm!

25
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,416
Call the cops.

26
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,626
Let me go!
Please put me down.

27
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:56,302
- Help! Anybody, please help!
- Shut up! Shut up!

28
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,646
Stand back, everybody.
Okay, please, please.

29
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,575
You ever wake up in the morning...

30
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,870
from the second you get out of bed, it's like...

31
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,704
every molecule in your body hurts?

32
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,165
- No, never.
- I'm in agony, dude.

33
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,375
What, did you go back to the gym?

34
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,836
Hell, no. Do I look capable
of making healthy life choices?

35
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,089
I went out, Matthew.
Went out dancing.

36
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,674
- I'm choosing not to believe that.
- And yet, it's true.

37
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,551
- Mind if I ask you a personal question?
- Go ahead.

38
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,929
- Are you insane?
- Yes.

39
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:48,141
- Tell me it was the barista.
- Hey, Foggy. Looking good!

40
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,351
Her name is Bethany

41
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,978
- and she is very limber.
- Oh!

42
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,104
You're my hero.

43
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,608
- Watch it, asshole.
- So, uh, when's the next date?

44
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,777
- Well, therein lies the true pain.
- No!

45
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,238
Yes. One and done.

46
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,241
End of the night, she hugged me
like a cousin and said, "I'll call you."

47
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,368
Oh, that's brutal.

48
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,288
- You know what my problem is?
- Well, it ain't the moves.

49
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,915
You know I got the moves.

50
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,167
That's the tragedy of you being blind,
you've never seen me dance.

51
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,252
Yeah, but I can cite the legends
I heard in law school.

52
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,015
So come on, what is it?
What's the problem?

53
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:21,465
No wingman.
You never come out with me anymore.

54
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,135
Could you imagine
Nelson and Murdock on the dance floor?

55
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,763
I can't deny that does sound epic.

56
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,140
- Then come out with me, Matt.
- All right.

57
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,142
Come on, just one time, me and you.

58
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,103
What is it?

59
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,230
You're bleeding.

60
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,943
- Huh. Where?
- Base of the skull.

61
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,862
Did you get it?

62
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:47,241
No one's gonna notice, if that's what you mean.

63
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,409
Thank you.

64
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,287
- I hate this.
- We don't need to talk about it.

65
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,039
Good thinking.

66
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,167
You know, Karen's been asking questions.
The cuts, the scrapes, the bruises.

67
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,627
- What do you tell her?
- You have a drinking problem.

68
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,713
That's horrible.

69
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,215
Well, it's more plausible than

70
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,842
you put on a devil suit
and beat the shit out of strangers.

71
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,805
You know, this whole thing
isn't just your problem anymore.

72
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,683
And I'm past worrying about the broken bones,

73
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,936
and finding you beaten into a coma.

74
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:20,066
- What about us?
- Nelson and Murdock?

75
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,269
You ever stop to think
what happens if you get caught?

76
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,478
At best, you'll be disbarred.

77
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,989
Then you'll continue to do
the good work we started together.

78
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,615
Do you even hear yourself?

79
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,160
You're my partner.
I don't wanna continue alone.

80
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,411
Foggy...

81
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,292
last week, a client came to our office, Zuly Almeida.

82
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,711
Claimed her life was in danger.
We had no legal recourse to offer.

83
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,421
I remember.

84
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,798
You recommended an excellent shelter
for battered women.

85
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,135
- And she went.
- Yeah, she tried.

86
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:51,305
That night, her husband found out
she wanted to leave him,

87
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,515
and he followed her to the bus stop

88
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,143
with a gut full of beer
and a butcher knife in his hand.

89
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,264
- You never told me that.
- Well, I'm telling you now.

90
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,065
Mr. Almeida walked out of his apartment

91
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:05,611
with the intention to hack Mrs. Almeida
into many bloody pieces...

92
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,696
starting by taking off her head.

93
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,533
Guess what?

94
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:11,784
Never happened.

95
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,997
Instead, he woke up in a hospital
with two broken arms

96
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,042
and a restraining order safety-pinned to his chest.

97
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,377
Jesus, Matt.

98
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,837
If I take a night off, people get hurt.

99
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,174
I don't wanna lose you.

100
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:29,010
- You won't.
- Promise me.

101
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:32,596
You want me to cross my heart?

102
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,308
Do not make fun of me.

103
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,851
I swear.

104
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,730
Come on. Let's get to work.

105
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,732
Yeah, I gotta get out of this heat.

106
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,492
Idiots.

107
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,164
Good morning, guys.
You take the scenic route this morning?

108
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,499
- Morning to you, too.
- Morning, Karen.

109
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,043
- What have we got?
- All right.

110
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:06,214
Well, uh, Mr. Marino's dog was viciously beaten

111
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:09,217
by his neighbor after the dog, um...

112
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,428
defiled the neighbor's statue of Saint Francis.

113
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,846
- "Defiled"?
- Um...

114
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,140
humped repeatedly until completion.

115
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:20,269
- That's a dog I want to defend.
- Oh, he's... he's all yours, cowboy.

116
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:23,606
And, uh, Mr. Maxwell here
was attacked in a bar fight last night.

117
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:24,732
He started it.

118
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:28,026
Oh, I... I called Metro-General
and the other guy will recover,

119
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:29,237
but if you are looking at trial,

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,073
you probably wanna wait until his jaw is unwired.

121
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,949
Your girl's a badass.

122
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,286
You've no idea.

123
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,873
Um, and, uh, Miss Jacinto's working papers

124
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,126
have been denied for the third time.

125
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,586
Her father's gone and she says that factory work is

126
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,171
the only way she can support her family.

127
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,006
- Well, tell her not to worry.
- Yeah.

128
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,799
I've already pulled her applications from the DOE.

129
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,094
Good, because we're gonna find her something better.

130
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,257
And that's just the appointments for the first hour.

131
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,223
You wanna talk about our 10:00 a.m.'s?

132
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,309
Uh, what's that?

133
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,811
Oh, uh, the bananas are from Mr. Tate.

134
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,523
Payment for that fender bender thing.
And for you...

135
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,608
Strawberry rhubarb.

136
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,318
You will be mine.

137
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,862
Uh, so, um...

138
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,242
I installed this free trial
of accounting software on my computer.

139
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,203
And the good news is that
I can re-up it every 30 days

140
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:22,039
with a fake email address. But, um...

141
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:27,085
the bad news is that... we're broke.

142
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,007
As in, literally no money.
And our income can't cover our bills.

143
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,718
We'll manage.

144
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,264
I don't know how, but I know we will.

145
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,310
All right.

146
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,645
Well, in the meantime, I guess we have, um...

147
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:48,607
lots of pastries and... and fruit.

148
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,108
Yeah, and fans.

149
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:51,819
- Portable, electric fans.
- Yes.

150
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,489
And, uh... and each other.

151
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,909
Miss Jacinto, will you come in, please?

152
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:04,122
Let's see if we can find you a better way
to live in Hell's Kitchen.

153
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:05,624
Please, sit down.

154
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,462
Apologies, Mr. Nesbitt.
Blood's still up.

155
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,423
Best you mind him, Thomas.

156
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:56,884
You miserable mutt!

157
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,219
Where was all that fight 10 minutes ago?

158
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,822
Place smells like dog shit!

159
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,616
There's a pot calling the kettle.

160
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,705
Someone get this poor man a drink.

161
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:33,253
Grotto, you mangy shite.
How's the view up Nesbitt's ass?

162
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,305
Gentlemen, if you'll permit me...

163
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,057
a word before we begin.

164
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,520
This is a night for celebration.

165
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,233
A night to discuss the future of our family...

166
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,655
the gratitude we feel for the support of his father.

167
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,659
But perhaps as important...

168
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:09,247
it is also... a moment for sober reflection.

169
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:11,875
Sober, my ass.

170
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,844
Two hundred years ago, our people
were little more than dirt farmers,

171
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,137
struggling just to survive.

172
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:27,683
They had nothing but their hopes and their fists,

173
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,519
and they brought both of them along
when they came to America,

174
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,229
many to this very city.

175
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,897
Think you've had enough, George.

176
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:40,028
Now some of you are young...

177
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,990
so there's no reason you'd remember,

178
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:49,455
but there was a time
when the Irish owned Hell's Kitchen.

179
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:53,917
Wasn't a mother's son could
make a move without giving us our due,

180
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:59,047
and any sorry shite dull enough
to cross us paid a heavy price.

181
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,385
We had the cops, judges, councilmen.

182
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:05,679
We had the whole bloody city at our beck and call.

183
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,892
But we got complacent.

184
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,936
Lost our edge.

185
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,731
Just enough for a piece of garbage like Wilson Fisk

186
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,191
to steal what was rightfully ours.

187
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,959
That's right.

188
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,420
Some of us feared Fisk.

189
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,464
Some, in fact, ran.

190
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,425
A few...

191
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,719
maybe even deigned to work for him.

192
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,806
Siding against their own kind.

193
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,230
But now the Devil's taken him down,

194
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:01,026
and that, gentlemen, has provided us
with a singular opportunity.

195
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,611
The Russians are dead.

196
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,739
The Chinese, they turned tail and ran,

197
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:09,117
leaving the drug trade ripe for the taking.

198
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,953
The yakuza have gone silent.

199
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,581
- Piss on 'em!
- Piss on 'em all!

200
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,374
- Piss on 'em all.
- 'Cause this is our time!

201
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,420
Anyone crosses us,

202
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,547
we'll paint the streets red with their blood.

203
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,049
And when they're gone, we'll make your father proud,

204
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:28,554
and purge ourselves of the filthy traitors
who betrayed their own kind

205
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,599
and make Hell's Kitchen ours again!

206
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,308
See, I don't know, that definitely
sounded like cheating to me, Miss Page.

207
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,435
Foggy, you sure we're not being hustled here?

208
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,730
As sure as Josie's AC is busted.

209
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,314
What AC?

210
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,858
At least she brought water.

211
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,341
- Oh!
- No, you don't wanna do that.

212
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,987
- You can't drink the water here.
- Josie's pipes have issues.

213
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,697
Rust, mold.

214
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,449
I think I can actually see the bacteria

215
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,852
- floating in there.
- Oh, ew, ew.

216
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,204
See, that... that's why we, uh,
keep our cocktails neat.

217
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,956
Pretend you're abroad,

218
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,083
on vacation someplace exotic, but no mojitos.

219
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,209
Josie just throws mint in the beer.

220
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,586
- Right.
- Take over, buddy.

221
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,670
I gotta hit the head.

222
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:09,172
And don't let her out of your four working senses.

223
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,216
- She's as quick as she is beautiful.
- Right.

224
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,593
She reminds me of myself.

225
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:20,558
Ah, this place brings out something...
special in Foggy

226
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:23,020
Are you sure it's not the alcohol?

227
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,773
No, it's the company.

228
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,399
He likes it when it's the three of us.

229
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,655
If it were up to him, we'd be doing this
the rest of our lives.

230
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,536
God damn it.

231
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,997
- What happened?
- There goes my shutout.

232
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,541
Um, you're going for a shutout against a blind man?

233
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,419
How do you sleep at night, Miss Page?

234
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,797
You don't get any sympathy from me, Murdock.

235
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,215
I'm still not sure who's hustling who here.

236
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,426
All right.

237
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:55,552
Here's your cue.

238
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:59,014
All right, you're lined up with the cue ball.

239
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:02,059
Six is at your two, pocket straightaway.

240
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,852
Six and pocket two.

241
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,479
Mmm-hmm.

242
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,148
Fire away.

243
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,947
- How'd I do?
- Well, you've got potential.

244
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,032
- All right.
- Here, go again.

245
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,254
Six ball.

246
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,798
Straight ahead. Just...

247
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,760
real soft.

248
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,061
Come on, you've done this before.
Just go for it.

249
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,357
No!

250
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,984
That good, huh?

251
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,278
- Sunk the eight ball.
- Well, something went in.

252
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,615
I'll tell you what.
You boys re-rack, I will, uh,

253
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,200
buy rounds for the rematch.

254
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,666
- I leave you two alone for one minute...
- She wanted to teach me.

255
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,253
What?

256
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,509
Show off.

257
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,985
Hey, Foggy.

258
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,906
The guy at the bar looking this way, you know him?

259
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,949
No.
Why? What's his deal?

260
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,328
Adrenaline's high.

261
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,749
His heart rate's out of control.

262
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,126
Well, he is sitting next to Karen.

263
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,420
There's something in his coat.

264
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,339
Coat? Hot room.

265
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,967
I don't need fancy senses
to know he's probably packing.

266
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,054
What? Matt, don't make a thing.
Half the people in here are carrying guns.

267
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,973
Yeah, but none of them
have their finger tapping the trigger.

268
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,475
Thanks, Jos.

269
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,612
You, uh, new here, friend?

270
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,491
- No, actually.
- Hey, it's all right.

271
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,036
Look, I'm just... I'm just
letting you know, this is a good place

272
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,620
with good people.

273
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,415
A lot of places a guy like you could drink.

274
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:32,918
Just saying.

275
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,963
It's not what you think.
I got business here.

276
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,547
With Nelson and Murdock.

277
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,676
You must be the blind one.

278
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:48,683
Fifteen men, tough Irish.
Armed.

279
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,186
All of them blown away.

280
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,687
It was a massacre.

281
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:58,026
We weren't hit by any rival family there.
I'm telling you, we were...

282
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,319
hit by an army.

283
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,323
- That's quite the story.
- It's a fact.

284
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,166
And believe me, you can go see for yourself.

285
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,327
Burren Club, 47th and 10th.
Can't miss it.

286
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,248
It's the... part of New York
that looks like a goddamn war zone.

287
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,210
What's your involvement in their organization?

288
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,256
- Who's she?
- Answer the question.

289
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,135
Brannigan.

290
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:25,678
I've run with them for a long time.
I don't deny it.

291
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,224
Pick-ups, drop-offs, sometimes doing things I...

292
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,059
shouldn't be.

293
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:33,686
No question, I'm... I'm no choir boy.

294
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,439
I'm tellin' ya, I just skirt the surface.

295
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,027
Unlike the men I work for,

296
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,237
and the guys that did this.

297
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,282
I'm telling ya, I had nothing
to do with that massacre.

298
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,463
Assuming you're correct and the Irish were hit

299
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,625
by a powerful crime syndicate tonight...

300
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,046
if you're the only one who survived,

301
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,839
your good fortune's gonna rub
some dangerous people the wrong way.

302
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,133
No shit!

303
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,053
I got a pack of killers gunning for my men.

304
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,013
My people think I'm a traitor or a rat.

305
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,974
So, what can Nelson and Murdock do for you, Mister...

306
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,144
- I'm Grotto.
- Grotto what?

307
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,521
Just Grotto.

308
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,691
Witness protection.

309
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,234
You guys need to get me the hell out of here

310
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:24,029
before I end up in the only place hotter than this...

311
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,406
- permanent.
- We're a private law firm.

312
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,783
Yeah, a trustworthy one.

313
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,578
Quite a reputation after you took out Wilson Fisk.

314
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,039
The DA's office is the only place
that can make a deal.

315
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,282
Yeah, I'm not walking to the DA
without representation.

316
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,667
I know a lot.
I seen a lot.

317
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:43,048
I'll give the cops anything
to get me out of Hell's Kitchen.

318
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,925
Well, we have a reputation for representing

319
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,345
the good people of Hell's Kitchen,

320
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,597
not for negotiating on behalf of career criminals.

321
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,932
What if a criminal wants to... change his career?

322
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,019
A second chance, that's all I want.

323
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,645
I know I'm only coming here with my word.

324
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,357
I got nobody to vouch for me, but I can...

325
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,276
barely cover your fee.
But word is...

326
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,487
that Nelson and Murdock put their faith in people.

327
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,239
And I need a little of that right now.

328
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,159
Please.

329
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,375
Lie low.
We'll look into it.

330
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,043
You have somewhere you can stay?

331
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:22,920
Jesus.

332
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,507
Hey.

333
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,180
Guys?

334
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,931
Guys, he's bleeding.

335
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,725
Aw, sheesh.

336
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,395
Every time I think we've seen it all...

337
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:44,942
Hell's Kitchen manages to sneak up
and kick me right in the balls.

338
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,327
It's gonna take weeks to process this shit.

339
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,580
And where's this asshole's hand?

340
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,089
- Guys, we gotta post stuff now.
- We got two.

341
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:07,465
- You got two?
- Yeah.

342
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,592
- All right, you might need additional--
- Right, right, right.

343
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,428
We also got forensics on the scene.

344
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,762
Hey, I just need to know if my brother's in there.

345
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,392
Step back, please. I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't answer that right now.

346
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,561
Hey, Brett!
Over here, Matt.

347
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,234
I would say it's good to see you,
but under the circumstances...

348
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:29,571
- Would you please step aside, sir?
- We got a couple of questions, Brett.

349
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:33,200
If you're here to chase ambulances,
you might notice there are none.

350
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,883
- Any leads on what happened?
- Oh, you wanna know what went down?

351
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,163
Read about it in the papers like everybody else.

352
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:40,498
We're not everybody else, my man.

353
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,336
Did you just say "my man"?

354
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,546
Uh, label this one six.

355
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:51,093
All right, now.
Let's get body bags over here.

356
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,260
Look at this, will you?

357
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,553
Now, what kind of bullet can punch through

358
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:57,140
polyethylene fiber vest thicker than my dick...

359
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:01,018
then punch straight through
the same shit on his back?

360
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,771
All right, we get it.

361
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:05,732
You can't talk about an active crime scene.

362
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,067
However...

363
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,236
what if...

364
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,946
hypothetically speaking...

365
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,741
we may have recently acquired
a new client that could help...

366
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:18,870
shed some light on this investigation?

367
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,206
- How recent?
- Farm fresh.

368
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,876
- Was he here?
- Client privilege.

369
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,005
Well, uh, Mr. Nelson, if that was true...

370
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,173
Hypothetically speaking.

371
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:33,385
...I'd tell you that withholding
your client from the NYPD

372
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,803
would be obstructing governmental administration,

373
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:38,806
and I'd probably just arrest your ass myself.

374
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,974
In theory.

375
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,269
I guess we really can't help each other after all.

376
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,604
It's over 100 degrees out here tonight, Sergeant.

377
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,523
Why would an Irish mobster

378
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,359
wear body armor to a private meeting
inside his own club?

379
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:51,778
Hey!

380
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,656
Tell 'em keep it down in there
or somebody's getting written up.

381
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,206
I help you...

382
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,124
you help me?

383
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,335
That's all we want.

384
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,630
There's a total clampdown
on any of this getting out to the press.

385
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,549
- I'd like to keep it that way.
- Brett...

386
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,218
you can trust us.

387
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,428
We're lawyers.

388
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,932
Come with me over here.

389
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:22,934
Come on.

390
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,403
DA's going bat shit trying to figure it out.

391
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:38,074
This isn't the first hit that matches this MO.

392
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,328
Call it massive gang-on-gang overkill.

393
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,771
Downtown office thinks we got
new players in Hell's Kitchen,

394
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,210
and whoever they are, we're talking some
kind of paramilitary-type organization

395
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:51,546
with the training, knowledge and hardware
to take out half the city.

396
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,881
- What do they want?
- That's what's driving the DA nuts.

397
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,259
We don't know who they are.

398
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:57,677
We just know who they're not.

399
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,762
I'd say they're definitely not fond of the Irish.

400
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,681
You think?

401
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,976
Where exactly am I gonna put this asshole?

402
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,478
The morgue's completely full.

403
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:09,272
This is worse than what happened to the Dogs of Hell.

404
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,650
Now, we got history,

405
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,403
so I'll tell you as a friend,
you stay out of this shit.

406
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,865
If you got a witness, the smart move
is to turn him over and walk away.

407
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,451
Hell's Kitchen is about to explode.

408
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,249
You hear that?
He called me friend.

409
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,837
What'd you pick up?
Your hearing's better than mine.

410
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,507
Whatever happened here happened
to the Dogs of Hell last week.

411
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,967
- The biker gang?
- Yeah.

412
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,177
- What are we stepping into?
- I don't know.

413
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:43,806
I think I can rattle some cages,
see who talks but, uh...

414
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,476
Did you even listen to Brett?

415
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,562
We're talking about a squad
of trained killers loose on the streets.

416
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,440
Not the kind of guys you challenge
to a fist fight in your underwear.

417
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:55,192
Hey!
It's not underwear, Foggy.

418
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,194
Underwear is comfortable.

419
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,863
You're a lot of things.

420
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,782
Bulletproof is not one of them.

421
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:03,618
- I'll see you in the morning.
- You're an asshole.

422
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,912
But if I can't stop you, least I can do is help.

423
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,374
I have a guy I can talk to.
Maybe come back with a few puzzle pieces.

424
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,459
Cool. Just be careful.

425
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,295
You don't get to say that!

426
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,767
Okay, okay, okay.
You've got multiple lacerations, Steve.

427
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,143
All right? The doctor said--

428
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,479
- No! No doctor.
- The cut is deep, all right?

429
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,939
Into the muscle, but there's no vessel damage.

430
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,774
Nothing that a few weeks
of physical therapy can't cure.

431
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,067
You need to stay here.

432
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,694
- That ain't happening.
- No, I'm here to help you.

433
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,988
By hog-tying me to a hospital
with a target on my ass?

434
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,324
You wanna wait for a bullet through the window

435
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:44,409
- or pull the trigger myself?
- You need to listen to me, Steve.

436
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,744
- No, you listen to me, you daft woman!
- You can trust me!

437
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,581
- Who, in Christ's name, is Steve?
- You are.

438
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,792
Your name is Steve Schaffer,
and I am your wife, Isabelle.

439
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,002
You got into a bar fight defending my honor.

440
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,796
And other than the beer that was wasted

441
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,465
when that bottle sliced through your flesh,

442
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:01,468
I have got no regrets, because I have
loved you since I was 16,

443
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:04,220
hot Irish temper and all.

444
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:12,604
Nurse actually cried
when I told her that part, by the way.

445
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,858
It's a nice story, doll.

446
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,944
You gotta run home now.

447
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,822
You ain't got the balls for what's coming.

448
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,703
Slide into bed, sweetheart, and settle in.

449
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:31,956
Because I am the best chance
you've got in the world right now.

450
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,011
You got your break-action singles,

451
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,972
your side-by-side, your over-unders,

452
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,433
and the classic pump-action.

453
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:54,604
All guaranteed to supersede
every other on the market.

454
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,105
None of these is semis.

455
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,275
Aw, what do you need semis for,
couple bad-asses like you?

456
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,028
Whatever this army is,
they're planting men by the dozen, Turk.

457
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,613
No semis, no deal.

458
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,698
Man, I seen you shoot.

459
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,867
No semi's gonna magically make you have good aim.

460
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,995
Saw these off, spread your blast,

461
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,706
and thank me later, 'cause you ain't no deadeye.

462
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,041
What'd you just say?

463
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:19,879
Oh, shit.

464
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,529
Nice duds.

465
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,952
The Irish had a whole squad massacred tonight.

466
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:54,121
That's a damn shame,
'cause I'm fresh out of sympathy cards.

467
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,124
There's talk about an army in town.

468
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:01,003
Military grade firepower, high volume.

469
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:04,674
- Who's the supplier, Turk?
- You think I know?

470
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,009
Shit like that's so high above my pay grade--

471
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,471
I'm telling you the truth, man.

472
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,314
That tin in my trunk couldn't kill a rabbit.

473
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,059
Okay, okay!
Okay, listen.

474
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,730
I did hear somethin' from a guy in Rikers.

475
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:20,064
It's got to do with Fisk.

476
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,026
- Fisk is gone.
- Yeah,

477
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,238
but once you took care of him,
what'd you think was gonna happen?

478
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:31,033
Every gang worth shit's trying
to grab up everything fat boy left behind.

479
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,244
I even heard the cartel's getting into it.

480
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,830
They're bringing up some heavy munitions from Juárez.

481
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,332
Military grade.

482
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,126
- Where?
- Warehouse.

483
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:43,838
Meatpacking District, 13th Street and something,

484
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,882
I swear I'm telling you all I know.

485
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,392
Listen, man.

486
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,435
I gave you what you wanted.

487
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,771
My hand's busted,

488
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:02,189
I got all this glass I gotta replace now.

489
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:06,318
Maybe, just let a brother go, huh?

490
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,114
Come on, D.

491
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,283
I'm out on parole, man.

492
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,911
I can't go back to jail.
Please.

493
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,328
I missed Hell's Kitchen.

494
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,622
Yeah.

495
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,999
It didn't miss you.

496
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,211
Fine.

497
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,548
Know what?
Be like that.

498
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,802
'Cause we both know I'll be back out
by the end of the month--

499
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,641
I'll see you then.

500
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,611
Members only, pork chop.

501
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,863
It's okay, I'm meeting a friend.

502
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,741
Get lost or get hurt.

503
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:58,412
He's a full-patch member of the Dogs of Hell.

504
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,122
I swear, I just need to talk to him.

505
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,749
What's this big shot's name?

506
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,167
Smitty.

507
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,337
Don't move.

508
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,393
Does it look like I'm packing?

509
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,270
Gonna wish you were.

510
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:29,485
Come with me.

511
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,552
Look at this asshole.

512
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,690
Says he's here to see Smitty.

513
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,279
Old friend.

514
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,448
- Old friend?
- Yeah.

515
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:19,285
Third grade.
Sister Haney's class?

516
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,245
She really had it in for us.

517
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,874
Is he around or should I just--
Ow! No, no, no, no!

518
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,793
Holy shit!

519
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,048
- What's your name?
- Foggy! Franklin Nelson!

520
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,341
Never heard of you.

521
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:37,553
I've known Smitty for a long time.

522
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,889
Oh, yeah? Me, too.

523
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,933
Obviously, we went on different
career paths along the way--

524
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,851
- Is this funny to you?
- No.

525
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,020
- No, sir.
- 'Cause I'm two seconds away

526
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,773
- from slitting your throat.
- I'm not a cop, okay?

527
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,484
You a fed?

528
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,903
I'm a lawyer.

529
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,990
Look, I just--
I just need five minutes

530
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:01,160
with Smitty and then I swear, I'm gone.

531
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,369
Yeah, you're gone now.

532
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:06,082
Ever walk back in here again,
and you'll leave in pieces.

533
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,042
Nod if you understand me.

534
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,925
Take him out back,
show him how we feel about lawyers.

535
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,248
No, please, no, no, no, no, no.

536
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,397
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you down.

537
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,525
I'm gonna get you down.
I'm gonna get you down.

538
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,535
It was a mistake coming here, I realize that.

539
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:31,245
- Shut up!
- I just wanted to help people, I swear.

540
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,705
- Smitty would understand!
- Smitty's dead, asshole.

541
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:34,999
What?

542
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,420
You have to believe me,
I... I didn't know that.

543
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:40,796
Oh, I believe there's a lot you don't know.

544
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,089
Whoa, okay, look.

545
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:45,009
Smitty was a long time ago.

546
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,261
Couple years ago, I helped a guy named Foster.

547
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,013
- He was a biker!
- Not one of ours.

548
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,556
- Ricky Wex?
- Shut up!

549
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,099
I helped a guy named Pope!

550
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:56,979
Yeah, the VA said that his injuries
weren't sustained during battle,

551
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:58,689
but they were!

552
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:01,567
They just didn't manifest themselves for 20 years.

553
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,570
Uh, we got his operation sorted and then,

554
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,822
a couple of months later, he was back on his Harley,

555
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:09,992
doing whatever it is you guys do.
Which is none of my business!

556
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:12,954
You helped Pope?

557
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,375
Get the hell out of here.

558
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:21,795
- Really?
- Now!

559
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,177
What happened to Smitty?

560
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:32,723
- You serious?
- I came here for a reason.

561
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,225
I just need answers!

562
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:37,894
Look, if I don't get answers,
a lot of innocent blood could be shed.

563
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:41,398
People who both you and I care about
are gonna get hurt.

564
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:43,650
And you don't seem like the most sentimental guy,

565
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:46,070
but you're still listening.

566
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:51,283
And that knife isn't in my neck,
so I have to believe that right now...

567
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,162
maybe you and I are on the same side.

568
00:40:56,747 --> 00:41:00,209
You got guts, Harvard. I'll give you that.

569
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:05,464
Columbia, actually, but it's not courage.

570
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,258
It's more like sheer adrenaline.

571
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:10,594
Hey, look, I wouldn't be asking,

572
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:15,266
I wouldn't be here doing this if it wasn't important.

573
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:27,861
Smitty was on a run,

574
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,073
I-90 with four brothers, transporting a big score.

575
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:35,369
They were hit by a goddamn army.
Their whole crew was cut to pieces.

576
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,038
Left there like roadkill.

577
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:39,248
- Any idea who did it?
- Nah.

578
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:42,459
New crew, doesn't matter.
Whoever they are, we're gonna find 'em.

579
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:45,879
And when we do, you wanna be
very far away from the action.

580
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,883
You didn't hear none of this from me.
Now go.

581
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:52,886
And don't come back.

582
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:09,028
I always knew the devil would come for me.

583
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:12,281
But I thought I would be dead first.

584
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,325
- I'm gonna get some help.
- No!

585
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:16,827
No... no...

586
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,169
Who did this?

587
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,629
No one escapes this.

588
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:31,675
No one can get away.

589
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:34,511
Tell me.

590
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,188
Tell me who they are.

591
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:49,943
No "they."

592
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,528
Him.

593
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,448
It's one man.

594
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,311
Hold it right there.

595
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:31,067
Oh, my God!

596
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,488
Oh, God.

597
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:36,072
What was that?

598
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:38,409
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

599
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,993
Shit.

600
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,662
Someone's come to finish the job.

601
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:43,414
Shh! Don't move.

602
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,624
No, to hell with that.

603
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,924
He's got a gun!

604
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,510
Shit.

605
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,804
Come on, come on, come on!

606
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:00,597
Come on!

607
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,008
Dear God.

608
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,469
Shit.

609
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:40,512
What? You--
You don't have the right keys?

610
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,848
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Is this even your car?

611
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,058
- Belonged to a friend.
- Where's he?

612
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,394
He's dead.

613
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,146
Get in!

614
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:47,931
Bang.
