1
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,371
Christ almighty.

2
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,166
What the hell happened here?

3
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,459
Please.

4
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:45,254
They need medical attention.
Please. Please.

5
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:46,422
Thompson, help them.

6
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,258
Got it.

7
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,055
Daniel, look at me.

8
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:00,562
Jesus Christ.

9
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,992
Don't let any of 'em out your sight, okay?

10
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,160
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,122
Okay, guys, come over here.
Um, I wanna make sure we cordon off...

12
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,794
- ETA on the ambulances.
- They're two out, sir.

13
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:29,799
I need five of 'em to... 54 St. Mark's, right away.

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,138
Mahoney.

15
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,694
Let me guess.
You're the one who found 'em.

16
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:53,572
The cages, the medical tubing.
They were being drained.

17
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,366
- For what?
- Doesn't matter.

18
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,410
We need to find the people who did this to them.

19
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,204
It would be a good start if you told me who that was.

20
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,540
You see anyone down there?

21
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,377
No.

22
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:11,007
But you could start with the Yakuza.

23
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,384
- "Start with"?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,969
Shit!

25
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,596
You saying the Yakuza is mixed up with another group?

26
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:19,849
I think so.

27
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:23,061
That's scarier than all this
cult-looking ritual shit put together.

28
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:27,732
This group... they got a name?

29
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:29,818
- I'm working on it.
- Yeah, I'll bet you are.

30
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:32,445
Listen, these victims, they need
to be taken somewhere off the grid,

31
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,655
somewhere they can't be found.

32
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:35,531
No. What they need is medical attention.

33
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,241
I know, and they'll get it, but--

34
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,365
Whatever was being done to them, it may not be over.

35
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,995
We need to get them somewhere safe.

36
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,956
Yeah, that might not be a bad idea.

37
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,290
All Saints is closest--

38
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,042
No, take them to Metro-General.

39
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,252
I know someone there we can trust. But...

40
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,214
no one can know you're bringing them in.

41
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,548
I'm on it.

42
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,760
And just know, someday...

43
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:57,553
I'ma tell you how to do your job.

44
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:15,488
Thompson, I need a favor.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,867
Got the last one.

46
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,452
And he's burning up.
I need a cooling blanket and ice packs.

47
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,246
We're out.

48
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,081
Jesus. Uh...

49
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,250
Vending machine.

50
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,586
Next floor down.
Get all the cold sodas you can.

51
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,029
- Okay.
- Apply them on their wrists.

52
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,339
We need to get the fever down.

53
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,758
Thanks for this.

54
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,259
Thank administration.

55
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,594
They've taken six months to remodel this wing.

56
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,138
Anything happens, you let me know.

57
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,348
I'll keep a few PD here, and more downstairs.

58
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,017
- Okay.
- And do me a favor?

59
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,061
Keep the details of this arrangement to yourself.

60
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:48,980
Details?

61
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,439
Our mutual friend.

62
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,526
I have no idea what you're talking about.

63
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:57,405
This ain't like any overdose I've ever seen.

64
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,365
Yeah, their systems are in free fall.

65
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:03,286
- Holy shit.
- What?

66
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:04,578
She's got no prints.

67
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,292
Her fingertips were burnt off.

68
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,921
Her, too.

69
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,630
IDing 'em is gonna be fun.

70
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,340
What kind of junkies do this?

71
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,551
Yeah, I think this was done to them.

72
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:22,221
Let's just get them stable.
One headache at a time.

73
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,191
You.

74
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,193
And here I was hoping my day would get worse.

75
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,071
- Hi, Claire.
- Five patients, non-responsive,

76
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:40,907
high fever, no fingerprints.

77
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,242
You wanna tell me what kind of shit storm
you just rained down on me?

78
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:44,702
It's why I'm here.

79
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,708
In here.

80
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:56,380
What's the story?

81
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,506
It's, um...

82
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,259
it's complicated.

83
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,386
Always is with you.

84
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,638
Remember the last time you patched me up?

85
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,640
When you were cut to shreds?

86
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,561
Kinda hard to forget.

87
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,396
Well, the same guy who did that to me,

88
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,066
he's the one responsible for your five new patients.

89
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:17,276
Nobu.

90
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:19,821
You said he burned to death.

91
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,030
Yeah.

92
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,283
I was wrong.

93
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,998
There's gotta be more to the story than that.

94
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,292
For now...

95
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,045
I need you to know that every one
of these people is still in real danger.

96
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,507
Okay, I have checked their vitals.
I know, they're hanging by a thread.

97
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,927
No. Claire, I mean...
even if you manage to save their lives,

98
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,096
someone may still come to kill them.

99
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:47,181
And the people who gave them aid?

100
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:48,807
Most likely.

101
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:50,851
Yes.

102
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,896
Wow, Matt. I...

103
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,648
I really have not missed you at all.

104
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,859
But, look, Claire, nobody knows they're here.

105
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,404
And I'm gonna offer you all the protection I can.

106
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,448
Plus, you can still send them away.

107
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,911
You know I can't do that.

108
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,121
Thank you.

109
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,497
It's why I came to you.

110
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,876
Are you hurt?

111
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,213
Yeah...

112
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,381
a little.

113
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,840
"A little"?

114
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,805
Oh.

115
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,515
That's...

116
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,766
Bone bruise.

117
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,102
A fractured rib, most likely.

118
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,396
It's probably busted, knowing you.

119
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,943
I'll say this about you, Matt Murdock.

120
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,070
You are a lot of bad things.

121
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,238
Boring is not one of them.

122
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:46,950
Here.

123
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,452
- What is it?
- Two aspirin.

124
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,162
Catholic morphine. Take it.

125
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,496
I don't know.

126
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,834
I'm...

127
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,919
All units, suspect Frank Castle.

128
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:01,047
Believed to be armed and extremely dangerous.

129
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:04,008
I should've known this day would get worse.

130
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,510
I want this out across all five boroughs.

131
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,347
And get some additional units
to the courthouse and City Hall.

132
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,015
- Do it. Move!
- Son of a bitch.

133
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,141
What is it?

134
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,602
The Punisher.

135
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,271
He just escaped.

136
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,635
- Miss Page?
- Yeah.

137
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,054
Agent Gallagher. Follow me.

138
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,721
I'll get you through security as quickly as possible.

139
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,015
Thank you.

140
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,103
Excuse us.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

141
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:40,271
Sorry.

142
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:42,731
Wait here.

143
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,317
Hey.

144
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,235
Guess I'm not the only one
that got Reyes's invitation.

145
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:48,737
Security is nuts.

146
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,199
Frank Castle's on the loose.
I wouldn't take any chances either.

147
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,742
No, not even Frank could have
orchestrated an escape that quickly.

148
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,994
How's that even possible?

149
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:00,416
Guessing that's what the District Attorney
wants to ask us.

150
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,626
This case just keeps serving up the shit burgers.

151
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,171
- Mr. Nelson, this way.
- See you on the other side.

152
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,380
Yeah.

153
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,304
Excuse me, sir.
Do you need a hand?

154
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,348
No, thank you.
Thank you so much.

155
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:32,740
I, uh, see Reyes... dragged you in, too.

156
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,991
Karen?

157
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:37,495
Are you all right?

158
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,706
Other than being hauled in as a suspect
in the escape of a confessed murderer?

159
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,750
Yeah, I'm great.

160
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,504
Yeah, this whole case has been a disaster.

161
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,132
I'm sorry I pulled you guys into it.

162
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,384
Don't be sorry.

163
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,389
How are you otherwise?

164
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,849
Good. Yeah, I'm good.

165
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,354
Good.

166
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,688
Miss Page?

167
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,023
- Come with me.
- Yeah.

168
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,691
Mr. Murdock, I'll be right back.

169
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:11,654
According to my buddy,

170
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,531
Reyes is most likely about to grill us like fish.

171
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,907
She has no cause.

172
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,870
On paper, we're still Frank Castle's attorneys.

173
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,036
And I am so proud of that.

174
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,289
Frank's out, but instead of going after him herself,

175
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,541
Reyes is dragging us into the lion's den.

176
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,460
What could we possibly know about his escape?

177
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,212
Precisely dick.

178
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,839
But if Reyes can find a way
to blame us for all this, she will.

179
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,800
Karen, you spent the most time with him.

180
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,177
He say anything?

181
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,844
Anything at all that could help us right now?

182
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,181
Nothing about an escape.

183
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,391
I went over Castle's transfer work.

184
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,603
He wasn't waltzing into some country club.

185
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,981
They were burying him
in their highest security control unit...

186
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,276
with all the other rock stars on cell block D.

187
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,035
Uh, Matt... this way.

188
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,332
Hey, Foggy.
You said cell block D?

189
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,709
- It'll be just another minute.
- Thanks.

190
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,085
Does that mean something to you?

191
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,297
Yeah, I like to keep track of the people
who might want to kill us.

192
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,966
- The Punisher?
- No, not Frank. Wilson Fisk.

193
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,052
Frank blows his trial,
and ends up on Fisk's cell block?

194
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,263
And a day later, he's on the street.

195
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:21,056
Uh, those are two very separate dots.

196
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,808
- You can't just connect them.
- Oh, come on, Foggy.

197
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,143
I'm right.
Fisk made this happen.

198
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,565
She'll see you now.

199
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,068
Ma'am?

200
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,279
They're here now.

201
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:38,782
Yes. As soon as possible.
Please, as soon as possible.

202
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,286
Thank you for coming.

203
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,417
Kinda hard to say no when the cops pick you up.

204
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,750
Well, I'm sorry about that.
Could you, uh--

205
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,585
Please, have a seat.

206
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,297
Please.

207
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,467
The second chair.

208
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,414
I don't know what your play is, lady,
but let's cut the shit.

209
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,415
You brought us in expecting to sweat

210
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,896
privileged information about our client out of us.

211
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,276
Yes... if that helps.

212
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:16,445
We have to get Frank Castle off the street
before anyone else gets hurt.

213
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,322
You're asking for favors,
after all the shit you've pulled?

214
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:20,741
If you want our cooperation,

215
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,868
then we need to know what you know... all right?

216
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,245
All of your cards on the table, right now.

217
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,458
I've made mistakes.

218
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,378
Excuse me?

219
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,712
Central Park.

220
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,466
Castle and his family.
I screwed up.

221
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,052
Frank Castle's family being gunned down

222
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,345
is not a mistake, it's a massacre.

223
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,972
Wait. I swear to God, if I had any idea
that people might get hurt,

224
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,391
- I would not have done that.
- You--

225
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,184
Your office were part of it?

226
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,727
Why am I not surprised?

227
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,604
They were more than just part of it.

228
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:51,855
It was a sting.

229
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,441
How do you know that?

230
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,569
I've gotten really good at digging up shit
people like you wanna keep buried.

231
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:57,736
Hey, Karen. Just...

232
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,947
- Probably not a good idea.
- Trust me.

233
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,533
Ma'am... they need to know.

234
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,044
Last year, the DA's office learned
there was a new player in the drug trade.

235
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,879
Calls himself the Blacksmith.

236
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,674
He wasn't gonna flood the market,
he was gonna be the market.

237
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,885
And we were tracking kilos,
but this guy dealt in metric tons.

238
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,931
Volume like that should have made him
easy to find, but he was a ghost.

239
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,334
No sign of how he was getting
the product into the country,

240
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,936
where it was coming from, nothing.

241
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,023
Then one of the cops we planted
deep undercover got word

242
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,611
that the Blacksmith was arranging
a meet between three unaffiliated gangs.

243
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,279
Dogs of Hell, Kitchen Irish, and the Mexican Cartel.

244
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,323
Blacksmith wanted to broker a deal.

245
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,993
They set the meet for Central Park, midafternoon.

246
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,746
Look, our guys were there.
They were ready.

247
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,789
But the sting, it just, it... it went south.

248
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,625
You didn't clear the park, did you?

249
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,878
I thought about it.

250
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,381
But I decided an empty park could show our hand.

251
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,383
So, yes...

252
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,885
I greenlit the operation...

253
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,429
civilian traffic and all.

254
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,474
And it, oh-so-predictably, all went to shit.

255
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,936
Blacksmith didn't show.

256
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,148
Before we had a chance to move in...

257
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,860
the gangs got rattled and opened fire on each other.

258
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,489
Our undercover was killed and Castle's family--

259
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,823
God damn it.

260
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,744
So after that horrible decision, you made it worse.

261
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,872
You tried to kill him and ruin us
to save your own political ass.

262
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,374
You know what, lady, you're on your own.

263
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:37,961
Wait, wait.
This is not about me anymore.

264
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:41,715
I found this in my daughter's backpack
before sending her off to school.

265
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,092
X-ray of a skull.

266
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:45,719
Castle.

267
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,221
You know once he gets his sights
set on a target, he never stops--

268
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,905
- Where's your daughter now?
- Upstate...

269
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,100
New York somewhere,
in a location I can never know about,

270
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:56,063
surrounded by men with guns...
assigned to protect her.

271
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,857
My baby girl.

272
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:03,028
Ms. Reyes, it's highly unlikely
Frank Castle would target your family.

273
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,323
I-- This is hard to understand,
but he has his own internal code--

274
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,951
I'm sorry, am I supposed to trust that?

275
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,831
I don't care how much time you spent
in an interrogation room with him.

276
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,166
He's coming after my child.

277
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,418
What do you want from us?

278
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,169
If he contacts you, just let us know.

279
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,838
You want us to break privilege?

280
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,215
I wanna make sure that nobody else gets hurt.

281
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,717
Look, I...

282
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,177
I know what I've done here.

283
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,597
But please.

284
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,850
I don't give a shit about my job anymore.

285
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,478
I just wanna keep my family safe.

286
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,521
Get down!

287
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,250
How you feel?

288
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,295
Like I've been shot.

289
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,673
He says I'll be fine, though.

290
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,885
Right.

291
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,053
Matt, don't.

292
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,686
- I have to find him, Foggy.
- Good idea.

293
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,437
Strike now, while the police have his whereabouts

294
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,022
narrowed down to the island of Manhattan.

295
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,483
- I know where to start.
- You always know where to start.

296
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,318
You just never know when to stop, Matt.

297
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,154
I'm not asking for your permission.
All right? I'll see ya.

298
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,825
Sorry.

299
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,080
Hey. Where's Matt going?

300
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,708
Why ask me?

301
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,598
I spent nights looking
at Frank Castle's crime scenes.

302
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,725
They look so different from the inside.

303
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,935
You knew about Reyes and the cover-up the whole time.

304
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,771
I suspected.

305
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:28,150
But the cover-up was well underway
before I started at the DA's office.

306
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,069
But you don't get it.

307
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,155
If it came out that civilians
were killed on her watch...

308
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,783
a war hero, no less...
her career would have been over.

309
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,575
Tower, she's dead now.

310
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,707
I can't...

311
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,585
Uh...

312
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:52,424
She was altering medical records, police reports.

313
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,261
Getting sloppier every time.

314
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,682
She was covering her tracks,
but the trail just kept spreading wider.

315
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,309
And when I caught wind of it, my hands were tied.

316
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,632
It was... it was just too late.

317
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:06,313
But I couldn't let myself go down with her.

318
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,023
So you slipped Karen the X-ray.

319
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,401
Reyes ordered the DNR on Castle?

320
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,195
His family was gone.

321
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,823
Castle was hanging by a thread.
She just wanted the problem to go away.

322
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,365
Well, it didn't.

323
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,992
Castle didn't die.

324
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,788
The man just murdered...

325
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,960
a New York District Attorney,
and anyone who crossed him could be next.

326
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,422
I'm sorry... I'm sorry for your loss.

327
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,801
I'm gonna get the hell out of town for a while.

328
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,679
If I were you, I'd do the same.

329
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,186
How bad is it?

330
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,605
They're gonna take some X-rays, just in case.

331
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,150
- I'll come.
- No, that's okay.

332
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,569
Really, I'm good alone.
I don't need you.

333
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,490
Do me a favor. Watch your back.

334
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,424
I'll need you to sign an affidavit...

335
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,927
agreeing to our terms, before you can see my client.

336
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,345
Of course.

337
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,515
It's in braille.

338
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:28,061
Mr. Fisk requested that I accommodate
your... particular disability.

339
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,398
He's a very thoughtful man.

340
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:37,487
You will not come into
physical contact with Mr. Fisk.

341
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,656
You will not discuss your conversation with Mr. Fisk

342
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,827
with any media outlet, government entity,
law enforcement agency,

343
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,954
or outside party of any kind.

344
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:50,000
Failure to do so will result in severe
financial penalties, detailed there.

345
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:54,797
You will refer to Mr. Fisk only as "Mr. Fisk,"

346
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,009
and he will not answer any questions
until I personally approve of them first.

347
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,469
That's a lot of rules.

348
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:04,765
Rules are what separate us
from the animals, Mr. Murdock.

349
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,518
Thank you.

350
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,481
Excellent.

351
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:22,157
Straight ahead.

352
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,141
On the left, sir.

353
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,278
Mind the cane.

354
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:29,307
You have ten minutes, Mr. Murdock.

355
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,859
We met once before, you and I.

356
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,154
Before you went after me in court.

357
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,198
Do you remember?

358
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,785
It was at an art gallery, several months ago.

359
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,579
I assume you've heard there's been
a shooting at the courthouse?

360
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,124
Unfortunate news.

361
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,044
But why does that send you to me?

362
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,505
Because I know you facilitated Frank Castle's escape.

363
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,342
Why would I do that?

364
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,596
Frank Castle's path and mine are so clearly separate.

365
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,015
Lack of motive.

366
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,938
Enough to throw any rational
law enforcement agency way off your trail.

367
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,606
But I'm not biting.

368
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,899
Not biting.

369
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,111
He's not biting, Donovan.
Barking!

370
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:25,238
It's what you do.

371
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,157
The scheming, the machinations.

372
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,953
Frank Castle is a killing machine,
and you set him free.

373
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:33,455
Which means you're aiming a loose cannon at someone,

374
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,706
and we both know it.

375
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,541
And you can prove that in a court of law?

376
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,792
Where is Frank Castle?

377
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,169
Not here.

378
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,967
Did you have anything to do with his release?

379
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,134
You don't have to answer that.

380
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,719
No, I didn't.

381
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,472
Clock's ticking, Mr. Murdock.

382
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,935
These days are hectic in Hell's Kitchen.

383
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:59,272
Lunatic shooters, gang wars.

384
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,195
I understand you're frantic,
you're looking for answers.

385
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,738
I have none.

386
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:13,661
Sometimes I'm glad I'm... in here.

387
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,915
The fate of New York City
is out of my hands for once.

388
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,543
That's bullshit!

389
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,553
I don't know what you expect from me...

390
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,557
but we're finished here.

391
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:38,686
Mr. Donovan.

392
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,402
Vanessa.

393
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,741
You asked me if I remember the art gallery.
I do.

394
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,120
I remember her very well.

395
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,205
Hmm.

396
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:02,585
She's out of the country.
She, uh... wants to come back.

397
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,755
Leave us.

398
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,642
So listen to me very closely.

399
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:18,726
Hmm.

400
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,980
I will use every legal loophole and footnote...

401
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,025
to make certain that never happens.

402
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:32,115
You see, unlike your other adversaries, Mr. Fisk...

403
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,452
I can break you without breaking a single law.

404
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,746
You may have expensive lawyers,

405
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,042
but with one envelope and $6 postage...

406
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:47,630
I can make sure Vanessa never
sets foot on American soil again.

407
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,343
One letter to the right office...

408
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,470
and I get her visa pulled.

409
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,101
I can prove she was an accomplice
to every one of your crimes.

410
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,067
And now you're thinking you can serve your sentence,

411
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,570
hop on a jet, go to her whenever you like.

412
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:15,533
Live somewhere like Monaco, or...

413
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:19,036
I don't know, wherever the hell
you fat cats go to sun yourselves.

414
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:20,622
But you can't.

415
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:26,043
You can visit her, but you'll never live with her.

416
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:30,132
Because this is New York, Wilson.
You live here.

417
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:34,010
This is your jungle.
This is your blood, like it is mine.

418
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:39,182
She will never come...

419
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,892
and you'll never leave.

420
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,437
You screw with me now, just a little bit...

421
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:48,566
and you'll never really be with your
one and only Vanessa ever again.

422
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,408
Speak her name again!
Go ahead!

423
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,497
Yes, the son of a boxer.

424
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,957
You...

425
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,709
You are running this place.

426
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,211
Yeah, you did set him free.

427
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,713
You ask such small questions, Mr. Murdock.

428
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,258
I know you're regaining power in here.

429
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,885
Yes, ask my lawyer. He'll deny it.

430
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,012
Ask the guards! They'll deny it.

431
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,931
Ask the inmates here.

432
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,225
They'll cut their tongues out before they talk.

433
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,894
But I have something to say to you.

434
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,855
When I finally get out of this cage...

435
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:32,652
I will dismantle the lives of the two
amateurs that put me in here!

436
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,324
You, Mr. Murdock, and Franklin Percy Nelson.

437
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,451
No, I-- I put you here, not Nelson.

438
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:40,577
- No.
- I did it.

439
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,037
The two of you took the laurels.
You'll both take the blame.

440
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,498
I'll chop both the heads off of that snake,

441
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:50,462
and I'll spend more than $6
on postage to bring you down!

442
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:55,383
You see, I've had a lot of time to reflect
on my journey here, Mr. Murdock!

443
00:27:56,718 --> 00:28:00,763
My mistakes, everything I took for granted.

444
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:06,228
And while I try and sleep in this bleak place...

445
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:09,314
the one thing that keeps me warm...

446
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:13,526
is the thought that I will look down upon this city,

447
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,696
the city that birthed me,

448
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:20,617
with the woman that I love, who...

449
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,454
whom I love with everything that I am.

450
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:29,792
If you're worried that Frank Castle
will wreak havoc on Hell's Kitchen...

451
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,343
...just wait.

452
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,560
Time's up, Mr. Murdock.

453
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:51,188
Okay.

454
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,609
Let's do this again sometime.

455
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,018
Mmm, okay, so everyone's got somebody down there.

456
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,937
Do we have anybody on the scene?

457
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,939
I know we got Manus at Metro-General.

458
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,191
Look, send Stantacki down to the police department,

459
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,277
and, Sarah, why don't you get
to the fire department, all right?

460
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,529
We're gonna use the top one, okay?

461
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:42,407
What are you guys looking at me for?
Will you just get to work?

462
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,077
Holy shit!

463
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,414
Karen.
Tell me you were there.

464
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,957
- I was there.
- Yeah--

465
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,668
Uh, well, do you need anything?
A med eval, maybe a blanket?

466
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:54,877
Next dumb question.

467
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,481
Hey, hey, will you just wait a minute?

468
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,632
- So, was this Frank Castle?
- That's what I wanna figure out.

469
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,758
- What does your gut tell you?
- No!

470
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:03,135
No, my gut is the last thing I can trust.
I need facts.

471
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,261
Okay, agreed.

472
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:05,805
All right. So if Castle did this, if...

473
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,474
- Uh-huh.
- ...he's not gonna stop.

474
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,392
Well, we gotta stay ahead of him here.
He took out the DA.

475
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:10,518
No-- Allegedly.

476
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,061
Fine. Who would be next on his shortlist?

477
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,480
Whoever crossed him.

478
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,482
I'm thinking a medical examiner
who falsified records?

479
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:16,608
- Tepper.
- Exactly.

480
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,610
He's probably still holed up at that shit-ass motel.

481
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,820
Right. So, I was gonna go over there now.

482
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:22,989
Not alone, you're not.

483
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:28,870
Let's go.

484
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,581
Tequila.

485
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,083
Mezcal, if you have it.

486
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,257
Sounds great.
Same for me.

487
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,429
Thank you.

488
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,850
Thanks.

489
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:36,479
Is that a French accent I hear?

490
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:39,065
You tell me?

491
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,275
The whole bottle, please.

492
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,454
Another for the lady?

493
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,251
Where are you headed?

494
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,800
Far away. New York is over.

495
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:10,555
Winter jacket. Gorsuch.

496
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,976
Ski trip...

497
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:16,686
Courchevel?

498
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:23,818
Far too early for Courchevel,
and anyway I prefer St. Moritz.

499
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,779
Shopping and slopes.

500
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:33,077
For a start, both my feet hurt
after a while. I'll need a bath.

501
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,704
I can draw one for you.

502
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,294
In a tub for two?

503
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:43,546
But of course.

504
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,882
How nice.

505
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,176
I get so lonely.

506
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,487
I guarantee that will not be a problem.

507
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:53,723
You're a gentleman.

508
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,975
Not always.

509
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,560
Good.

510
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:02,398
New York is done.
Hello to...?

511
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:04,484
Jacques.

512
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,318
Jacques Duchamps.

513
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:07,612
Louise Badeaux.

514
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:12,950
Louise. Funny...

515
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,747
I thought your name was Elektra.

516
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,001
How do you know my name?

517
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,004
I know who you are.

518
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,633
I know what you've done, and who you have killed.

519
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,259
The list is long.

520
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,096
The pilot in Buenos Aires, the lawyer in Berlin...

521
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,224
and that very messy episode in Morocco.

522
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,895
I'm still trying to understand how one woman

523
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:44,190
can fit six bodies in the trunk of a Maserati.

524
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,111
Are you gonna try to kill me?

525
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,114
Something like that.

526
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,827
Well, you ought to know...

527
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,957
it's rude to keep a girl waiting.

528
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,232
Just one body.

529
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,860
Shit-ton of bullets, and a whole lot of blood.

530
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,113
All signs point to Frank Castle.

531
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,323
- No, no. Uh, it's not his style.
- Wait, wait, wait.

532
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,617
No, really, I, I know him.
He wouldn't--

533
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,702
What do you mean, "Not his style"?
Come here...

534
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:41,956
Look, you wanna report the news,
or you wanna really get to the truth?

535
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,626
The first step is you gotta
put aside your personal feelings.

536
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,962
I-- I mean about everything.
No matter how much it hurts.

537
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,590
This is not personal.
I'm just saying that this does not fit.

538
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:52,925
All right, this is just--
That's just out of control.

539
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:56,846
Yeah, it's out of control because
Frank's a killer, all right? That's chaos.

540
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:01,142
Whatever good you saw, whatever...

541
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:05,062
you know, code of honor that you understood...

542
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:06,981
it was never there.

543
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:11,694
- You think I projected?
- Yeah.

544
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,614
Happens to the best of us.

545
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,658
Although, you know, why you'd
wanna see good in the man

546
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:20,077
- who pulls the trigger is...
- beyond me, but...

547
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,498
Do you know anybody else who might be in danger?

548
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,251
Um...

549
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,879
Yes, uh, his nurse.
Uh, he's a janitor now.

550
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,463
- And there's some others.
- Okay, okay. So-- So, listen.

551
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,257
You gotta... you gotta get those names, all right?

552
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,843
We have to hand everything we have to the NYPD.

553
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,054
We need to save as many people as we can.

554
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,306
Yeah. I've got all the files
at my apartment. I could go right now.

555
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,224
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

556
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,730
Guys, can you come here?

557
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,819
Uh, what's this?

558
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:56,113
Oh, well, they're, um... they're going with you.

559
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:57,614
- Are you serious?
- Mmm, yeah.

560
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,867
Yeah, I had one last string to pull,
so don't screw it up, okay?

561
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:02,369
No, Frank's not gonna hurt me.

562
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:03,746
Frank's a psycho killer.

563
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,707
You would never have pulled this
patriarchal shit with Ben.

564
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,208
I can take care of myself.

565
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,500
You're right.

566
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,712
And I'll never make that mistake again.

567
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,173
Not about someone I care about.

568
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,552
- Okay.
- Go, go, go.

569
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,304
Get the files.

570
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,098
Meet me back at the office in an hour.

571
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,933
Yeah. I'll be there.

572
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,353
Don't forget you owe me a cup of coffee!

573
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,794
Where am I?

574
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:54,380
Hey.

575
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,883
You're in Metro-General, and you're safe.

576
00:36:58,134 --> 00:36:59,343
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

577
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,429
Lie very, very still.
You've been very ill.

578
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,891
Do you remember what happened?

579
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,814
Can you feel this?

580
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,442
Good.

581
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:16,736
Daniel.

582
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,196
Your father's here.

583
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,572
Thank you.

584
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,034
Is he okay?

585
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:27,038
Yeah. He's weak, and he'll need another transfusion,

586
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,330
but he's coherent.

587
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,917
Hopefully the others will respond the same way.

588
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,376
I don't know how to repay you.

589
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,171
Trust me, billing will find you.

590
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,591
I'll give you two a minute to catch up,

591
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,436
but then the police will be wanting
to question him sooner than later.

592
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,013
Yes, of course.

593
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,773
I'm... so sorry.

594
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,192
This is all my fault.

595
00:37:57,193 --> 00:38:00,446
I promise... it's going to be better now.

596
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,207
Always the last place you look.

597
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,169
But you knew I was coming, huh?

598
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,629
I heard you.

599
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,049
Three stories down.

600
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,718
You do know that sounds creepy, right?

601
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,098
Yeah, I've been told.

602
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:28,557
I brought you coffee.

603
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,934
No, thanks.

604
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:34,605
Right. Forgot, you like to suffer.

605
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,401
Well, the joke's on you...

606
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,821
'cause our vending machine coffee really sucks.

607
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,145
Thought you'd be with your friend.

608
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,293
Aren't you gonna ask me how he's doing?

609
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,922
He's fine.
He's watching the game.

610
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,758
Jets are up, seven-nothing.

611
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,220
Ah, he just changed the channel.

612
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:08,973
The hit was clean.

613
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:10,599
In and out.

614
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,019
They'll release him tomorrow.

615
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,942
You know, the bullet wound will
do wonders for his career in hip-hop.

616
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,821
You should pay him a visit.

617
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:26,866
I can't help him, Claire.

618
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,284
How do you know that?

619
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,452
- 'Cause he got shot.
- Not by you.

620
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:32,454
No, but I dragged him into this mess.

621
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,082
Maybe. Maybe...

622
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,212
Or maybe you need to start thinking about
climbing down off that cross of yours,

623
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:43,465
and spending some time
with us normal people for a change.

624
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:48,888
How are the other patients?

625
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:51,432
Alive... thanks to you.

626
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:54,226
You brought them in just in time.

627
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,938
And one's awake.

628
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,817
What do they remember?

629
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:04,028
Nothing yet.
He's in and out.

630
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:07,489
But I got all their toxicology screens
back from the lab, though,

631
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:11,035
and they read like a cheap science-fiction novel.

632
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,869
What's the report?

633
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:16,748
Eight separate unidentified
organic substances in their bloodstreams,

634
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,543
or what was left of their bloodstreams.

635
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,421
- What do you mean?
- They didn't just lose blood...

636
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,423
they were drained.

637
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:25,716
All of them.

638
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:29,845
Each bled, carefully, systematically...

639
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,139
probably for several months.

640
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:35,767
Yeah. Nobu took blood out,
but you're saying he put toxins in?

641
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:36,978
One of our doctors thinks that

642
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:42,024
maybe they were being used to incubate
the substances in their systems.

643
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,110
- Like human chemical farms...
- Jesus.

644
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:46,070
...that could be tapped as needed.

645
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,283
God!

646
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,410
I should have stopped this.

647
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,912
You know you kind of did, right?

648
00:40:55,997 --> 00:40:57,498
Yeah, not soon enough.

649
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,168
I don't believe this.

650
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,134
Hey, uh, St. Matthew...

651
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:10,261
enough with the hair shirt, already.

652
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:12,471
You know, we've got doctors on it.

653
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,390
Cops, labs...

654
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,392
You're not the only person in Hell's Kitchen

655
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:18,602
who gives a shit about what's going on here.

656
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,773
You look like hell, you know that?

657
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:26,068
And you're standing up here,
freezing your ass off playing guard dog

658
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:29,155
when what you really need
is probably three days' sleep.

659
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:32,324
Yeah, 'cause Nobu's gonna figure out where we are.

660
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:34,493
And when he does, I wanna be here.

661
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:36,537
Of course, you do.

662
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,830
Claire, what do you...
what do you expect from me, all right?

663
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,541
I'm flailing here.
A dead guy...

664
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:44,961
A guy I witnessed burned to death,
is somehow back in Hell's Kitchen.

665
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,584
All right?
On top of that, Frank Castle kills the DA,

666
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,800
and Wilson Fisk runs the prison that I sent him to.

667
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,343
How do you know that?

668
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:54,721
I went there.

669
00:41:58,017 --> 00:41:59,518
Busy boy.

670
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:05,066
Oh, jeez.
I thought it could work. I did.

671
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,776
The law...
But it feels useless.

672
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,029
Everything I do just gets undone.

673
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:15,951
You're talking to someone who patches up
the same three crackheads every night.

674
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:19,455
I understand what it's like to be pulled
in a hundred different directions at once.

675
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:21,415
Not like this.

676
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,791
I'm done, Claire.

677
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,671
No more law. No more friends.

678
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,841
At best, they're a distraction.
At worst...

679
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,052
I put them in jeopardy.

680
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,182
From now on, I need to focus.

681
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:42,353
You may feel like you are a ship lost at sea,

682
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:45,397
but if you isolate like this,
then you really will be.

683
00:42:46,357 --> 00:42:48,192
You're cutting off your own anchor.

684
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:49,568
Yeah.

685
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:56,283
And every minute that you spend...
standing, hiding in this suit of armor,

686
00:42:56,367 --> 00:43:00,287
the more separate you become from
the very things that you wanna protect.

687
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:03,457
Your friend is in a hospital bed downstairs.

688
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,838
Stop playing the loneliest little soldier,
and come downstairs.

689
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:14,009
Be a human being... and come say "hi."

690
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,929
That's all you gotta do.

691
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:25,271
Come on.

692
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,571
Matt?

693
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,491
Thanks for the coffee.

694
00:43:58,137 --> 00:43:59,305
Clear.

695
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,190
You live alone?

696
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,359
You wanna ask me out, or you wanna wait outside?

697
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:45,100
Officers?

698
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,688
Hello?

699
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,213
Hands on your head, Frank.

700
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,841
I mean it.

701
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:18,967
It wasn't me.

702
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,596
Hands on your head or I will
unload this thing, I swear to Christ!

703
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:24,973
It wasn't me.

704
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,059
Do it.

705
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:30,937
Okay. Okay.

706
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,231
Hey.

707
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:56,171
Jesus Christ!

708
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,089
You believe me now?

709
00:45:58,173 --> 00:45:59,508
I believe you.
I believe you.

710
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:00,717
Okay.

711
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,928
You gotta get out of here.

712
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,305
Stay low.

713
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:06,056
Go, stay low.

714
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:44,595
Miguel?

715
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:46,930
Yes, Mr. Fisk?

716
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,142
I'd like you to call Mr. Donovan.

717
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:54,521
I'd like to reexamine Matthew Murdock's files.

718
00:46:54,605 --> 00:46:55,897
Yes, sir.

719
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,315
Listen to me, asshole.

720
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:24,611
I don't care what the Hand wants,
with me or anyone else.

721
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:26,697
This is not my war.

722
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,533
The Hand didn't send me.

723
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:33,036
Stick did.

724
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:03,609
Great. Now what?

725
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,102
Hey. What are you--

726
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,653
Oh, my God.
What did you--
