1
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,691
There.

2
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:24,150
It just hit.

3
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,530
It's gotta be 40 stories, at least.

4
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,658
Down!

5
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:37,496
They're on all sides.
Half a dozen, at least.

6
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:39,373
- I got a problem.
- Right with you.

7
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,125
No, you don't get it.
I can't get a read on these guys.

8
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,794
There's no sound, there's no heartbeat,
there's nothing.

9
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,629
- They're trained to hide themselves.
- How do you know?

10
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:46,715
Don't focus on the fighters, track their weapons.

11
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:48,798
- They have swords.
- They have swords, I can hear.

12
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,598
Elektra, no!

13
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,532
Matthew...

14
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,276
So...

15
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,574
who wants to get the hell out of here?

16
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,856
She's losing too much blood.

17
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:50,982
Hell of a scrape.

18
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,441
Where are you taking her?

19
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:55,779
They're still coming.
Fast little shits.

20
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:59,365
- Who are they, Stick?
- Bad time to chat.

21
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:33,691
- Matty!
- On it!

22
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:39,447
- Watch your ass.
- Yeah.

23
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,287
No, no, no.
No, she's dying.

24
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,581
- Stick, she's dying.
- Not if I can stop it.

25
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,833
We need to get her to a hospital.

26
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,501
Doctors can't help her.
I can.

27
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,587
We're going to your place.
It's her only shot.

28
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,673
Sweetie, stay with me.
Stay with me.

29
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,300
Second wave.
Brace her.

30
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,067
End of that batch.

31
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,487
There'll be more.

32
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,866
Always more.

33
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,005
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is bad.

34
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:39,090
What's happening to her?

35
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,841
You got baking soda?

36
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,385
Yeah, in the fridge, why?

37
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,721
To neutralize the acid in the toilet bowl cleaner.

38
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,474
Plus whiskey, pliers, black tea.

39
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,601
Tell me what's going on, Stick.

40
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,770
Do you wanna talk or save your girlfriend?

41
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,485
Her heart's skipping.

42
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,905
Whiskey.

43
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,659
The toxins in her bloodstream
are shutting everything down.

44
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:07,785
Is she gonna live?

45
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,245
Baking soda?

46
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,665
I thought you got it.

47
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,795
Matthew!

48
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,339
I need pliers and hot tea.

49
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,053
The pliers are behind you.

50
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,650
Matthew...

51
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,569
I'm here.
I'm here.

52
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,948
If I die...

53
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:48,201
No, you're not gonna die.
You hear me?

54
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:49,994
Elektra, look at me.

55
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:52,371
Hey, hey, focus on me.

56
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,623
Breathe. Breathe.

57
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,292
That's good. That's good.

58
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,710
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,046
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

60
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,297
Bring her in here!

61
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,631
Yeah.

62
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,179
One, two, three.

63
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,108
- Clean sheets.
- Yeah.

64
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,405
Can you save her?

65
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,324
Not before I make her worse.

66
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,410
Oh, Jesus!
Stick, take it easy!

67
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,496
Those blades were poisoned.

68
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,039
She'll be dead in 20 minutes

69
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:37,833
if I don't pull some serious juju out of my ass.

70
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,710
Make the goddamn tea!

71
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:44,715
Easy.

72
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,063
Easy. Easy, young lady.
I'm right here.

73
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,086
...forgive those who trespass against us.

74
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:12,910
Matty, use that hearing of yours.

75
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,704
How's her heart rate?

76
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:23,254
Yeah. Yeah, it's good.
It's steady.

77
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,590
Sheets.

78
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,683
Not too neat...

79
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,769
but...

80
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,563
it'll do.

81
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,730
Tea?

82
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,988
Thank you.

83
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,034
Ah...

84
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,442
She'll recover?

85
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,986
Twenty-four hours will tell.

86
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,905
I've known her to pull through worse.

87
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,284
What'd you just say?

88
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:38,537
Ellie's a real fighter.
Always has been.

89
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,375
You... You know her?

90
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,293
I didn't mention that?

91
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,505
What the hell's going on?
How do you know Elektra?

92
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,590
- I'm not done in there.
- I want some answers!

93
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,758
Everybody wants something.

94
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,969
- Do you want me to throw you out?
- Not unless you want her to die.

95
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,020
Sit down, Matty.

96
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,774
Where is he?

97
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,112
Um, I may have told him just to stay home today.

98
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,655
You what?

99
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,448
He wasn't actually supposed to do it.

100
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,285
Whoa, whoa, Foggy, what the hell happened yesterday?

101
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,702
I can't do this alone.

102
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,413
I didn't even wanna take this case.

103
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:23,582
- It'll be okay, I--
- The whole city is watching.

104
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,958
If I screw up, I'd never work again.

105
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,795
And, frankly, you'd probably never work
again, either, by association, which--

106
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,673
Stop, Foggy. Stop thinking
about screwing up, about losing.

107
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,133
You need to think about winning.

108
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,845
Colonel Ray Schoonover, United States Marine Corps.

109
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,556
Do you swear to tell the truth,

110
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,809
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

111
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,477
I do.

112
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,816
You got this.

113
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,484
Counsel?

114
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,661
Colonel, how long have you known the defendant?

115
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,080
I'd say, the better part of a decade.

116
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:04,832
Most of his career in the Marine Corps.

117
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,710
So you're familiar with his service
in the Middle East?

118
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,545
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran?

119
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,672
Yes, very familiar.

120
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,007
I wonder if you could tell us

121
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,927
how Lieutenant Frank Castle won the Navy Cross?

122
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,348
Due to the nature of that mission,
you'll have to understand that

123
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,600
the precise circumstances are classified.

124
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,605
Um...

125
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,817
How about the part that's not?

126
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,153
Lieutenant Frank Castle was part of a small team.

127
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:37,323
He was conducting a close target reconnaissance

128
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,450
in the vicinity of the Hindu Kush.

129
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:43,704
The mission became compromised,
taking enemy contact on three sides.

130
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,083
Lieutenant Castle wanted to abort.

131
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,087
Said the mission was a bust,
pulling the plug would save lives.

132
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,007
- Officer in charge said "no."
- And why was that?

133
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,175
Maybe he wanted more medals on his chest.

134
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,428
Doesn't matter.
Either way, Frank was right.

135
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:02,890
They were cut off, boxed into a canyon.

136
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,933
And what happened next?

137
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,811
Within the first hour,
the officer in charge of that mission

138
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,855
got his arm blown off.

139
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,190
So Lieutenant Castle assumed command.

140
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:15,319
His only goal was to get his men out alive.

141
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:18,531
The enemy had set up an ambush

142
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,950
at the only LZ that would accommodate
one of our birds.

143
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,035
Sorry, Colonel?

144
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:27,456
LZ is a landing zone
that can accommodate a helicopter.

145
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,294
So the enemy, they block this landing zone,

146
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,797
knowing it was the only shot
the team had to get out alive.

147
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,715
All they had to do was wait.

148
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,926
They knew that Frank's team had to come to them.

149
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,052
Fish in a barrel.

150
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,387
So to speak.

151
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,431
Only fish don't know they're gonna die.

152
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,891
These men did.

153
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:51,647
Frank went to the LZ all by himself
to draw the bastards away.

154
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,691
Why didn't he order one of his men to do it?

155
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:54,775
He certainly could have.

156
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,777
Not his style.

157
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,783
So the men hear the fire fight break out.
All hell breaks loose.

158
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,868
Frank against God knows how many.

159
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,120
And then there was silence.

160
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:11,500
The team thinks, "That's it.
Frank's dead, and we're next."

161
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:16,880
Next sound they hear is the helos, the helicopters.

162
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,800
They get to the landing zone, you know what they see?

163
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,387
Frank Castle, standing there, grinning.

164
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:27,099
Thirty-two muj surrounding him, all dead.

165
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,644
Son of a gun cleared that entire LZ all by himself.

166
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:32,480
How?

167
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,483
By being Frank Castle.

168
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,485
- And his men survived?
- All of 'em.

169
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,446
Including the idiot officer
that got 'em trapped in the first place.

170
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,699
If you had to sum up Frank Castle,
how would you do it?

171
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,701
I would say Frank Castle is a man

172
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:49,037
who would gladly give his life to keep others safe.

173
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,248
And the crimes he's accused of today?

174
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,125
Could the man you knew have committed them?

175
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,752
Absolutely not.

176
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,715
Lieutenant Frank Castle that I know is a hero.

177
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,634
A man who deserves our respect...

178
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,177
and our gratitude.

179
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,139
Not the same man.

180
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,643
Thank you, sir.
No more questions, Your Honor.

181
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,021
People?

182
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:26,241
I'd like to personally thank you
for your service to this country, Colonel.

183
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,744
My father served in Vietnam.

184
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,622
- Do you know what he told me about medals?
- No, ma'am.

185
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,708
He said the only people who truly know what happened

186
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,084
are the ones that were there.

187
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,004
You told a nice story, Colonel...

188
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:43,634
but how can we know that it happened
the way you described?

189
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,262
Well, perhaps I wasn't clear.
I was there, ma'am.

190
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,642
That officer that didn't listen to Frank,
got his men trapped...

191
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,310
you're looking at him.

192
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:54,895
And believe me when I tell you,

193
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,399
I thank God every day that I only lost my arm.

194
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,528
That man saved my life, the lives of his entire team.

195
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,030
If it was up to me,

196
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,741
he'd have a Medal of Honor hanging around his neck.

197
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,746
No further questions at this time, Your Honor.

198
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,834
How'd you miss that in his file?

199
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,251
All the names were redacted.

200
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,377
Not good.

201
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,879
No shit.

202
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,549
Hey, Matt couldn't have done it better.

203
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,468
It was good.

204
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,310
How is she?

205
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,396
Well... she'll live.

206
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:40,858
Yeah? You sure?

207
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,610
Sure as I am of anything.

208
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,743
Jesus, didn't we do this already?

209
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,119
Start talking, Stick.

210
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,079
It's about the war.

211
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,789
What is?

212
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,165
All of it.

213
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,211
Roxxon, Midland Circle, the damn hole, Elektra--

214
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,256
All right, you've been using this war
as an excuse since the day I met you,

215
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,842
and you still haven't told me
a goddamn thing about it.

216
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,511
- You know what I think?
- Tell me.

217
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,345
I think you're full of shit.

218
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,014
I don't think there is any war.

219
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,433
I think you're just a sick old fighter
dying to hit people,

220
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:17,438
so you make up stories to justify your behavior.

221
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:22,065
And then, you rope in the wounded...

222
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,110
so that you can sit back and watch them
throw away their lives,

223
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,570
and you can feel important.

224
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:27,821
Sit down.

225
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,034
Sit down, Matty.

226
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,584
It all began centuries ago.

227
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,169
Nobody knows how many,

228
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,004
but the shit we're dipping into...

229
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,298
is ancient.

230
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:52,429
Back then, warlords and their gangs
ruled the countryside.

231
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,848
Not that much different from today.

232
00:16:55,766 --> 00:17:01,647
Bloodthirsty, greedy brutes after loot,
pussy, booze, same ol', same ol'.

233
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,067
But... one day,

234
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,236
one of these collections of assholes

235
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,115
comes across a thing they can barely understand.

236
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,367
Real treasure.

237
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,120
Not gold, or rubies, or any of that.

238
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,959
They found the secret.

239
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,294
What secret?

240
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,671
Immortality.

241
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,882
Bringing the dead back to life.

242
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,134
Come on, Stick.

243
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:35,305
I thought you were a Catholic, Matty.

244
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:40,936
Doesn't your whole belief system
hinge on one guy pulling that off?

245
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,024
So...

246
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:50,153
Free from the fear of death,

247
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:55,743
these pieces of shit step up,
kill their master, take over,

248
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,911
and paint the shores of the Far East

249
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,998
with the blood of anybody who stands in their way.

250
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,754
They grow in size, power, wealth...

251
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,340
spread across Asia...

252
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,010
and finally give themselves a name.

253
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,387
Yaminote.

254
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,515
It means, "The Hand."

255
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,394
And did they have a goal?

256
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:26,023
Weapons.
It's always weapons.

257
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,441
Like, guns, bombs?

258
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,693
Worse.

259
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,821
Thing called a Black Sky.

260
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,241
So, what's it do, this, uh, Black Sky?

261
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,118
Nobody knows exactly.

262
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,579
Why not?

263
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:44,625
Because they've never activated one.

264
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,378
They've tried.
They'll try again.

265
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,173
But...

266
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,385
the Hand made one mistake.

267
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,179
They made enemies.

268
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,430
Bingo.

269
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,475
Some say it was just a kid.

270
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:08,315
Hand comes into his village, kills everyone...

271
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,067
almost.

272
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:16,489
Kid... pulls the knife from the breast
of his dead mother...

273
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,242
...and goes to work.

274
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:24,039
He cuts down some of the Hand's finest warriors.

275
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,586
They're lying dead... kid's standing.

276
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,507
They give him a name.
The Chaste.

277
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,260
And he's just one kid?
Alone?

278
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:41,223
Kid grows up, rounds up every warrior he can.

279
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:46,436
Men, women, young, old,
doesn't matter as long as they kick ass.

280
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,938
And they do.

281
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,232
Without mercy.

282
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,197
And the only protection this world
has against the Hand.

283
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,159
Wow.

284
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,956
Now, in this fairy tale...

285
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,168
you're the Chaste, right? That's...

286
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,879
Is that it?

287
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,091
It's why I didn't tell you.

288
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,886
No, no, it's... It's good.
It leaves you front and center.

289
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,389
Finding the Hand, keeping the Black Skies at bay.

290
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,557
Murdering when it suits you.

291
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,519
Believe it or don't.

292
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,775
The fact remains that the city
you're sworn to protect

293
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:36,486
is ground zero in a war
it doesn't even know is happening.

294
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,696
That hole is just the start.

295
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,451
So, you can kill, die,

296
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:47,831
or sit on your ass and watch Hell's Kitchen burn...

297
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:55,005
but this war is bigger than you,
or me, or any of our...

298
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,092
problems.

299
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,763
And you've pulled Elektra to your side, haven't you?

300
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,890
Welcome to the world, kid.

301
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,729
Elektra works for me.

302
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,198
The bullet penetrated Mr. Castle's skull

303
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,449
in the lower right quadrant,

304
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,452
or more specifically, the sphenofrontal suture,

305
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:29,081
which is the cranial suture between
the sphenoid bone and the frontal bones,

306
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,415
both here and here.

307
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,669
I believe what my expert witness is trying to convey

308
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,589
is that my client, Frank Castle, was shot...

309
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,758
point blank, execution style, in the head.

310
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:46,764
Could you please describe the damage
Mr. Castle sustained from the bullet?

311
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,809
It fragmented on impact, causing damage

312
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,769
in both the right frontal lobe
and temporal lobe of his brain.

313
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:54,231
What are the effects of such an injury?

314
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,775
Mr. Castle is suffering from
what we call sympathetic storming.

315
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,362
It's a heightened and ongoing
state of fight or flight,

316
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,656
in which the sympathetic nervous system
is hyperactive.

317
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,452
As if he is reliving the incident
of trauma over and over again.

318
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,956
It can plunge a seemingly peaceful individual into...

319
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,125
mental and emotional chaos.

320
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,585
It sure sounds a lot like PTSD.

321
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,212
No, that's not where we're going.

322
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,796
Just... listen.

323
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,757
Could you define it for the jury, please?

324
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,093
Extreme emotional disturbance.

325
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,761
It's twofold.

326
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,181
First, the defendant is so emotionally
disturbed that he loses control.

327
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,434
And second, the defendant
has a reasonable explanation

328
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,520
for said disturbance, from his point of view.

329
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:37,565
Are you aware that Frank Castle's
wife, son, and daughter

330
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,567
were all murdered right in front of him

331
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,736
when he sustained the brain injury in question?

332
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,196
An injury which, you say,

333
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,909
keeps him in a perpetual state
of mental and emotional chaos?

334
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:47,993
I am, yes.

335
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,121
With that in mind, would you say that
Frank Castle's mental state

336
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:55,542
satisfies the definition of
"extreme emotional disturbance"?

337
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,794
Objection, calls for a conclusion.

338
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,297
Your Honor, Dr. Lee is an expert on the brain.

339
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,340
He is qualified to an opinion,

340
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:06,511
and said opinion is not only relevant,
but imperative to the case.

341
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,182
Overruled.

342
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,391
Dr. Lee?

343
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,811
Personally, I do believe
he is suffering from EED, yes.

344
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:18,523
And one who's suffering from
extreme emotional disturbance,

345
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:22,652
is it possible to willfully premeditate a crime?

346
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,488
Any infractions would be considered
crimes of passion.

347
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,325
How many of your other patients

348
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,828
witnessed their families being
brutally murdered right in front of them?

349
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,746
Other than Frank Castle?

350
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,082
He's the only one.

351
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,668
And so would you say the circumstances
surrounding Frank's mental state

352
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,296
is different than those of your other patients?

353
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,630
I would.

354
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:47,219
And what exactly would that difference be,
in simple terms?

355
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,387
Frank Castle's been through hell.

356
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,431
Thank you.

357
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,975
You killed my dad!

358
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,517
I don't give a shit what you've been through!

359
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,401
- Order! Order in the court!
- You killed him!

360
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,064
- I saw him in his coffin...
- Please remove that young man now.

361
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,399
He was my dad, and now he's gone!

362
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:06,863
I'm now instructing each and every
one of you to disregard that outburst

363
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,408
and to not let it influence
your opinions on this case.

364
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,162
I did that.

365
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:16,373
Right?

366
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,128
That kid, I took his father from him.
I did that.

367
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,547
- Yeah, you did.
- Uh-huh.

368
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,178
Look, Frank, I can't judge you.

369
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,352
That was tough in there for you, right?
It was...

370
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,062
It was, um, hard?

371
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,276
Yeah.

372
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,696
Okay.

373
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,199
You gotta do something for me.

374
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,950
Hmm?

375
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:55,078
I need you to take the stand.

376
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,579
Come on, for what?
Why would I...

377
00:24:56,663 --> 00:25:00,083
The jury has to know what happened to you,
what you go through every single day.

378
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,669
After this afternoon...

379
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,172
I don't think we have any other shot.

380
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,631
What?

381
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,675
And what do you think is gonna happen here?

382
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,759
We're not gonna win this thing.

383
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,803
No, but we can still reduce the charges.

384
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,558
Look, that might not be important to you,
but it is important to me.

385
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:20,103
All of them, they all think that you're a monster.

386
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,272
But I know that you're not.
You're not!

387
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,901
You sure about that?

388
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,655
What if I find these men that did that to my family?

389
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,739
What if...

390
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:36,035
What if nothing changes?

391
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,083
What if this is just me now?

392
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,756
Then don't you deserve to know that, too?

393
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,639
Foggy!

394
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:57,807
Hey.

395
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,936
He'll do it.
He'll take the stand.

396
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,771
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

397
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:06,483
Look, unless you have a better idea, I think--

398
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,485
How did we even get here?

399
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,320
This guy's a murderer.

400
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,281
He's killed fathers and brothers.
You heard that kid.

401
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,824
Why are we helping him?

402
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:21,539
Do you think that Frank is completely
and totally mentally healthy?

403
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,000
- I think he's batshit.
- Yeah?

404
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,169
Well, then that's why you help him.

405
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,214
Put him on the stand, Foggy.

406
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,882
Shit.
Okay.

407
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,551
- One caveat, though.
- Okay.

408
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,887
- We get Matt to do the questioning.
- No.

409
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,722
- Yes.
- No.

410
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,767
You're doing great, okay?
You're making Reyes play defense.

411
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,851
You... you don't need Matt for this.

412
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,728
- I do, Karen!
- Why do you always do this?

413
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,481
Why do you put Matt in the driver's seat
when you can do this yourself?

414
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,316
Matt and I are partners for a reason.

415
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,611
There's some things that I'm better at,
and there's things that he's better at.

416
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,112
This is something that he'll be better at.

417
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,697
He's barely spent two seconds with Frank.

418
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:57,492
I know, but that kid nearly destroyed us in there.

419
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,995
And at this moment, Matt is the right
person to question Frank.

420
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,455
He just is.

421
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,251
Okay.

422
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,335
I'll get him.

423
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:32,319
- I'm sorry--
- When we met...

424
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,198
was it fate?

425
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:38,866
Was it luck?

426
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,079
Or was I a mission?

427
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,878
Mission.

428
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:14,277
Stick trained me a long time, like he trained you.

429
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,614
He's not a sentimental man, but he wanted you back.

430
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,786
He wanted you to forget about law, your friends...

431
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:25,747
your city.

432
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,251
He thought I could distract you.

433
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,629
He was right.

434
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:33,755
No.

435
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,134
Because I did the thing I promised him I'd never do.

436
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,596
I fell in love with you, Matthew.

437
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:45,016
Listen to my heartbeat, if you must.

438
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,934
You know it's true.

439
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:53,441
Stick told me about some
secret Japanese organization.

440
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,652
The Hand.

441
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,696
They won't stop until
they've infiltrated your whole city.

442
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,824
Killed every last member of the Chaste.

443
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,951
- Stick--
- You.

444
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,120
We live on the front lines.

445
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,456
Like it or not.

446
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,583
It doesn't mean we have to fight Stick's way.

447
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,545
He kills his enemies, and we don't have to.

448
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,630
You make that choice sound so easy.

449
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:18,508
No, it's not easy.
It's impossible.

450
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:23,388
But it's a choice and it's a choice
that I remake every single day.

451
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:26,015
Every second, sometimes.

452
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,934
And you can, too.

453
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,353
Matthew, there are things about me you don't know.

454
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:31,729
- I don't need to know.
- I want you to.

455
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,023
I don't care, whatever you've done in the past...

456
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,693
Elektra, whoever you've chosen to be,
you're free now, all right?

457
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,945
You could have killed those men
at the hole, but you didn't.

458
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,280
Because you're not Stick.

459
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:43,783
And screw him for ever making you
feel like you might be, even for a second.

460
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:45,242
- He can hear you.
- I don't care.

461
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,954
When you were hurt,
when I thought I might lose you, I...

462
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,291
I...

463
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,335
I felt hollow.

464
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,546
Now, I have no reason to trust you.

465
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:59,256
You've lied to me more times than I can count.

466
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,343
But if you leave Stick...

467
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:04,304
be with me.

468
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,640
Fight this war by my side.

469
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:08,933
My way.

470
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,395
Our way.

471
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,232
Why are you so good?

472
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,696
I'm not.

473
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,866
Yes.

474
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,329
There's a light inside you.

475
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,502
I tried to snuff it out in college.

476
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,631
I'm so lucky I failed.

477
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,514
Someone... someone's here.

478
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,141
You got company.

479
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:52,852
Hey.

480
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:56,731
Karen...

481
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,191
Hi.

482
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,404
Um, let's, uh...

483
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:03,738
- let's go somewhere.
- No. Why?

484
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,407
- So we can talk.
- I don't want to.

485
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,074
I know this looks crazy, but it's really not.

486
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,993
It doesn't...
It doesn't matter.

487
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:12,622
Frank Castle's going to take the stand tomorrow.

488
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,499
And your friend could use your help.

489
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,584
That's all.

490
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,422
Nice meetin' ya.

491
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:34,018
Fan club's here.

492
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:37,104
Word must have gotten out about Frank testifying.

493
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:39,524
Matt better show.

494
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:43,027
If he doesn't, we'll survive.
Right?

495
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,836
Karen, I'm so sorry about--

496
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,464
Uh, Foggy wants to walk through some things with you.

497
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,680
Yeah, you wanted me here?

498
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,806
Wow.

499
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,182
Let's be clear.

500
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,562
You're not here because
you're a better lawyer or person.

501
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:21,190
You're here because you're almost as crazy
as Frank Castle, and that's it.

502
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,109
So you called me here to insult me?

503
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:25,987
I called you here to be useful, for a change.

504
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,573
We need to get Frank to tell his story
in a way that keeps him

505
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,700
out of prison and alive.

506
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:35,121
No one's heard that story except for you,
because you're who you are.

507
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,957
Why don't you put all that torture
you put me and Karen through to good use?

508
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,751
Now would be the time.

509
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,168
Counsel, we about ready?

510
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:42,879
Uh, one more moment, Your Honor.

511
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,549
Did you read the notes from Schoonover and Lee?

512
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:47,634
Yeah.

513
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,051
Okay, here's the play.

514
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,386
Walk Frank through his story.

515
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,097
Connect the dots between the Colonel
and the neurologist.

516
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,767
We don't have to prove
that Frank's version of events is true.

517
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,310
We just have to convince the jury
that he believes it,

518
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,687
and he relives it every day.

519
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:02,273
We can put this guy in the loony bin,
where he belongs.

520
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:03,775
- Counsel?
- Yeah.

521
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:07,028
Uh, Your Honor, the Defense would like
to call Frank Castle to the stand.

522
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,864
Bailiff, bring in the defendant, please.

523
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,541
Tell me what's going on.

524
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:22,293
Frank's wearing a suit.

525
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,505
He looks better than I ever have,
and he's not even wearing a tie.

526
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,889
Order.

527
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,355
Think about what you want, Frank.

528
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,032
- Something's not right.
- No turning back now.

529
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,661
Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth,

530
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,245
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

531
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,789
so help you God?

532
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:01,874
Yeah.

533
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,003
Please state your name for the record.

534
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,547
Frank Castle.

535
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:24,355
Mr. Castle, you've been charged
with multiple capital crimes.

536
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:28,818
Been called a killer incapable of empathy or remorse.

537
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,444
Hmm.

538
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,113
Yeah.

539
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:33,280
So I hear.

540
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,324
Frank...

541
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,034
May I call you Frank?

542
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:42,874
Yeah.

543
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:46,460
Frank, we've heard a lot about neuro-chemistry...

544
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,671
and psychology, and all things unfolding,

545
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:51,257
scientifically and otherwise, inside your brain.

546
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:54,719
But I just have one question I want to ask.

547
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:58,723
What happened that day?

548
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,558
The day your family was so tragically killed.

549
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,612
It's okay, Frank.

550
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,572
- I understand, it's difficult.
- Do you?

551
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:18,743
Do you understand?

552
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:23,039
'Cause I don't think you understand shit.

553
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,841
I'd like permission to treat the witness
as hostile, Your Honor?

554
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:34,967
Granted.

555
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,094
All right, Frank.

556
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,931
You don't want to tell us?
I'll tell you.

557
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,474
I'm gonna tell you exactly what kind of man you are.

558
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,020
You're the kind of man this city needs.

559
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,732
Because, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
we all know this city needs help.

560
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,358
Needs it now.

561
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:53,778
Not tomorrow, not next week, not when the day comes,

562
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:57,073
when the corruption that Wilson Fisk
left in his wake is flushed out for good,

563
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:59,450
and the police force is finally back on its feet.

564
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,202
We need it now.

565
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,705
'Cause this city's been sick.

566
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:06,999
And the cops, they can't fix it alone, they need...

567
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:11,087
We all need men and women who are
willing to take the fight themselves.

568
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,255
The kind of people who risk their lives

569
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,842
so that we can walk safe at night
in our own neighborhoods.

570
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:19,595
The ones our esteemed District Attorney
here is trying so hard to destroy.

571
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,764
New York needs these people.

572
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:24,684
We need... heroes.

573
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,478
Order.

574
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,565
The help they offer...

575
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,360
...and the hope that they provide.

576
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:39,907
Frank Castle wanted to help, but he took it too far.

577
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:42,159
He shot people, he killed people.

578
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,535
It's against the law.

579
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,622
And he broke that law many, many times.

580
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,582
Now, I don't like him any more than you do,

581
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,877
but here's the thing, he's not a common criminal.

582
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,045
He's not malicious in intent.

583
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:55,631
Frank Castle is actually a good man.
He just...

584
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:58,134
He doesn't know the difference
between right and wrong anymore.

585
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:00,011
And he doesn't need punishment for that.

586
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,262
He needs help.

587
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,638
Our help.

588
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,894
That's the kind of man Frank Castle is.

589
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:13,107
And now, you have to decide
what kind of jury you want to be.

590
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:17,194
No further questions, Your Honor.

591
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,281
Your, uh...

592
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,366
Your Honor?

593
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,786
Can I say something?

594
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:27,204
You may.

595
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,081
You know those, uh...

596
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:32,376
Those people?

597
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,088
The ones I put down, the people I killed?

598
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,383
I want you to know that I'd do it all again.

599
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,718
This is a circus, all right?

600
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:43,637
It's a charade, it's an act.

601
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,306
- It's bullshit about how crazy I am.
- Language.

602
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,058
I ain't crazy!

603
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:48,684
I'm not crazy.

604
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:49,769
Okay?

605
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,438
I know what I did.

606
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:56,150
I know who I am.

607
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,360
And I do not need your help.

608
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:04,826
I'm smack-dab in the middle of my right goddamn mind,

609
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,493
and any scumbag, any...

610
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:10,747
any lowlife, any maggot piece of shit
that I put down, I did it...

611
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,541
- because I liked it!
- Order!

612
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,669
Hell, I loved it! I'm sittin' here, I'm...
I'm just itching.

613
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,130
I'm itching to do it again.

614
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:21,425
And you think... What, you think
you're gonna send me to a nuthouse?

615
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,470
Some doctor, they're gonna get me to stop
from doing what I want to do?

616
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,806
Well, that ain't happening!
Not on my watch!

617
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,184
You people, you call me the Punisher,
ain't that right?

618
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,435
The big bad Punisher.

619
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,854
- Bailiff.
- Well, here I am!

620
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,605
- Remove the witness.
- You want it, you got it!

621
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,024
I am the Punisher!
I'm right here!

622
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:39,026
You want it, I'll give it to you.

623
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,905
And anybody who came here today
to hear me whine, to hear me beg?

624
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:45,032
Well, you can kiss my ass!

625
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,493
Do you hear me? I'm guilty.

626
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:50,246
Come on, please, Judge!
I'm guilty, you hear me?

627
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,331
I'm guilty! I'm guilty!

628
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,376
I'll kill every one of 'em!
I'll kill every single one!

629
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:58,754
How the hell did this happen?

630
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:00,131
That wasn't the Frank I met with yesterday.

631
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:01,590
Guys...

632
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,385
- I think somebody got to him.
- Convincing him of what?

633
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,720
Yelling his way to multiple life sentences?

634
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,722
- You provoked him.
- What? I didn't...

635
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,805
- What are you talking--
- I had it lined up for you.

636
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,851
We could have done this.

637
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,769
We could have gotten the charges reduced.

638
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,105
All you had to do was get Frank to tell his story.

639
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:19,148
- Instead you veer off into vigilante-land!
- Foggy, he wasn't cooperating!

640
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:20,567
I'm glad we lost.

641
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:22,278
You hear me? I'm glad.

642
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,820
- Foggy...
- Karen, let him go.

643
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:24,906
I don't want to hear it.

644
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,323
Karen, can I talk to you for five seconds, please?

645
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,492
I don't want to hear another bullshit excuse!

646
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,163
Maybe you are an alcoholic.
Maybe you're in a fight club.

647
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:34,540
Maybe you are sleeping with a whole harem of women.

648
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:36,042
I don't care, I'm done.

649
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,712
You're right.

650
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:43,049
This city really needs heroes.

651
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,302
But you're not one of them.

652
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,730
You gotta feel like shit.

653
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,358
Go back to bed.

654
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,821
I can barely stand.

655
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,033
Then go back to bed.

656
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,540
No.

657
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,339
I don't want to be with you anymore.

658
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,300
I want to be with him.

659
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:29,386
- Don't be stupid.
- He needs more training.

660
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,887
The Hand is new to him--

661
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:32,723
Soft.

662
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,725
Matt Murdock is soft.

663
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,310
He made you soft.

664
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:39,230
You let your guard down.

665
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,983
Go back to bed, Ellie.

666
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:44,693
- I'm not a child.
- You can't be with him.

667
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,861
Why?

668
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,241
You can't change what you are.

669
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:52,909
Matthew thinks I can.

670
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:55,454
And I believe him.

671
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,793
Get out...

672
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:04,463
before I get nasty.

673
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,257
Are you threatening me?

674
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,425
You're damn right, I am.

675
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:13,805
Go.

676
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,314
What do you think he'll say...

677
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,901
when he finds out...

678
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,403
what you are?

679
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,697
What you've always been?

680
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,951
Haven't told him yet...

681
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:36,662
have ya?

682
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,500
Get out.

683
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,211
Aside from saving your ass...

684
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:51,510
you have no idea what I've protected you from.

685
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,387
I can protect myself.

686
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:00,936
We'll find out.

687
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:23,542
Enough with these amateurs.
Time to get the band back together.

688
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,086
Head to the Wall.

689
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:44,790
Where's Stick?

690
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,253
I made my choice.

691
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:52,256
He didn't like it.

692
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:57,761
I want to be with you.

693
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,933
The only person in this world who believes I'm good.

694
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:25,121
You lost today.

695
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,542
It doesn't matter.

696
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,672
You lost more than just the case.

697
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,760
Yeah.

698
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,429
I didn't lose you.

699
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,061
I'm sorry.

700
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,022
I'm not.

701
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,659
How does this work?

702
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:05,704
You and me?

703
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,917
How can we make it work?

704
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,420
I don't know.

705
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,591
But we're gonna figure it out.

706
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,929
Not now, though.

707
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,686
Right now, you need to rest.

708
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:06,259
Who do you work for? Huh?

709
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,470
Who sent you?

710
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:10,722
Answer me! Huh?

711
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,267
You tell them, whoever they are,

712
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,188
I'm gonna find them, and when I do, I'm gonna--

713
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,070
No...

714
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:27,823
You're... You're just a kid.

715
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,410
Elektra, no...
No...

716
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:53,098
What did you do?

717
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:09,531
This is who I am.

718
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:17,330
Do you still want me?

719
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,004
Matthew.

720
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,339
Matthew!

721
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,971
You're okay...
You're okay...

722
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:46,735
I got this one.

723
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,028
On whose orders?

724
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,822
The warden's.
You got a problem with that?

725
00:49:50,906 --> 00:49:53,033
No one tells us anything down here.

726
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,599
Hey, look at me, Frank!
Look at me!

727
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:19,100
I'm gonna stick you!

728
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:21,477
That's a promise!

729
00:50:21,562 --> 00:50:23,229
I promise you!

730
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:51,234
Right through here.

731
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:43,411
I see you got my message.
