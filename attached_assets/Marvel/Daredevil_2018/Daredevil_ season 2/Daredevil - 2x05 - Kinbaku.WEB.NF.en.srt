1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,412
Oh, it tastes like fish eggs.

2
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,083
I think they are, Einstein.

3
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,335
And it tops out at $200 an ounce.

4
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,629
You two really think you can crash this party?

5
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:47,381
- Yes.
- We're kind of ambitious.

6
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:49,843
- Are you gonna kick us out, bro?
- Depends.

7
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,095
Are you pompous jackasses?

8
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,180
Uh, well, we're not... pompous.

9
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,932
Help yourself.

10
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,352
Mmm, the taste kind of grows on you.

11
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,606
You wanna get down on this?
Pull up a stool.

12
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,608
Uh, you do that.
I'm gonna find the alcohol.

13
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,276
Genius! And grab me a beer!

14
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,115
It's not a cabin cruiser, it's a yacht.

15
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,200
For the $24,000 we're paying Dalton,

16
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,745
I would expect Jackson's modern dance to be included.

17
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,830
I like the way the Jets are playing this year.

18
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,164
- Excuse me.
- It's time to go.

19
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,249
- No, I'm just looking for--
- You found it.

20
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,876
Come on.

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,094
He's with me.

22
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:17,806
Excuse me.

23
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,594
Mmm! German beer.
Tastes like piss.

24
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:42,724
What the hell are you doing here?

25
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,851
You've never been hard to find.

26
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:46,978
That's not what I asked.

27
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,856
At least your furniture's improved.

28
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,151
Kinda liked my old futon.

29
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,820
I liked breaking it in.

30
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,822
Nice place.

31
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:00,283
Too bad about the clothes, though.

32
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,575
Why are you here?

33
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,790
Would you believe it if I said I missed you?

34
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,582
- No.
- Smart man.

35
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,085
Columbia education really paid off.

36
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:14,005
No thanks to you.

37
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:17,091
I'm in New York for a meeting.
I thought I'd pop by.

38
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,552
Well, you're not staying here, so...

39
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:20,970
Fine.

40
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:24,390
My penthouse in midtown will just have to do, then.

41
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,683
We spent some nights there.

42
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,476
Look, if you came here to walk down memory lane,

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,120
- I don't really have the--
- I'm sorry.

44
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:35,484
I've spent years trying to convince myself
that things happen for a reason,

45
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:38,279
that you and I were not meant to be.

46
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:44,618
But I know now.
That wasn't fate.

47
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,788
It was a choice.

48
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:49,707
My choice.

49
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:52,919
And I'm sorry.

50
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,050
I'm alone in the world, Matthew.

51
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,345
Do you know what that feels like?

52
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,516
Of course you do.

53
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:12,814
And you know what it's like
to clean up your father's messes.

54
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,151
A long time ago, before he died,

55
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:20,196
my father did business with the Roxxon Corporation.

56
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,280
Roxxon?

57
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,242
Energy, cleaning supplies, macaroni and cheese.

58
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,744
Child labor, slave trade.

59
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,371
They have their fingers in everything.

60
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,789
I believe it's called diversification.

61
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:33,251
And thanks to my father's shitty investments,

62
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,627
they hold most of his wealth.

63
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,753
Yeah, okay, I...

64
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:40,674
I have a meeting tomorrow with the board
at the Yakatomi Building.

65
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,636
And I need your help, Matthew.

66
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,763
How am I supposed to help you?

67
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,516
I want you to use that expensive
legal training of yours

68
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,060
- to help me get my money back.
- See, I'm a defense lawyer.

69
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:53,938
- I'll pay you well.
- I'm not taking your money.

70
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,815
And, even if I accepted, there's not enough time.

71
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,110
- For what?
- Oh, just research.

72
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,404
Accounts, shareholders, hierarchy of the--

73
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,532
- You have 15 hours.
- Fifteen hours, Elektra, are you insane?

74
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:05,866
Matthew.

75
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,664
You're the only person I can trust.

76
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,876
Well, sweetheart, you don't break into
my house and then talk to me about trust.

77
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,795
Don't overthink it.

78
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,214
It's just a bunch of guys in business suits.

79
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,341
They won't know what hit them.

80
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,760
Would be fun, like old times.

81
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,972
Oh, you and I, we have very different ideas of fun.

82
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,432
You can say whatever you want.

83
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,018
- But I know you--
- No, you don't.

84
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,227
You don't, not anymore.

85
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,940
Not... ever again.

86
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:43,904
Well...

87
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,781
that's disappointing.

88
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,535
Get out.

89
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,471
Morning.

90
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,432
We, uh, have anything for breakfast?

91
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,850
You hungry or hungover?

92
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:16,770
Both.

93
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,858
All right, you need some potassium,
some electrolytes, and a jolt of caffeine.

94
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:23,027
I'll give you, uh...

95
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:28,241
The last piece of Mrs. DiNizio's peach cobbler,

96
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:31,077
which is the last piece of anything in this office.

97
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,912
I guess our finances
haven't improved since last week.

98
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:37,333
Yeah, well, clients don't respond well
to a "closed" sign.

99
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,586
Yeah, it's my fault.

100
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,671
- I'm sorry, Foggy.
- Don't be.

101
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,090
Punisher off the street.

102
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,342
I'm hoping Reyes will get her jackboot off our neck

103
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,594
and this office can go back to normal.

104
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,222
Oh, yeah? Normal? What's that?

105
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:55,768
Matt. Uh, good morning.

106
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,020
Hey, Karen.

107
00:07:58,062 --> 00:07:59,397
Did you sleep well?

108
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,025
Uh, not so much. You?

109
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,901
Me? Yeah, sure.

110
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,194
I mean...

111
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,530
Is that coffee I can smell?

112
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,490
- Hmm?
- Coffee.

113
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,992
Uh, yeah, um...

114
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,119
Yeah, arabica for all.

115
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,080
- For everyone.
- Wow, thank you. You're a goddess.

116
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:18,707
Okay, you two.
Let's talk business.

117
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,834
Potential clients. Real ones.
With bank in the bank.

118
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,047
Uh, actually, yeah, can we, uh...
talk about these first?

119
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,716
The, uh, press is still painting Castle

120
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,761
like he's nothing more than some deranged lunatic.

121
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,722
Well, it's not like our boy was
out collecting for the Red Cross.

122
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,934
- I know. I know, but--
- You think there's more to the story.

123
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,270
Exactly. I mean, five different papers

124
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,189
and not a word about the bullet he took to the brain,

125
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,940
or his military record, or his family.

126
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,983
Uh, his family?

127
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,237
Um...

128
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,405
Okay, uh...

129
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,949
I found this photograph.

130
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,410
It's of him and his wife and kids at the carousel.

131
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,828
You found it where?

132
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,664
I sort of broke into his house.

133
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,665
- You did what?
- What?

134
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,834
- It was ill-advised, I know.
- Not to mention dangerous.

135
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,502
- And illegal.
- Yeah--

136
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,712
It's all that. All of that.

137
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,798
And I don't need a lecture or I will
take those coffees back, okay?

138
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:11,344
Thank you.

139
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,098
Look, it's not just about the press.

140
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,434
The DA's office released their statement
and it's full of holes, too.

141
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,895
Something big is going on here, guys,
and it all circles back to Frank Castle.

142
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,314
- Oh, no, no, no--
- Foggy--

143
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,067
No, come on, we successfully dodged
a metaphorical bullet

144
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,443
and quite a few literal ones.

145
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,279
We need to be done with the crazy, guys.

146
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,905
We need normal.

147
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:38,371
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,874
I'm really sorry if I--

149
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,917
- I pushed it too far.
- It's okay.

150
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,586
I just...

151
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,464
Uh, I don't think you're wrong about Castle, but...

152
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,134
it's really simple, Karen.

153
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,968
Just... I don't want you to get hurt.

154
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,641
So, uh...

155
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,434
Last night.

156
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:01,894
Last night?

157
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,106
I don't-- What happened last night?

158
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,524
- At Josie's? With Foggy?
- You--

159
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,733
- Did something happen?
- Yeah.

160
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,485
- Anything else? I don't--
- Yeah?

161
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,031
Yeah, it was great.

162
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:19,828
And I like to think I can do better,
if we're still on for dinner.

163
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,289
Uh, yeah.

164
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,998
It's a date.

165
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,417
Holy shit!

166
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,003
- That was the bank.
- Oh, no.

167
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,006
No, it's... all good.
There was a deposit.

168
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,675
A big one.

169
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,635
What? Uh...

170
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,054
Um, yeah...

171
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:39,640
Yeah, uh, do me a favor, don't spend any of it.

172
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,058
- Why not?
- God...

173
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:44,061
I was hit up by a potential client
yesterday, so, I just--

174
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,896
Is it dirty money?
Are we doing that again?

175
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,773
No! No, it's nothing like that.
It's just, um...

176
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,942
I'm not sure it's gonna work out, let me...

177
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,110
Let me get into it, I'll--
I'll get back to you.

178
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:59,368
Hey, I'm gonna have a Macallan, neat,
and the lady will have, uh...

179
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,662
another vodka martini.

180
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,039
- Perceptive.
- Thank you, I try.

181
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,791
But I can order my own drinks.

182
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,794
Tequila. Mezcal, if you have it.

183
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,382
So, thanks for your help.

184
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:16,176
It's hard to find reliable security these days.

185
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:20,806
Nice shoes.

186
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,266
What?

187
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,478
Wingtips. Good call.
Shine them yourself?

188
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,980
How'd you know?

189
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,566
You're not exactly a tough read.

190
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:32,568
I...

191
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,986
could surprise you.

192
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,239
Doubt it.

193
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:38,407
All right.

194
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,702
You, uh, wanna give it a try?

195
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,080
Okay.

196
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,625
You desperately want to belong somewhere...

197
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,127
with someone,

198
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,381
which is the real reason why
you sneak into fancy faculty parties.

199
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,716
Not because you're sick of your ramen

200
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,676
and video games routine.

201
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:02,222
And now, your mind is racing.

202
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:08,354
You're wondering what you can possibly
say or do to keep me on the line,

203
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:12,149
because the last thing you want
is to spend the rest of the evening

204
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,152
with that scotch
and that shaggy-haired friend of yours.

205
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,365
You know what your problem is?

206
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,491
You're pretty.

207
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,201
You even work the blind thing.

208
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,412
But you're dumb.

209
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,997
You lost before you even stepped to the plate.

210
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,421
You get all of that from a pair of old wingtips?

211
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,881
Quick study.

212
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,806
- You wanna know what I think?
- Tell me.

213
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,684
I think the game's just beginning.

214
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,481
Because despite your artisan tequilas

215
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,775
and charm-school manners...

216
00:12:56,026 --> 00:13:00,573
Despite being richer than God and having
the whole world at your fingertips...

217
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,076
you're just bored.

218
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:07,830
Really?

219
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,124
Bored enough to spend your time
studying a stranger's shoes.

220
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:18,173
See, I think you were dying on the vine
of this tight-ass party,

221
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,510
because Daddy's money can't buy you
the one thing you really need.

222
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,639
And what's that?

223
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:27,516
The unexpected.

224
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,981
Maybe you're not so dumb.

225
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:36,859
Elektra Natchios.

226
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,986
Matt Murdock.

227
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,076
Let's go, Matthew.

228
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,379
On your left.

229
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,351
Do you like it?

230
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,854
Sounds expensive.

231
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,355
You have good ears.

232
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,779
- Is it yours?
- It is.

233
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,113
Until we get caught.

234
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,000
Mr. Tower?

235
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,045
Uh, I wish you'd called.
I'd have set something up.

236
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,173
- Are they in?
- Uh, just the Nelson half.

237
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,466
What's the problem?

238
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,967
We need to talk.

239
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,928
In private.

240
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,728
You know, it's really not
a good idea to piss her off.

241
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,732
So, what can I do
for the Assistant District Attorney?

242
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:01,485
It's more what I can do for you, Mr. Nelson.

243
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,571
We need all your files on the Grote case.

244
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:06,615
Notes, interviews, any and all
recordings and e-mails.

245
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,116
And in return, we get...

246
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,702
I convince District Attorney Reyes

247
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,455
to scratch the names Nelson
and Murdock off her shit-list.

248
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,206
Wow.

249
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,874
There's an actual list?

250
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,118
- Mr. Nelson, I--
- I'm sorry.

251
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,963
Believe me, the sooner this Punisher
mess is off our plate, the better.

252
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,716
So... show me a subpoena, and...

253
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,219
Is there a problem?

254
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,391
Are you really going to make me
jump through hoops for this?

255
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:37,938
Trust me, there's nothing I'd rather do
more than cooperate with your office.

256
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,484
But a legal firm sharing privileged
communications with a client,

257
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,861
I mean, even a deceased one, without a court order?

258
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,447
I've seen lawyers get disbarred for less.

259
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,076
And I don't know about you, but I worked
really hard for my law degree.

260
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,786
Nights and everything.

261
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,877
Reyes...

262
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,214
she staked all her political chips
on the conviction of this Punisher freak.

263
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,592
Now, if things'll go her way,

264
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,094
there'll be an opening
in the District Attorney's office

265
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,721
in the not-so-distant future.

266
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,016
And DA Tower has a nice ring to it.

267
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,394
Now, I'd start considering
the benefits that could accrue

268
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,522
if your firm were more...

269
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:20,814
cooperative.

270
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:24,401
Like I said...

271
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:28,071
show me a subpoena,
and I'll cooperate like a son of a bitch.

272
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,995
Reyes is gonna roll over you like a tank.

273
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,329
You keep saying that.

274
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,831
And yet...

275
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,458
still kinda here.

276
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,460
I'm gonna have to pay for that.

277
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,920
I'll stake you.

278
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,591
So this is the famous Fogwell's.

279
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,718
Yeah, breathe it in fast.

280
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,931
If we get arrested for breaking
and entering, the fun kinda stops.

281
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,307
Shows what you know.

282
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,643
I haven't been here in a while.

283
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,896
I bet nothing's moved.

284
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,571
- Thanks.
- So tell me.

285
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,366
- How does a blind man box?
- Oh, uh...

286
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,702
I don't... I can't.

287
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,704
My dad, he was the boxer.

288
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,413
Was?

289
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,457
Yeah, he died.

290
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,667
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,005
I just come here to... breathe in the smell of sweat.

292
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,134
Hear the clank of the chains holding the bags.

293
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,551
Remember him.

294
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,681
You never saw your father fight.

295
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:21,309
Oh, I saw him get his ass beat
more times than I can count.

296
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,480
I wasn't born blind.
That's a...

297
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,982
whole other story.

298
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,239
Did he die in the ring?

299
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,784
Uh...

300
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,161
No, boxing didn't kill him.

301
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,328
What did?

302
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,081
Organized crime.

303
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,001
Like a mob hit?

304
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,838
- Was he a criminal?
- No.

305
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,654
But I guess you could say he rubbed
some people the wrong way.

306
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,428
Someone in particular?

307
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,684
Uh, yeah.

308
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,854
A guy named Roscoe Sweeney.

309
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,338
I don't know if he pulled the trigger,
but he gave the order.

310
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,443
Did you ever try to find that piece of shit?

311
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,196
Yeah, once. When I was a kid.

312
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,532
Got nothing.
Learned to live with it.

313
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,035
He probably went underground.

314
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,829
Well, six feet, I hope.

315
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,166
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

316
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,500
I don't.

317
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,377
Are you sure?

318
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,587
Yes.

319
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:33,674
I've seen it.

320
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:37,803
Here and there, over the past few weeks.

321
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,932
You're so much more than you let on.

322
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,977
Okay.

323
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,062
I feel like I've told you more
in the last ten minutes

324
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,647
than I've told anyone else in ten years.

325
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,524
Ha!

326
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,276
I knew it.

327
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,613
You knew what?

328
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,701
You said you were blind.

329
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,703
No, you said I was blind.

330
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,747
So you can see?

331
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,164
It's complicated.

332
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,214
What about you?
You said you took ballet lessons.

333
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,340
I did.

334
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,674
In the winters,

335
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,677
when my capoeira master returned to Angola.

336
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:29,730
Muay Thai?

337
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,065
- Every other Thursday.
- Of course.

338
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,988
You got me.

339
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,490
Get me back.

340
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,409
Get me!

341
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,084
I win.

342
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,130
Yeah, first round, maybe.

343
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,758
We're just getting started.

344
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,787
Ms. Natchios, good afternoon.

345
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,082
Good afternoon.
You can sit.

346
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,963
We hope you know how valuable your business is

347
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,755
to the Roxxon Corporation.

348
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,840
Thank you.

349
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:48,303
This is Stan Gibson.
He's the money man for our Japanese arm.

350
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,763
So, he'll have the answers you're looking for.

351
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,516
Whether or not he can put them
in terms you'll understand

352
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,810
is another matter.

353
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,190
Let's all prepare to be dazzled, shall we?

354
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,241
- Excuse me, uh, Mr. Ellison?
- Yeah?

355
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,159
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.
My name is Karen Page.

356
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,827
- I was a friend of--
- Ben.

357
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,329
Yeah, I remember.

358
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:17,832
Look, I think that I owe you an apology.

359
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,915
- At the funeral, I thought that you--
- Forget it.

360
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,962
Look, Ben...

361
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,548
Ben was a real pain in my ass.

362
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,260
So it follows that his friends would be, too.

363
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,970
What can I do for you?

364
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,181
Well, I don't think you're gonna like my answer.

365
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,017
I'd like to talk to you
about the Frank Castle article.

366
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,769
- I know, terrifying.
- Also inaccurate.

367
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,855
Look...

368
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,733
that article was corroborated by multiple sources.

369
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,195
NYPD, DA's office, we even had some eyewitnesses.

370
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,281
Yes, everything that you reported is correct.

371
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:50,948
It's what you haven't reported that bothers me.

372
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,076
The article is inaccurate by omission.

373
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,996
Okay, come here, come here.

374
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,748
Excuse me, please.

375
00:24:58,831 --> 00:24:59,916
Go.

376
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,630
Right, did you know that two years ago,
Lieutenant Frank Castle

377
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,924
was awarded the Navy Cross
for his service in Afghanistan, right?

378
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,842
That's second only to the Medal of Honor.

379
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,261
This guy is a war hero.

380
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,221
Military history is the first thing we search

381
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,265
whenever there's a mass shooting.

382
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:19,186
So, we know that he was a Marine recruit,
and we know that he went in as a kid,

383
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,521
but there's no evidence that he actually served.

384
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,440
I've seen the medal,

385
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,941
engraved with Castle's name,

386
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,277
next to a photograph of him
shaking the secretary's hand.

387
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,947
Are you suggesting that his work was classified?

388
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,241
I don't know, but--
But I would assume.

389
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,285
Don't assume. Where'd you see it?

390
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,455
Uh, not important.

391
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,872
Pretty important.

392
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,999
Look, your article also states
that he had no known relatives,

393
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,751
but every paper in New York says that.

394
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:46,879
Well, that was in the press briefing
issued by the DA's office.

395
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,215
He had a family.

396
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:52,802
He had a wife, Maria Elizabeth,
a daughter, Lisa Barbara,

397
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,721
and a son, Frank Junior.

398
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,682
- Had?
- All dead.

399
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,685
Killed around the same time
that Castle was hospitalized

400
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,270
for a gunshot wound to the head.

401
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,355
What, so...

402
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,316
What, you're saying that he murdered
his family and then shot himself?

403
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,943
Some sort of PTSD murder-suicide attempt?

404
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,027
No, see, if that's what had happened,

405
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:11,363
the DA would have put it in her brief,

406
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,905
in flashing neon if she could,

407
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,867
because that supports her story
that he's a psychopath.

408
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,912
So, what do you think really happened?

409
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,250
That's what I don't know yet.

410
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,461
But if I could dig through your files
or I could check into your back issues,

411
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,004
maybe I could figure it out.

412
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:32,217
And anything that I find, anything that I can prove--

413
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,136
The Bulletin gets the exclusive.

414
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,388
Deal.

415
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:38,723
Okay, deal.

416
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:42,269
Uh-uh... don't do any somersaults yet.

417
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,153
All the, uh...

418
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,696
All the servers were completely
wiped in the incident.

419
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,698
Decades, just...

420
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:56,866
gone.

421
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,911
So, um, we keep hard copies of everything now.

422
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,621
Jeez! Are they in any kind of order?

423
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,290
Um, you know, roughly.

424
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,542
I would... I would start, uh, down here.

425
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,502
- Okay. Uh, thanks.
- Uh-huh.

426
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,007
- What?
- Oh...

427
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,718
Uh, nothing, I'm just thinking, uh, somewhere...

428
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:19,472
Ben Urich is looking down, and just...

429
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,849
getting a real kick out of all this.

430
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:24,519
Have fun.

431
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,825
I'm sure you all have places to be, things to do.

432
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,619
With your wives, your mistresses...

433
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,080
But I have questions.

434
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,460
And this subsidiary, what is it exactly?

435
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,546
- A medical company.
- And they do?

436
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:54,173
- Studies.
- How specific.

437
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,759
Research for pain relievers, treatments for diseases.

438
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,637
The names of which I mostly can't pronounce.

439
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,931
How do you determine your acquisitions?

440
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,933
Well--

441
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,102
Excuse me.

442
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,734
There's an issue with our server.

443
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,402
Someone has hacked into the server.

444
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:17,239
Possibly internal, we don't know yet,
security is looking into it.

445
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:23,370
If it's an external threat,
I'm sure they can trace the IP address

446
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:28,250
and deal with the "problem" face-to-face.

447
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:32,169
But I'm more concerned about what information

448
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:38,301
they can pull from Roxxon's system
when it is offline.

449
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,637
I'm terribly sorry, something has come up.

450
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,306
Could we reconvene at another time?

451
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,849
Absolutely.

452
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,227
Thank you.

453
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:50,355
I'll have someone escort you downstairs.

454
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,939
Thank you.

455
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,817
In this city, a girl needs all the help she can get.

456
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,493
Why is it gray?

457
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,870
One of life's mysteries.

458
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,384
They were out of olives.

459
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,928
So?

460
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,681
So...

461
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,474
What?

462
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:28,893
It was a hard day.

463
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,521
I thought we could catch up, you know, have a drink.

464
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,022
Just...

465
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,231
be like we were.

466
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,983
Normal.

467
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,279
I haven't heard from you in months.

468
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:41,739
Well, that's...

469
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,616
not all that abnormal, right?

470
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,787
Yeah, I guess you're right.

471
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,333
Let's get trashed and tell each other
our sob stories. You first.

472
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,585
Matt's dating our office assistant.

473
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,421
The cute one?
Blonde, totally your type?

474
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:57,839
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

475
00:29:58,423 --> 00:29:59,674
The correct answer is,

476
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,802
"No one is as perfect for me as you, Marci."

477
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:03,970
Gets worse.

478
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,888
We lost two clients in the last hour.

479
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,099
Oh, it's kinda like when I lost the job
at Landman and Zack.

480
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,977
- Thank God HC and B was hiring.
- No, I'm serious.

481
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,228
It's the DA.

482
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,815
I called her bluff on a case
she's building against the Punisher

483
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:16,983
and she doubled down.

484
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:18,943
She's coming after us.

485
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:20,612
I see.

486
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,865
You didn't call me for a social drink.

487
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,700
You called me for help.

488
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:29,621
That feels more normal.

489
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,671
Fine.

490
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,885
Rumors among my new partners?

491
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,970
Reyes has her sights on the mayor's office.

492
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,307
This is my shocked face.

493
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,519
And she aims to do so by...

494
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,480
building a platform on Frank Castle's conviction.

495
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,106
She gets him...

496
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,485
she sets precedent against
these other vigilantes popping up.

497
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,195
One in our office is already under serious scrutiny,

498
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,490
lady by the name of Jessica Jones.

499
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,450
Oh, and you know who I bet is next?

500
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,076
The horny one.

501
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,787
It's... Daredevil.

502
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,416
You think it'll work?

503
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:20,713
She's gonna turn city-wide disaster
into damn fine lemonade.

504
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,049
It's her big power play.

505
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,717
It's gonna work.

506
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,904
- Hey.
- Hey.

507
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,366
It's been... whoa, three hours.

508
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,993
Oh, God.

509
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:53,455
And I'm almost late for dinner.

510
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,748
- Thanks.
- Any luck?

511
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,586
Well, these are all the papers
from the week that Castle was shot.

512
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,421
I've been through each one of them three times,

513
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,923
and there's not a single mention
of Castle, his family...

514
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,092
Not even a John Doe that matches.

515
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,384
Just nothing.

516
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,721
Well, you know, people are shot every day.

517
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,347
It doesn't always make the paper.

518
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,307
Cleavered Cleavers.

519
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,434
What's that?

520
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,479
Ah, just an old newspaper adage, right?

521
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:19,802
If horror befalls a family
you can paint as all-American,

522
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,441
it makes the front page.

523
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:24,235
So, if the Castles are not in this paper,

524
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,403
it's because somebody wants to keep it quiet.

525
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:27,864
Well, shit.

526
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,243
April 14th.

527
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,538
When was the Castle family murdered?

528
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,082
Well, I figure it's gotta be
sometime that week, right?

529
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,919
You know, I cannot remember my...
my kids' birthdays, but...

530
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:46,132
violent, soul-sucking events
are just seared into my brain.

531
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:47,509
Figures, right?

532
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,261
Ah, yes, yes.

533
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:53,055
Okay, gang-on-gang violence.

534
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,391
No civilians were reported injured, so nobody cared.

535
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,519
It took me a week to get this in the paper.

536
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:58,770
Here.

537
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,273
Three gangs, Central Park, mid-day.

538
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,817
They shot each other to shit.
It was a total massacre.

539
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,444
Mexican Cartel, Dogs of Hell...

540
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,113
- Kitchen Irish.
- ...Kitchen Irish.

541
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,240
- Those were all the three--
- That the Punisher gunned down.

542
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,563
- There's gotta be a connection, right?
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

543
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,746
- Oh, my God.
- What?

544
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:17,914
Oh, my God.

545
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:26,756
This is it.

546
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,091
This is where his family was killed.

547
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,218
Shit, what do I do now?

548
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,512
Confirm it.

549
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,265
- Can I borrow this?
- Yeah, sure.

550
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,767
Just a little reminder...

551
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,102
Bulletin gets the exclusive, right?

552
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,479
- You got it, boss.
- Wait, you're going now?

553
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:43,690
Really?

554
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,198
Do you drink wine?

555
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,825
I should know that.

556
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,870
I don't drink anything they don't serve at Josie's.

557
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,456
Yeah, well, I don't see swill on the menu.

558
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:06,588
- So how was--
- So what did--

559
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:07,991
- I'm sorry--
- I was just gonna--

560
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,758
Uh, you go ahead.
Go, go first.

561
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,720
How was your day?

562
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:14,804
Fine.

563
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,973
Uh, yeah, just a regular day at the office.

564
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:19,058
Well, it's a nice change of pace, right?

565
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,184
Not being shot at?

566
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,395
- That's gotta feel good.
- Yeah.

567
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,399
You, how's the, uh, new client?

568
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,986
Uh, yeah, um...

569
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:33,072
Nothing I haven't seen before.

570
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,908
I seriously doubt it's gonna pan out, but that's...

571
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:37,619
That's fine.

572
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,286
Okay, good.

573
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:45,042
Well, that covers work.

574
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,045
Uh, well, it's a start.

575
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:54,260
- Um, I'll be back in just a minute, um...
- Yeah.

576
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,888
- Order something fantastic.
- Sure.

577
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,022
- Sir?
- Look.

578
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,650
If I had to seem like I knew everything
there is to know about wines

579
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:11,152
in the next 60 seconds, what would I...
what would I order?

580
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:12,904
- Matthew Murdock?
- Yeah.

581
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,280
You have a call.

582
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,407
Oh, thanks.

583
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,201
This is Murdock.

584
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,288
Sorry to bother you while you're out,

585
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,207
but you have a few moments before she returns, right?

586
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,670
What do you want from me?

587
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,798
You should ask yourself the same question.

588
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,050
That rooftop act was cute.

589
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,678
Yeah, nothing compared
to your damsel-in-distress one.

590
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:41,057
Oh, you're right.
I didn't actually need you.

591
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,184
I told you, maybe I just missed you.

592
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,144
But don't worry, you can keep the money.

593
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:48,480
Aw...

594
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:49,565
Go to hell.

595
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:53,402
If you really want to be done,
consider this me firing you.

596
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,721
Any time you want to drive...

597
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:23,224
I think it's illegal, driving under
the influence of blindness.

598
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:24,684
You're the future lawyer.

599
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,936
Yeah, I should start going to class again, then.

600
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,772
- Hey, where are we?
- A house.

601
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:33,192
Yeah. Is it yours?

602
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,945
Oh, God, no.
I'd die in the suburbs.

603
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,197
No, this charming little chateau

604
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,118
belongs to one of my father's many work associates,

605
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:46,455
who's currently off to Monte Carlo,
where prostitution is legal.

606
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:48,708
So...

607
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,667
you have the keys, right?

608
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,466
Welcome home, darling.
Dinner's almost ready.

609
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,553
- Tiny kitchen.
- Mmm-hmm.

610
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,892
Okay, so we have, uh...

611
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:09,645
truffles, saucissons, cornichons...

612
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:10,980
- Baby pickles.
- No.

613
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,398
- Ugh!
- Okay, got it.

614
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,150
No cornichons.

615
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,359
So...

616
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,530
- when you graduate...
- Mmm-hmm.

617
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,199
- ...and we get married...
- Wow.

618
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:25,661
...and we buy a house...
I mean, houses, sorry.

619
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:28,164
Santorini, San Sebastian...

620
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,999
Paris, for when we're feeling cosmopolitan.

621
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,960
This...

622
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,545
is how we'll live.

623
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,510
And what about the kids?

624
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,470
What are we gonna do with them?

625
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:46,390
Oh, you know, sweet little Ellie, and...

626
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,935
her simpleton brother, Matty Junior...

627
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,770
...can cook and clean

628
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:53,480
and stock the fridge for us, so we can use...

629
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,942
our time doing better things.

630
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,735
Like sex?

631
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,072
Exactly like sex.

632
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:03,157
Who's thirsty?

633
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,121
- Hey.
- Mmm?

634
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:11,791
- Is it good?
- What?

635
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,042
This.

636
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,795
All of this, this, uh...

637
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,629
life.

638
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,506
It's fantastic.

639
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:26,848
But I would trade it all in
for a lifetime of smelling your skin.

640
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,486
Cheers.

641
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,039
- Sounded expensive.
- I'm guessing.

642
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,291
I don't care.

643
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,090
Get me?

644
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,967
I do, I get you.

645
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,301
When are you going to learn?

646
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,762
Get me.

647
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:12,684
I have learned.

648
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:15,396
You know me.

649
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,275
Like no one else ever has.
And I know you.

650
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:22,236
We belong together.

651
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,412
Someone's here.

652
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,455
Daddy's friend probably ran out of Viagra--

653
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,665
Shh...

654
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,417
They're footsteps. Moving fast.
Let me go check.

655
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,628
No, no, no, no, no.
You stay here.

656
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,505
If I explain everything, he won't be mad.

657
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,589
I promise.

658
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:04,361
Matthew, you remember Roscoe Sweeney,

659
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,363
the son of a bitch who killed your father?

660
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,743
Hey.

661
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,287
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

662
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,332
- Yeah, they ran out of wine.
- No.

663
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,583
Wait, seriously?

664
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:20,586
Matt...

665
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,632
I don't...
I don't like this place, you know?

666
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,804
Is it the place? Or is it--

667
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,223
It's definitely not you.

668
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,476
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

669
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,893
I'm positive.

670
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:43,359
Come on.
I know where we can go.

671
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:47,029
- Thank you.
- Wow, this smells amazing.

672
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,324
- What is it?
- Um...

673
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,284
Who cares?
They have wine.

674
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:53,785
Right.

675
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,079
That's...

676
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:58,165
You know, I've always felt
more comfortable with the cheap stuff.

677
00:40:58,249 --> 00:40:59,833
- You know?
- Yeah?

678
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,710
Well, here, I'll drink to that.

679
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:07,341
Cheap stuff.

680
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:09,468
Cheap stuff.

681
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,973
You know, I never even had
Indian food until a few months ago.

682
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:16,308
How is that possible?

683
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:19,103
Well, my hometown in Vermont had about 400 people,

684
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,938
so the most ethnic food it offered was French fries.

685
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:27,028
So that's why you, uh, came to New York?
For the... for the food?

686
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,613
Uh, no.

687
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,496
Although, if I knew places like this existed,

688
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,200
I'd have left Vermont ages ago.

689
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:37,538
- You see, that's why I love this city.
- Hmm?

690
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,248
I've lived here my whole life, and...

691
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,552
the place never stops unfolding new secrets.

692
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:43,585
Hmm.

693
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,130
Yeah, you know...

694
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,549
despite the crime,

695
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:50,092
and the darkness,

696
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,803
every once in a while, New York makes me feel...

697
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,222
Like, safe?

698
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:57,141
- Yes, is that weird?
- Well...

699
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:58,559
- Huh.
- I get it.

700
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:01,853
I wish you could see this place.

701
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:06,567
I can, if you describe it to me.

702
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,696
So, anyways, my favorite part...

703
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,198
is the ceiling.

704
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:18,162
So, it's literally dripping with thousands of lights.

705
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,081
They're shaped like chili peppers...

706
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:24,626
which sounds really tacky, I know,
but it's, um, it's not.

707
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:27,754
Just...

708
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:29,631
It's magic.

709
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,682
This is me.

710
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:44,938
Are you sure you don't...

711
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,648
live two more blocks?

712
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,025
- Maybe three?
- I wish.

713
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:53,280
We could sit.

714
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:54,365
Yeah.

715
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:09,130
All right, I'm gonna kiss ya.

716
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,027
You could come up...

717
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:34,655
if you like.

718
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:38,992
I would love to.

719
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,248
But you won't.

720
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,251
Not tonight.

721
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,505
- It's okay.
- Can I...

722
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,382
Can I tell you why?

723
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,511
Because I have this...

724
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:01,807
incredible ability to bring...

725
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,852
disaster to the best things in my life
and tonight has been perfect.

726
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:09,523
Don't you think?

727
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:12,776
Yes.

728
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:18,699
And if I stop now, then I get to keep
this one perfect night.

729
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:24,663
And also have the chance
of keeping it going tomorrow.

730
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:31,795
And the day after...

731
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,054
And the day after that...

732
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,056
And the...

733
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,267
Exactly.

734
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,196
Then I guess it's good night...

735
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,115
Mr. Murdock.

736
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,536
Good night, Ms. Page.

737
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,498
Fix me up, man?
Fix me up.

738
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:54,210
I know who you are, man!
I know who you are!

739
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,302
How much you got, man?
How much you got?

740
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:10,561
Oh, Jesus Christ.

741
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:13,772
When I get out of this...

742
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,610
Oh, I'll remember your faces.

743
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:20,612
Every single bit of them...

744
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:24,700
- I will hunt you!
- Aw...

745
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:26,368
When you get out?

746
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:28,412
Where did you find him?

747
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,540
Monte Carlo.
I wasn't lying.

748
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:35,877
He's been going by an alias for years now.

749
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:38,505
Al Marino.

750
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:41,758
An ugly name for an ugly man.

751
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,594
Oh, you're dead.

752
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:45,554
Both of ya!

753
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,848
Couple of kids playing house!

754
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,433
Hey!

755
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:51,059
Watch your tongue.

756
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,268
While it's still attached.

757
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:56,607
He tried to hide.
Went underground.

758
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,443
But the scum always rises.

759
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:02,363
Al just couldn't stay anonymous.

760
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:04,365
He had to spend his blood money.

761
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:06,282
Make a splash.

762
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:07,868
Be the big man.

763
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,620
You made it easy for me.

764
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:11,079
Eat shit.

765
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:14,040
Want me to hit you again?

766
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:17,210
Well, I won't.

767
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,670
But he will.

768
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:33,018
I don't know him from Christ,
but one look and I can tell.

769
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,938
Pretty boy ain't got it in him.

770
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:39,315
You don't remember me?

771
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:44,154
You killed my father.

772
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:46,364
Well, I hate to break it to you, son...

773
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:49,451
but I killed a lot of guys' dads.

774
00:47:49,535 --> 00:47:50,994
Then let me help you.

775
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,705
He hit hard.

776
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:56,207
Like this.

777
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:17,771
You call that hard?

778
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:20,065
Let it out.

779
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:21,191
Let it out.

780
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:23,902
Okay? Whatever's inside you.

781
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,862
Do it for your father, Matthew.

782
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:27,448
Do it for us.

783
00:48:27,531 --> 00:48:29,115
Come on.

784
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:30,826
"Matthew"?

785
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:35,581
You're Battlin' Jack's boy!

786
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:37,916
Oh, you amateur.

787
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,627
Now I know your name.

788
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:46,842
Nothing'll stop me from bloodying
the street with your corpse.

789
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,928
Just like I did to your old man!

790
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,058
Yes.

791
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:11,366
End it.

792
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,701
End it now.

793
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,410
- What?
- Keep going.

794
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,664
No, that's, uh...

795
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:22,127
- No, that's all I got.
- No...

796
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,837
He knows your name.

797
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:26,381
Cut his throat.

798
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,674
Kill him.

799
00:49:27,758 --> 00:49:28,925
What?

800
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,136
Kill him.

801
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:40,812
I can't do that.

802
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:45,275
We can do anything together.

803
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,860
Remember?

804
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,330
No, I can't.

805
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:08,506
I thought you understood me.

806
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:11,217
Yeah, I thought I did, too.

807
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,430
We need to call the police.

808
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:29,069
- 911, what is your emergency?
- Um...

809
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:32,864
Yes, I'd like to report
the location of a wanted felon.

810
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:36,702
The name is Roscoe Sweeney.

811
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:38,453
What is the address?

812
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:10,568
See? You missed me, too.

813
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,202
Did you have a nice dinner?

814
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:28,544
Elektra, I came here to ask you a question,

815
00:51:28,629 --> 00:51:30,797
and I'd like for you to answer it.

816
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:40,682
Why did you take me to that mansion?

817
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:44,602
That's your question?

818
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:47,522
For fun.

819
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,525
For fun?

820
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:53,945
That's fun for you?

821
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,532
To try to push me into killing a man?

822
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:58,742
Oh...

823
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:03,496
I didn't push you into anything.

824
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:06,750
And you didn't kill anyone.

825
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:09,670
- But you wanted to.
- No, I didn't.

826
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:12,130
Don't do that, don't...
Not now, don't...

827
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,299
You act like you have some window into my soul,

828
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,677
but you don't, and you never have.

829
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:23,058
There was always this glorious darkness inside you.

830
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,225
No.

831
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:26,978
That's why I took you to Roscoe Sweeney's.

832
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:31,524
And, yes.

833
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:34,360
That's why I loved you.

834
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:39,866
That's why you loved me, too.

835
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:43,704
Don't deny what we have.

836
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:47,290
Please.

837
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,919
You think that's what love is?

838
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:56,549
Someone... someone's coming.

839
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,053
Mmm-hmm.

840
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:02,180
The elevator's moving--

841
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,473
There's...

842
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:05,516
There's a silencer in the lobby.

843
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:07,894
Who is it, Elektra?

844
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:09,813
If I had to guess, Yakuza.

845
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:12,690
No.

846
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:15,235
No, that's impossible.
I took care of the Yakuza.

847
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,988
Clearly, you didn't.
Hold my gloves?

848
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:23,284
Today, at the Yakatomi Building, I infiltrated Asano,

849
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:26,079
the Japanese branch of Roxxon,

850
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:28,373
and I planted a little bug to crash their system.

851
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:30,541
Yeah, I heard it.

852
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,836
You knew they'd come for you?

853
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:34,629
Well, I knew they'd come here.

854
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,883
This building isn't in my name.
I'm no amateur.

855
00:53:37,966 --> 00:53:40,010
Hold on a second, did you know I'd come?

856
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:42,512
My confidence was high.

857
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:46,432
You planned this.

858
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:48,059
Everything you said in the apartment, it's just lies.

859
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:49,623
You don't mean it, you're not sorry...

860
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:50,686
It's just manipulation with you.

861
00:53:50,771 --> 00:53:51,813
- It's the same thing--
- No!

862
00:53:51,897 --> 00:53:53,189
Over and over again, you just manipulate!

863
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:54,274
Matthew!

864
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:56,484
- I told you, I know you.
- You don't.

865
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,986
I've always known you.

866
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,280
- Then, and now.
- No, you don't know me.

867
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:02,240
So, now, you tell me.

868
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,535
- You can handle them yourself.
- Do I need to push you this time?
