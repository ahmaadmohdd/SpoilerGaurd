1
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:17,561
Potential juror number 17, please state your name.

2
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:19,395
Richard Day.

3
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,524
Can you state for the court
any preexisting opinion, any at all,

4
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:25,860
that you may hold for the defendant, Frank Castle?

5
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:29,072
You mean the Punisher?
I think he's an animal...

6
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:31,741
a sick, twisted, venal...

7
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:34,327
Hero.
That's what we should be calling him.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,663
Doing the things the cops won't do,
Frank Castle is a...

9
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,040
A grotesque insult to the Second Amendment,

10
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:42,168
a fascist without the authority.
If you ask me,

11
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,837
people like Frank Castle ought to be...

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,297
Applauded for putting all the thieves

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,008
and muggers and rapists in the morgue,
where they belong.

14
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:54,305
Let those bastards feel scared
walking down the street for a change.

15
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,742
It's Son of Sam all over again.

16
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:14,951
It's Bernie Goetz...

17
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,954
It's like the only thing protecting us is Frank.

18
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:19,706
I just moved my family to New York,
and now we're moving out.

19
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:23,793
If anyone can kill anyone in this town...
where does the insanity end?

20
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,189
Counselors, over 400 potential jurors
have come through this courtroom.

21
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,482
So I should tell you,

22
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,695
if you can't agree to move forward
with the 12 men and women selected,

23
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:53,865
I will make this trial a living hell for all of you.

24
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:57,201
Your Honor, New York hasn't seen a trial
this divisive and this public in years.

25
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,746
Finding an impartial jury is not easy.

26
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,040
Everybody has an opinion about Frank Castle.

27
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:06,753
It's New York, Mr. Nelson.
Everybody has an opinion about everything.

28
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:10,924
Ms. Reyes, is the prosecution
satisfied with its jury panel?

29
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,885
- Yes, Your Honor.
- And the defense, Mr. Nelson?

30
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,599
- Uh, yes, Your Honor, we are.
- Thank Christ.

31
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,689
The trial of The People of New York v. Frank Castle

32
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,565
is now in session.

33
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:07,123
If I get my hands on the worthless intern
who organized these files...

34
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,918
Oh, I'm sure that intern's
just following the DA's orders.

35
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,460
It's not officially sabotage,

36
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,380
- just sets it back.
- It's a cheap trick.

37
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:18,301
We got bigger problems.
Like, locking a defense.

38
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,137
- M'Naghten Rule's still our best bet.
- What's that?

39
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,598
- Uh, the, uh, insanity plea.
- Whoa, whoa, guys...

40
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,725
We need to buy a "not guilty" verdict.

41
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,770
My high school debate team
could prove that Castle did it.

42
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,188
We need an affirmative defense.

43
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,982
Yeah, yeah, I get that,
but I'm not so sure Frank is insane.

44
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,111
I'm no doctor, but I'd say he's at least
driven past Crazy Town.

45
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,780
- Foggy, I'm serious.
- She has a point.

46
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:42,366
I mean, insanity only has a 0.12%
acquittal rate in New York.

47
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,577
Reyes is just gonna call in

48
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,121
some expert shrink witness to blow our case apart.

49
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,623
- What case?
- Look, what if we...

50
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,585
push for a mistrial?
We get more time.

51
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,796
We talk about the DNR and the suits
and Reyes' involvement.

52
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,965
We get her kicked off the case.

53
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,716
She wouldn't see it coming.

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,846
If we go down that road now,
we gotta prove, in a court of law,

55
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:06,349
that the government willfully
hid evidence of the Punisher ambush,

56
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:07,934
and that Reyes was involved.

57
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:11,270
- Well, I was there and you were there.
- We're not exactly impartial, okay?

58
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,857
And either way, we need
an opening statement tomorrow.

59
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,400
I can open with PTSD as a mitigating factor,

60
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,776
focus on Castle's time at war.

61
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,946
So you think the war is what made Frank what he is?

62
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,656
Our only goal is to reduce the charges
and set precedent.

63
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,408
Castle made a lot of enemies, all right?

64
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,452
If he goes into general population,
he's as good as dead.

65
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,372
We need to get him somewhere safe,
where he can get help, and...

66
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:30,495
citing PTSD could do that.

67
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,584
I mean, none of us know what Castle saw over there...

68
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:39,048
but research suggests that...
PTSD can be triggered by new stressors.

69
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:40,466
Like losing your family.

70
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,010
I need to get to work on the opening statement,

71
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,137
but we need to be sure
Castle will get on board with this.

72
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,804
Uh, I'll try.

73
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,557
I mean, Frank made it pretty clear
he's willing to talk to me, at least,

74
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,226
just as long as I'm alone.

75
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:54,022
- Are you sure you wanna do that?
- Well, I wanna help.

76
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,524
We have a better shot at getting him to talk if I go.

77
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,903
I'll grab the list of questions I was working on.

78
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,905
Okay.

79
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,950
Karen...

80
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:10,579
You know you don't have to do this by yourself.

81
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:13,166
It's okay.
Castle doesn't scare me.

82
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,795
- Maybe he should.
- I can take care of myself.

83
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,341
I know... but I'd be saying it to Foggy.

84
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,677
Or a Navy SEAL.

85
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,806
Just watch your back.

86
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,519
Promise.

87
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,606
Here you go.
Just do me a favor, stick to the script.

88
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,691
Okay.

89
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:43,029
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

90
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,409
Grow up so fast, don't they?

91
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,312
- Hi, Frank.
- Ma'am.

92
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,367
Um, we've been, uh, looking over similar cases...

93
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,701
legal precedents, and, uh...

94
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:16,372
we... we think it would help
to bring forth someone from your past...

95
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,917
maybe from your... your military unit,
someone who could, uh...

96
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,710
speak to the nature of your service.

97
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:26,132
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Um... it's a character witness.

98
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,386
Uh, we put someone on the stand who...
who knows you well.

99
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,430
Uh, can... can speak to what you've been through.

100
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,598
PTSD, huh?

101
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,726
We think it would greatly help with your defense.

102
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,688
Don't do that.
It's an insult.

103
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,232
Lots of veterans experience it.

104
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:44,900
I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about them.

105
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,820
It's an insult to them,
people who are actually going through it.

106
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:51,282
I know what you wanna do,
you wanna sit here and label me

107
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:55,161
just another case of some crazy-ass
combat vet who lost his mind, huh?

108
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:59,040
Maybe that'll appeal to some shitbag jury
in some shitbag court.

109
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,294
It wasn't on a battlefield.

110
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,340
That's not when my life went to shit.

111
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,677
Now, ma'am, I believe that you told me
that you were gonna find me answers.

112
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,721
That's what you said to me.
Do you have anything for me or not?

113
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:14,972
- Not that easy.
- That what you want?

114
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,100
- You want things to be easy?
- You are on trial

115
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:20,186
for multiple homicides and you don't
have a defense strategy in place.

116
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,064
You don't cooperate with us,

117
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,566
it doesn't matter if I help you
figure out who killed your family,

118
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:26,942
you will never see justice.

119
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,740
All you will do, the rest of your life,
is rot in a goddamn jail cell!

120
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,835
Colonel Ray Schoonover.
My old CO.

121
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,133
Let's forget the PTSD defense,
but if you want a character witness,

122
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,717
the colonel, he will do.

123
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,095
Thank you.

124
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:57,014
Now, ma'am, do you have anything for me or not?

125
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:02,603
Maybe I just ought to go back
and rot in my goddamn jail cell?

126
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,774
Yeah.
Yeah, I did some digging.

127
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,403
All right, there are huge moving parts
and they do not want to be seen.

128
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,239
I've already looked at all of those.
I've done it a hundred times.

129
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,032
Sure...

130
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,534
but you haven't done it with me.

131
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,462
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

132
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:31,674
Imagine, if you will--

133
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,304
Yeah, this is Matt.

134
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:39,432
- I found a lead.
- Hold on.

135
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,232
Elektra, I can't do this right now.

136
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,568
The guy who encoded that ledger of ours?

137
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,695
Some pervy NYU professor,

138
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:55,448
master cryptographer who teaches Asian studies.

139
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,866
I'm gonna go beat the cipher out of him.

140
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,243
- Yeah.
- You wanna come?

141
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,536
- Hey.
- Hey.

142
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,288
You check out these Dogs of Hell depos?

143
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,414
Might as well have been written in crayon.

144
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,790
I think we could poke some holes in these.

145
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,713
That's great. Yeah.
Just, uh, give me a minute.

146
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,636
The most important case we've ever handled
starts in the morning.

147
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,054
I can't go with you.

148
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,848
- Can't or won't?
- Can't.

149
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,351
My life doesn't stop every time you call.

150
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:26,144
This may be our one chance to translate this ledger

151
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:30,233
before the Yakuza adjust their plans
and we lose all the progress we've made.

152
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,484
You're infuriating.

153
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,194
Tell me in person. Two hours.
Barclay and Church.

154
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,323
I know I'm into some sick shit,
but next time, I swear,

155
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:41,285
all I wanna do is eat moo goo gai pan
off your bodies.

156
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:44,663
All day.

157
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:48,542
- We're not Chinese.
- Whatever, it's all hot to me.

158
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,295
What?

159
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,589
He's a repulsive asshole.

160
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,635
A repulsive asshole who pays well.

161
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:03,266
I can't tell any of you apart, but I guarantee...

162
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:07,270
I know all your tongues better than you do.

163
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:10,230
So... be nice.

164
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,150
Get out.

165
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,210
Hey, honey, I'm home.

166
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:35,381
And you've been awfully naughty.

167
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,554
You're gonna wanna stay real still.

168
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,693
What the hell do you want from me?

169
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,779
- You were hired by the Yakuza.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

170
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,864
You encrypted files for them.

171
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,908
Money must be good.

172
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,828
Not many professors can afford
garish, high-rise flats

173
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,331
and a revolving door of prostitutes.

174
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,707
What do you want me to do?

175
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,711
What you do best, Philip.
Translate.

176
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:14,837
But this time for us.

177
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,131
They will kill me if I tell you anything.

178
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,258
And if you don't, we'll make you beg for killing.

179
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,894
Thirty stories up, Philip.

180
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,980
You'd make a mighty good mess.

181
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,399
More liquid than solid, I'd imagine.

182
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,736
- What do you say, Professor?
- Come on, please...

183
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,238
Please... please.

184
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,121
- I'll pay you, I'll do anything.
- Once more.

185
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,453
I can't.
I can't, they'll kill me.

186
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,580
It's gonna break.

187
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,998
Okay!
Okay, shit!

188
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,916
Stop! I'll do it! I'll do it!

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,042
I'll help you.

190
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:06,680
All right, be a pet and tell us
how to read this last page.

191
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,027
They wanted a code that couldn't be hacked.

192
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,275
I put the Japanese alphabet...

193
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,068
through a cipher.

194
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,905
Now...

195
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,909
put the characters through the matrix,
you can decode it all.

196
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,452
You do it.

197
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,923
There's weekly shipments.

198
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,384
Next one is tonight at 11:00.

199
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,595
Bay Ridge Rail Yard.

200
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,014
You find a boxcar with that number...

201
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,768
and you can find the train you're looking for.

202
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,019
What are they shipping?

203
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,146
It doesn't say, I swear.

204
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,691
- I swear!
- I can't help you anymore.

205
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:06,073
Well, thank you for your help, Professor.

206
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,994
Do yourself a favor.
Find better business partners.

207
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,080
And kill your decorator.

208
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,187
Hey. Hungry?

209
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,566
No. I don't think I'm ever gonna eat again.

210
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,444
Cost of looking at these all day.

211
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,321
Yeah.
How about some fresh coffee?

212
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,156
Yes.

213
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,579
Uh, where's Matt?

214
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,206
I thought he'd be burning the midnight oil with you.

215
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,917
I... He's, um...

216
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,253
He's working on his opening statements.

217
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,005
Oh.

218
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,341
Did you... you talk to Castle?

219
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,470
Yeah, um...

220
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,850
He, uh, won't endorse PTSD, so...

221
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,644
Oh, shit!

222
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,104
He's... he's not having war flashbacks, Foggy.

223
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,481
It... it's just not the truth.

224
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,441
Did Castle say anything that we can use?

225
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:25,443
'Cause when the judge
calls his first witness tomorrow,

226
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:28,947
my only plan so far is to run away, and...

227
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,866
open a butcher shop.

228
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,912
Well... I, uh, went over
some of our files with Frank.

229
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,498
The medical examiner's report
from his family's murder,

230
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:38,749
it's filled out by a, um...

231
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,877
- Dr. Gregory Tepper.
- Yeah.

232
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,796
He's the chief medical examiner.

233
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,089
He's scheduled to testify for Reyes.

234
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:51,428
Well... his report says
that Lisa, Frank, Jr. and Maria Castle

235
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:55,641
each were killed by a single gunshot,
but Frank says there were multiple wounds.

236
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,769
He describes them in awful detail, um...

237
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,564
different angles, uh...

238
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,441
bullet calibers, exit wounds
that are too big for a handgun.

239
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,528
I mean, his family was practically shredded.

240
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:11,657
There's a discrepancy, which is good, but...

241
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,869
it's still their word against Frank's,
who was also shot in the head.

242
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:16,954
Okay.

243
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,873
Just for a minute...

244
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,961
try... try to be Frank Castle.

245
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,672
To be solely fueled by...

246
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:30,050
by a single cluster of seconds.

247
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,638
One moment in... in your entire life...

248
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,103
And every time you close your eyes,
you relive that moment.

249
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,148
And every time you open them, you find only the...

250
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:50,153
the briefest peace before you realize
that that nightmare is real.

251
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:53,531
That nothing has changed.

252
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,452
Your family isn't coming back.

253
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:00,873
And so you watch them die...

254
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,167
all over again right in front of you.

255
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,380
We're not talking about something
that happened to Frank Castle,

256
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,424
we're talking about something
that is happening to him.

257
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,096
I hear you.

258
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,766
But...

259
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,060
short of having his family's bodies exhumed...

260
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,857
we still have no proof
that what Frank is saying is the truth.

261
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,945
Okay, so...

262
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,825
Let's say the ME's report... was doctored.

263
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:40,245
It's still tangential and, so far, inadmissible.

264
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,708
What?

265
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,629
Unless we can get this ME to corroborate
Frank's story on the stand.

266
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,256
Can you do that?

267
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,052
It's a long shot.
He's still probably in her pocket, but...

268
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,054
if it works...

269
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,640
maybe we expose Reyes

270
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,684
and we get the mistrial you've been praying for.

271
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:05,729
So, trial starts in a few hours,

272
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,648
and in lieu of a bullet-damaged brain,

273
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:11,902
our case hinges on getting a dirty medical examiner

274
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,320
to crack on the stand.

275
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:17,658
Guess I'll call Matt.
Give him the news.

276
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:18,867
Oh, I'll do it.

277
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:22,204
As long as he has
the opening statement of the year, I'd...

278
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,582
I think maybe we have a chance.

279
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:34,632
We should make bets on what the Yakuza are exporting.

280
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:37,302
Hundred bucks says exotic animals...

281
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,888
or counterfeit purses.

282
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,307
Last time these guys brought something into town,

283
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,227
it was a cargo ship transporting a kid.

284
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,688
- Human trafficking?
- Yeah, something like that.

285
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,780
- Oh...
- Elektra.

286
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,242
All these cars are empty.
This one's full.

287
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,953
So are the others beyond it.

288
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,706
- Full of what?
- I don't know.

289
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,624
There's no negative space.

290
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,168
Cargo is uniform.
There's no real shape.

291
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,545
There's a lot of it, though.

292
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,464
Enough to buckle the tracks.

293
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,176
You're right.
This is ours.

294
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,345
Come on, let's go.
Let's have a look.

295
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,575
- Dirt.
- Do they know we're here?

296
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,745
Is this a decoy?

297
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,791
Wait.

298
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,086
- They're coming.
- Let's go.

299
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,102
You okay?

300
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,605
The best things in life leave you breathless, right?

301
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:40,318
I'm glad you feel that way,
'cause I got something for ya.

302
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,826
It's your lucky day.

303
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,496
Ahh!

304
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,363
What the hell took you so long?

305
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,370
You hurt?

306
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,376
Let me see.

307
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,004
Ow.

308
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,218
Do you think this one will scar?

309
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,220
Don't they all?

310
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,057
I suppose I'll never have short hair again.

311
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:37,227
Well, you could always tell people
you got it fighting the Yakuza.

312
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,522
No one would believe you anyway.

313
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,821
- All right.
- Thank you.

314
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,869
We make a good team, Matthew.

315
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,331
Keep some pressure on it.

316
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,380
What do you tell people?

317
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:07,590
About?

318
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,802
Where you got your scars?

319
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,100
Um...

320
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,186
Lucky me, I wear suits to work, so...

321
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,396
rarely comes up.

322
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,192
What do you tell the women you bring home?

323
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,319
Well, they're enjoying themselves too much.

324
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,404
They don't ask.

325
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,613
Sure.

326
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,410
Oh, hey.

327
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:39,164
- You're bleeding.
- Oh.

328
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,382
- That okay?
- It takes a lot more to hurt me.

329
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,971
You, on the other hand...

330
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:09,068
Oh... I haven't seen this one.

331
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,072
Yeah, the Russians like their knives.

332
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,992
At least, I think it was the Russians.

333
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,995
And these?

334
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,789
The Yakuza.

335
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,043
Actually, a ninja named Nobu.

336
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,131
Nobu Yoshioka?

337
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,840
What, you know him?

338
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,800
By reputation.

339
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:38,014
Yeah, this was him, too.
That hurt.

340
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,893
And the, uh, two on my back.

341
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,984
Wasn't there in college.

342
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,279
Most of them weren't.

343
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,490
You've been busy, huh?

344
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,742
Seems we both have.

345
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,713
Where did you go, Elektra?

346
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,343
The last time we were together...

347
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,767
As far from you as I could.

348
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:28,981
And... did you find whatever...

349
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:32,109
you were looking for?

350
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,906
Mostly I found that I was alone.

351
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,702
Then why didn't you come back?

352
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,997
Because you don't know what I know.

353
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,754
Because you deserve better.

354
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,233
Lie down.
Get some rest.

355
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:34,316
I'm, uh... I'm really late.

356
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,446
I... I will look into the exports,
see where they're coming from.

357
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:41,448
Yeah.

358
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,785
Have a good day in court, Matthew.

359
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,796
Today, of all days...

360
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,799
I mean, he said he'd be late, but this is ridiculous.

361
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,009
Foggy, what is going on with him?

362
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:06,097
All rise.
Court is now in session,

363
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,266
the Honorable Judge Cynthia Batzer presiding.

364
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:16,232
Indictment number 1986-4447,
The People v. Frank Castle.

365
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,775
Be seated.

366
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,406
Looks like you're a man down.

367
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,075
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

368
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,995
the defendant has been indicted
for several serious crimes.

369
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,789
But I'm instructing you, as a point of law...

370
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,833
You know those college stress dreams,

371
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,960
when you show up to your class in your underwear?

372
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,754
- Yeah?
- That's me right now.

373
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,883
God damn, Matt was supposed
to deliver opening, not me.

374
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,802
Ms. Reyes, are the People ready
to begin opening statements?

375
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,262
More than ready, Your Honor.

376
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,515
Should we be worried?

377
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,976
I mean, there's no way Matt misses this, right?

378
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,478
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

379
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:59,025
Frank Castle brutally tortured
and murdered 30 people.

380
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,278
Thirty that we know of.

381
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:06,282
He took the law into his own hands.

382
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:12,038
Acted as judge, jury, and...
most violent executioner.

383
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:17,334
And you will hear that the defendant's
victims were criminals...

384
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,337
but the victims are not on trial here today,

385
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:23,966
and justice does not belong
in the hands of a man like Frank Castle.

386
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,260
This isn't the Wild West.

387
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:30,557
Justice is served here... in a court of law.

388
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,850
And it is up to each of you

389
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:36,604
to take back the city from lawless vigilantes...

390
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:38,731
like Frank Castle.

391
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,449
This man is no hero.

392
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,910
He's a serial killer.

393
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,872
And he is guilty.

394
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,419
Thank you.

395
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:05,758
Mr. Nelson, are you
prepared to make your opening statement?

396
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:08,302
- She's good.
- So are you.

397
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,680
Mr. Nelson?

398
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,811
Mr. Nelson, are you reserving the right
to make your statement at a later time?

399
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,112
Screw it.

400
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,073
Um...

401
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,702
No, Your Honor, um...
the defense is ready to proceed.

402
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,417
Uh, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

403
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:44,756
the defendant, Frank Castle, is not...

404
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,425
Sorry.

405
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,639
Um...

406
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:56,684
Mr. Castle is as much a victim...

407
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,188
No, he's not.

408
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,198
Okay, so...

409
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:14,661
you're 19... standing in hot sand...

410
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,079
sun burning down...

411
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:19,999
noise...

412
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,919
yelling, gunfire...

413
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,463
The only thing that you know for sure

414
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,216
is that you're surrounded
by an enemy that wants you dead.

415
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,638
But you do it.
You endure it.

416
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,347
Why?

417
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:38,601
Because you have orders.
And you have a duty.

418
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,064
And also because your life doesn't end here.

419
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,026
You have people you love waiting at home.

420
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:52,073
Because... aside from being a decorated marine...

421
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:57,411
the man before you is a good husband
and an excellent father.

422
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:02,834
Frank Castle returned from the hell of war

423
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,461
wanting nothing more than to pick up his life.

424
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:11,300
But his wife... young son and daughter

425
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,845
were brutally murdered by criminals,

426
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:17,640
and no one, not the police and...

427
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:21,644
certainly not the District Attorney
stepped up to make it right.

428
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,730
See, Frank Castle never came home.

429
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,858
He just traded in one war zone for another.

430
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,448
This trial isn't about vigilantes.

431
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:37,493
It's about the failure of the justice system.

432
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:40,788
And how one man, Frank Castle,
is being used as a pawn

433
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:43,082
to cover up that system's mistakes.

434
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,835
The prosecution wants blood.

435
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,087
But as the judge just said...

436
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,133
to get it, they have to prove their case
beyond a reasonable doubt.

437
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,177
So all I'm asking of you today...

438
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,680
keep an open mind.

439
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,268
That's all, Your Honor.

440
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:09,316
That was a pretty thick slice
of bullshit there, counselor.

441
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,068
Prosecution, call your first witness.

442
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,153
Yes, Your Honor.

443
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,155
- Sorry, guys.
- Where the hell have you been?

444
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,157
Look, I made a mistake, Karen,
I feel terrible about it,

445
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,700
but, Foggy, I caught some of your opening statement.

446
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:18,993
- You did great.
- He was amazing.

447
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,328
Hey, hey, thanks for keeping us afloat, buddy.

448
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,540
Yeah, well...

449
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:28,044
hopefully Reyes didn't notice
my buckets of flop sweat.

450
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:30,713
And if the DA's office didn't suspect
we had nothing before,

451
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:31,798
they gotta be sure now.

452
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,049
Well, then we'll just have to change that.

453
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,051
Yeah, who's on the prosecution's
witness list for tomorrow?

454
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,594
Uh... I've got it, here.

455
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:43,017
Tepper, wonderful.

456
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,687
Reyes is calling the chief medical examiner.

457
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,271
From rocky start to Hail Mary.

458
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,355
Why, what do we know about him?

459
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:50,733
I showed Frank a copy of his family's autopsy report.

460
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,609
He claims they're faked,
and Tepper's name is all over them.

461
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:53,695
Well, that's great. All right.

462
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,612
- So we should get him on the record.
- That's what we said.

463
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:57,699
Which you would've known
had you shown up to the office at all.

464
00:35:57,782 --> 00:36:00,034
- Let me take lead on it, buddy.
- Like you took the lead this morning?

465
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,869
You've made your point, all right?
Let me try at least.

466
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:02,954
Let me get a crack at this guy.

467
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:05,581
Even if we get the false reports
entered into evidence,

468
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:08,542
and it's a big "if,"
since they concern an unrelated crime,

469
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,295
odds are slim that this clown's
gonna incriminate himself.

470
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,173
Unless two brilliant attorneys
can figure out a way to trip him up.

471
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,802
- Exactly.
- You want it? Knock yourself out.

472
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:21,889
But Tepper ain't talking without a fight.
The DA's pulling his strings.

473
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:24,809
And he's had plenty of time to bulletproof his story.

474
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:28,604
We only have 12 hours to tear it down.
I don't know how we do that by tomorrow.

475
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:32,108
Because Karen's gonna catch me up,
and we're gonna figure out a way.

476
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,778
Fine, but I'm going back to the office,

477
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:38,280
'cause I have the rest of the trial to prep for.

478
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,537
- You let him down, Matt.
- I know. Hey, I know.

479
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,289
But I'm gonna make it up to him.

480
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,653
And I'm gonna make it up to you.

481
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,793
Come on.

482
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,677
You get Tepper thinking about the real report.

483
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:54,171
- Mmm-hmm.
- The real truth.

484
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,091
And then when he's disoriented,
I follow up with something like...

485
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:59,010
"Who had you change the report?"

486
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,594
And even if he says "no one," it proves--

487
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,096
It proves that the report was changed.

488
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,597
- And that's--
- That's brilliant.

489
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,058
- See? You're a natural.
- Huh.

490
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:08,019
Well, I keep good company.

491
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:09,896
Ah, you know what?

492
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,148
Why don't I help you go through
Tepper's bread-crumb questions?

493
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,983
We could, you know, set 'em up, knock 'em down?

494
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,692
All right, but it'll be boring.

495
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,403
And tedious.

496
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:20,322
- Could take all night.
- Hmm.

497
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:22,742
Well, I don't mind.

498
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:24,911
- What?
- You ever consider law school?

499
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:27,789
Oh, I don't know.

500
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:30,249
Well, Foggy and I know
a lot of good people at Columbia.

501
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:34,086
I mean, if it's even something you want.

502
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,175
Just thinking Nelson and Murdock
might be more fun as...

503
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,093
Nelson, Murdock and Page.

504
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:45,848
You're... you're sweet.
Uh...

505
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:50,436
I don't know. I don't know if law school's
really the right fit for me.

506
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,896
Um...

507
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:55,399
I guess there's just something
about the rules and the loopholes.

508
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,903
It just feels like the truth
gets lost a little too often.

509
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,186
Well, not every case will be
The People v. Frank Castle.

510
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,323
Right, right.

511
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:05,617
But, you know, it's not just this case.
It's...

512
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:09,746
Uh...

513
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,042
What is it?

514
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,338
You know, we...

515
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:21,383
You ever...

516
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,553
think back to the night we first met?

517
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:28,349
Yeah, all the time.

518
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,355
While I sat in that police station...

519
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,606
alone.

520
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:39,235
I was afraid of the whole world.

521
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,239
Well, at least, until...

522
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,241
you and Foggy came into my life and...

523
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:50,204
You trusted me.
You gave me hope.

524
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:56,836
And then we came back to your place.

525
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,338
I offered you Thai food.

526
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,590
God...

527
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,261
I remember everything about that night,
'cause it's...

528
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,389
not every day your life is threatened...

529
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,893
then saved by a man in black.

530
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,772
Hey, you...

531
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,942
You believe in what he does?

532
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:23,279
- You know, the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. Um...

533
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,910
I, uh...

534
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:34,373
- What?
- I... believe in the law.

535
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:39,003
- If that's what you're asking.
- Right. No, but... but...

536
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,922
But what about when the law fails?

537
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,765
Like it did with me, like it did with Frank.

538
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,926
You know, what are we supposed to turn to?
What should we...

539
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,511
What should we believe will protect us then?

540
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:53,935
See, you're asking a Catholic lawyer.

541
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,727
- I, uh... Yes.
- What do you...

542
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:58,480
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

543
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,442
Uh, I guess it's just...

544
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:04,278
ever since we took on Frank's case, like...

545
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,362
I keep...

546
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:09,909
I keep asking myself if there's really
a difference between...

547
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,704
between someone who saves lives and...

548
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:17,208
someone who prevents
lives from needing to be saved at all.

549
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,334
Right?

550
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,462
Wait...
Wait a second.

551
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:25,132
Frank Castle should be behind bars.

552
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:27,676
I mean, he deserves a fair trial,
but he's murdered people.

553
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,220
Yeah, right.
Bad people.

554
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:30,721
I mean, like the ones who killed his family

555
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:31,805
or the ones who came after me.

556
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,183
But it's not Frank's decision who lives or dies.

557
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,352
That's up to God...

558
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:39,146
or sometimes a jury.

559
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,065
What happened to Frank's family is a tragedy, Karen,

560
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,566
but it doesn't give him the right to kill--

561
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,651
No. No, no, no. God...
God, no! Not the right, that's...

562
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,403
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm just saying that...

563
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,030
I can understand why Frank... why...

564
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,823
why anyone would seek vengeance
for something after...

565
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,426
- after losing it--
- Whoa, no, no, no.

566
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:53,619
That's not the same.
Vengeance is not justice.

567
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,287
What he's doing is completely wrong.

568
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,371
But, right or wrong, you can't deny that it works.

569
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:02,211
You really believe that?

570
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,963
I don't know. No.

571
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:10,927
Maybe.

572
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,272
- Um...
- No, um...

573
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:23,857
You know, maybe this is a good time
to call it a night.

574
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:27,444
I just think we're both exhausted, and...

575
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,031
- You know, a case this big, let's just...
- Um...

576
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,490
Yes, you're probably right.

577
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,996
I don't know, maybe, uh, after...
after the trial's over.

578
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,415
- Yeah, a real date next time.
- Good.

579
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:43,544
Thanks.

580
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,973
- Uh, good night.
- Good night, Karen.

581
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:00,644
Get some rest.

582
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,328
- How long were you listening?
- I wasn't listening.

583
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:19,038
I didn't hear anything about your work

584
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:22,499
that would make me want
to tie a noose and test it on my neck.

585
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,086
I won't even mention what I didn't hear
about your girlfriend.

586
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:28,339
- I warned you not to interrupt my life.
- This is not your life, Matthew.

587
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,632
You may not give a damn about
what I've made for myself,

588
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:32,509
but that is what's most important to me.

589
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:35,804
All right?
She... is important to me.

590
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:37,764
Right.

591
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,975
Sorry.

592
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:45,231
I didn't know your time pairing wine
with Thai food was so important.

593
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:47,108
What do you want?

594
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:50,986
I looked more carefully at Roxxon's
construction investment.

595
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,697
Seems there's only a small number
of projects in New York

596
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,949
capable of moving that much dirt.

597
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:59,245
We pay the sites a visit,
I bet we find out what they're hiding.

598
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:02,539
- What are these sites?
- Um...

599
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:06,210
The Conservatory Hotel, the Midtown Tunnel project,

600
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:08,712
and some big build site at 44th and 11th.

601
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,797
44th and 11th.

602
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:12,424
- You know it?
- Yeah, Midland Circle.

603
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:14,551
There was a tenement on that block

604
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:18,139
before Wilson Fisk swallowed it up
in his Better Tomorrow initiative.

605
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:20,807
- How did the Japanese get hold of it?
- I don't know.

606
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:24,270
But before I fought Nobu,
I found blueprints at Midland Circle.

607
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:29,065
Now, I always thought Nobu was just
a weapon Fisk sent to take me out,

608
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,402
that Fisk had interests tied up in the building,

609
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:32,903
but maybe he didn't want it at all.

610
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:36,115
I mean, what if he only acquired
Midland Circle for the Japanese?

611
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:38,033
That's a curious riddle,

612
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:39,877
one I think we should go and solve together.

613
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,162
Elektra, I got court in the morning.

614
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:43,872
- I got a case to prepare, I got...
- Tomorrow night, then.

615
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,670
Cheap wine.

616
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:52,256
Finish your homework.
I'll do some recon.

617
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,220
And so, Dr. Tepper, the medical examiner's office

618
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:01,765
can confirm that the 15 victims
found at the Irish Social Club

619
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,434
all died of multiple gunshot wounds.

620
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:05,561
Yes, that's correct.

621
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:11,066
Um, all 15 victims died of wounds
inflicted by the same caliber bullet...

622
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,569
each shot multiple times.

623
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,362
Thank you.

624
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:17,406
Your witness.

625
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,914
- Cross your fingers.
- I'm crossing everything.

626
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,885
Dr. Gregory Tepper,

627
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:41,555
how long have you been medical examiner
for the city of New York?

628
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:44,015
Uh, 14 years, uh, give or take.

629
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,977
And how many death certificates would you
estimate you've signed in that time?

630
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,061
Huh?

631
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,648
Um, I don't, uh...

632
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:52,858
It's probably in the tens of thousands.

633
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,068
Objection, Your Honor, leading the witness...

634
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,529
- I'm not sure where.
- Mr. Murdock--

635
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:59,323
I have something I need to say.

636
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:02,451
- Doctor?
- Your Honor, I'm sorry, but...

637
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,286
I have to, on the record...

638
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:07,539
I need to say something about what I did.

639
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,336
- Clear the gallery.
- Yes, Your Honor.

640
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:16,214
All jury members,
please exit back to the deliberation room.

641
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,342
Everyone in the gallery,

642
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:21,595
please make your way
out of the courtroom at this time.

643
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,018
What's all this about?

644
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:30,437
I...

645
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:34,608
I know what the defense was gonna
ask me about, and it's true.

646
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,568
I altered the autopsy reports.

647
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:38,452
Uh, you're referring to the official findings

648
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:40,129
on the murders of Frank Castle's family?

649
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,073
Not just them.

650
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,242
You don't understand.
I had to do it.

651
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:48,372
- Those animals came to my office.
- Who came to your office?

652
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,916
After the defendant's family was murdered,

653
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:52,918
two men I'd never seen before...

654
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:56,087
they warned me, if I didn't fix the case reports,

655
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:58,590
they'd come after my family next.

656
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:02,260
You falsified the autopsy
findings on the Castle family?

657
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:04,805
Them and one more.

658
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,723
- Who?
- I don't know.

659
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,809
Some John Doe killed the same day.

660
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:11,186
Male, adult, multiple gunshot wounds.

661
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,523
Look, you can fire me, arrest me...
I don't care.

662
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:18,109
I thought this was behind me, but after last night...

663
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,612
Doctor, did something happen last night
to impact your testimony?

664
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:23,031
She was in my house.

665
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,366
She tied me up.

666
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:28,954
She said she didn't give a damn who got to me before.

667
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,665
If I didn't tell the defense what really happened,

668
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,334
she'd hunt me down and kill me.

669
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:35,419
- Who told you this?
- I don't know.

670
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,379
A woman.

671
00:46:37,463 --> 00:46:40,424
Her face was covered.
Had some foreign accent.

672
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,385
Your Honor, I believe the defense
intends to distract the jury

673
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:46,972
and make this case about some
impossible-to-prove conspiracy theories--

674
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,056
Impossible to prove?

675
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,351
Your ME just confirmed
that he doctored the autopsy records.

676
00:46:50,434 --> 00:46:52,185
He also said that he'd been threatened.

677
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:55,271
If my office finds out that your firm
had anything to do with this--

678
00:46:55,356 --> 00:46:58,359
Our firm? For all we know,
it was you who sent those goons.

679
00:46:58,442 --> 00:46:59,568
I've heard enough.

680
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:03,405
It's clear to me that whatever Dr. Tepper
may know about these autopsy reports

681
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:04,906
has been tainted

682
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,118
by threats made by person or persons unknown.

683
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,828
Then the defense asks for a mistrial.

684
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:13,039
Not on your life, Mr. Nelson.
I'm still not convinced these documents,

685
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:15,709
whatever they may be,
are even relevant to this trial.

686
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:18,837
I'm striking the doctor's entire testimony

687
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,757
and instructing the jurors to disregard
anything they may have heard.

688
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,520
- Your Honor, I strongly urge you to--
- We're done here, counselor.

689
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:27,638
Trial will reconvene tomorrow
with the prosecution's next witness.

690
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,266
Once again, Reyes finds a new way to screw us.

691
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,669
You'd think it'd get easier,
but somehow it's more painful.

692
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:36,438
Foggy. Foggy... it wasn't Reyes.

693
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:39,900
- What?
- The woman who threatened Tepper.

694
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:42,778
It was Elektra.

695
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,072
From college.

696
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:48,324
- Elektra?
- Yeah, she's back in town.

697
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,286
- Your ex-girlfriend?
- Yes.

698
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,122
No.
This is insane.

699
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,459
She's a diplomat's daughter, a... a debutante.

700
00:47:57,543 --> 00:47:59,961
Not anymore.
She's, uh...

701
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,590
She's... she's different.
She's... she's dangerous.

702
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:06,134
Yeah, no shit.
She nearly got you expelled.

703
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,471
I mean, she screwed your semester
of torts, civil procedure...

704
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:12,265
You almost missed the final
because she hurt you so bad.

705
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,391
And now, what?

706
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:15,894
- She's... breaking into an ME's house?
- Okay.

707
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,771
So, the Yakuza didn't go away, all right?

708
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:18,897
They're still here in Hell's Kitchen.

709
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,357
Elektra is trying to help me stop them,
infiltrating--

710
00:48:21,442 --> 00:48:22,818
What are you even talking about?

711
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,653
She was going up against them by herself, and she--

712
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:27,176
- Your ex-girlfriend?
- Yeah, I'm trying to protect the city--

713
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:31,284
I knew she was crazy,
I didn't know that she was homicidal.

714
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,244
She's, um...

715
00:48:34,538 --> 00:48:35,997
my new client.

716
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,876
Foggy, the, uh... rich one.

717
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,211
The private one.

718
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,049
- You lied again.
- I did, I lied,

719
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,884
but, look, the Yakuza are funneling
money into something

720
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:49,511
even bigger and darker than before, all right?

721
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:51,137
Elektra came to me, I'm trying to help her--

722
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:53,807
You wanted to take this trial!

723
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,226
You missed strategy sessions...

724
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:59,771
witness prep, opening statements,
and you criminally decimate--

725
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:00,856
No, I didn't. She...

726
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:02,774
I never told her anything about the trial, all right?

727
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:05,611
The one witness that could've helped us
do what I wanted to do,

728
00:49:05,694 --> 00:49:06,695
which is take down Reyes!

729
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:09,322
She must've overheard me talking to Karen,
and then she moved on her own.

730
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,949
I would... I didn't sanction, I would never--

731
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,744
- I don't care! I don't care, Matt!
- I'm furious with her!

732
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:16,037
Stop acting like these things just happen to you!

733
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,832
No one's making you go out all hours
of the night fighting bad guys

734
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:22,919
and nobody makes you lie to your friends,
over and over again!

735
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:26,840
Elektra is not the problem, Matt.

736
00:49:29,593 --> 00:49:30,677
You are.

737
00:49:33,514 --> 00:49:34,598
It's almost dark.

738
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,892
- I'm sure there's someplace you gotta be--
- You're not walking away.

739
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:38,685
- No, 'cause you know what?
- Don't walk away from me, Foggy.

740
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:42,438
If the last few days are any indication,
you sure as hell haven't been here!

741
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,612
Going forward, I will count on you
for nothing at all.

742
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,160
Tell your girlfriend to stay away from my trial.

743
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,083
Yeah, she's not...
Elektra's not my girlfriend.

744
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,414
Then you should be the one to tell Karen about her.

745
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:04,502
Hey.

746
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:07,548
- Hey, I heard yelling.
- Yeah, you should talk to Matt about it.

747
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:08,632
Foggy!

748
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,886
- Hey, what the hell happened in there?
- We're fine.

749
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,055
No, no, no, you don't treat me
like I'm just your secretary.

750
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:16,389
I've done more work on this case than you have!

751
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,309
- I can't get into this right now, Karen.
- No, enough of the dodgy bullshit.

752
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,936
I deserve to know what is going on with you two.

753
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,020
With you.

754
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:25,481
You asking as my co-worker?

755
00:50:25,566 --> 00:50:28,401
Or my girlfriend?

756
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:31,071
- Both.
- Yeah.

757
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,530
I am sorry you're caught in the middle of this,

758
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:34,449
but right now, I have to go.

759
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:37,160
- Where?
- I'll see you tomorrow, Karen.

760
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:42,040
Yeah, maybe.

761
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:02,143
What the hell did you do?
I told you to stay out of my life.

762
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:04,270
I never asked you to coerce a witness!

763
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:06,522
- You had a problem, so I stepped in.
- No! It doesn't help.

764
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:09,234
We can't even use his testimony
because of you. It was all thrown out.

765
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,194
I was only following your rules.

766
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:14,865
- What rules?
- You don't get what you want by day.

767
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:17,868
You take it by force at night.

768
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:19,995
This is who you are, Matthew.

769
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,082
And don't fool yourself into thinking
it's anything else.

770
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:26,209
What I do...

771
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,919
is none of your business.

772
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:32,090
- Both halves of my life are mine.
- Fine.

773
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:36,094
I'll stay out of your boring legal shit.

774
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:39,890
Now, you wanna fight me?

775
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:42,893
Or you wanna fight the guys
who are tearing your city apart?

776
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,673
- You didn't wanna help?
- You didn't want me to.

777
00:52:58,176 --> 00:52:59,177
Ready?

778
00:53:09,855 --> 00:53:11,022
You hear something?

779
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:15,568
We're alone.

780
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:42,637
It's empty.
There's nothing in here.

781
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,349
- The Yakuza were guarding something.
- Yeah, but...

782
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:54,607
Shh!

783
00:53:55,525 --> 00:53:57,778
- Elektra.
- What?

784
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:02,407
You're not gonna believe this.

785
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:18,048
Holy shit.

786
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:25,096
Why are the Yakuza digging a hole?

787
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,059
Give me the flashlight.

788
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:43,865
- Did it hit the bottom?
- No.

789
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:47,202
Tell me when it does.
