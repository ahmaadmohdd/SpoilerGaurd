1
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,619
Stay down, Matty.
Don't get up.

2
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,230
You need rest.

3
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,619
No, no!

4
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,400
Morning, sunshine.

5
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,578
Someone better be getting my car.

6
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,581
Bundy's five minutes out.

7
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,055
Keep the press out of here.

8
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:25,141
No statements or photos
until we get this place spotless.

9
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,851
- We control the narrative.
- Of course.

10
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:29,771
And before you leave, Mr. Nelson
and Miss Page wanted a word.

11
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,730
Ugh. Just one?
Can I get that in writing?

12
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,108
Oh, because written agreements
suddenly mean something to you?

13
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:36,360
You wanted your client in witness protection, right?

14
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,905
My offer's still valid for 23 minutes.

15
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,490
- Grotto's gone.
- Too bad.

16
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,702
You used our client for bait!

17
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,537
That's a pretty big allegation--

18
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,914
Allegation?

19
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,833
Look around! This was a shit show!
He could have died.

20
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,250
Let's be real honest here.

21
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,086
No bullshit.

22
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,587
Your firm is small-time.

23
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,214
Your 15 minutes were up after Union Allied.

24
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,133
Right now, you are way out of your league.

25
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,218
Won't take much to sell

26
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,053
that you're the ones that compromised this operation.

27
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,430
- What?
- Say that story goes public.

28
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,725
The story that your incompetence
endangered the life of your client,

29
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,854
neighborhood civilians,
and the brave officers of the NYPD.

30
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,730
You are saying that you would blame us for this?

31
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,315
I never said that.
Did I say that?

32
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,691
I didn't hear it.

33
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,818
Stay away from this case.

34
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:23,199
Nothing? Hmm?
Not even a little support?

35
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,995
All the legal kung fu in the world
wouldn't have won that fight.

36
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,163
Her office could bury us.

37
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,367
We shouldn't have pushed it.

38
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,500
Yeah, well, you didn't push anything.

39
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,710
I know how these assholes operate.

40
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,670
We have to play it their way.
Just for now.

41
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,882
But then what next?

42
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,926
All right, Matt promised Grotto
we would protect him, so did I!

43
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,636
I'm gonna call Matt now.

44
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,680
Let's see if he's...
recuperated enough to help us out.

45
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,350
All right, I'm gonna go back to the office.

46
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,186
I'm gonna see if I can find a way
that Reyes doesn't skin us alive.

47
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,038
They say you don't hear the bullet that gets you.

48
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,542
Always thought that sounded like
a bunch of bullshit to me.

49
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:20,464
How about you, Red?

50
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,634
When I cracked off your forehead the other night...

51
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,554
did you hear that?

52
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,028
Ahh!

53
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,534
You can bash against your chains all night.

54
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,162
Only way you get out of here,

55
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,581
only way you walk free, is if I want you to.

56
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,124
Know that.

57
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,588
Why didn't you take my mask off?

58
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,217
Don't give a shit about who you are.

59
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,262
You killed everyone else.

60
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:12,641
Why am I still alive?

61
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,064
Huh?

62
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,691
I got in your way twice now...

63
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,321
and you don't strike me as someone
who just lets that happen.

64
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,593
Military grade hardware.

65
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,221
You seem to know your way around it.

66
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,560
And you sure carry yourself like a soldier.

67
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,447
What are you gonna do with all this?

68
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,242
I'll do what's required.

69
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,788
Yeah.

70
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,248
We've been waiting six hours!

71
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,292
- Come on, lady.
- Come on!

72
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,876
Claire, damn it, pick up.

73
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,545
If you get this, I'm in the ER.

74
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,213
We need to talk.

75
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:26,340
Holy shit.

76
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,259
Why don't you stop hasslin' me

77
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,262
and go after the psycho who blew away my crew!

78
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,264
That's him!
That's the guy!

79
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,103
Excuse me, I'm looking for a nurse named Claire?

80
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:41,827
- I believe she works the night shift.
- If she's here, she's busy.

81
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,982
Could you just point me in the right direction?

82
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,151
- Are you injured?
- No.

83
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,652
Do you wanna be?

84
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,822
Mr. Carver? We can see you now.

85
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,034
Why you telling me to wait?

86
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,036
You've been telling me this for like an hour already.

87
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:58,914
Hey, get your hands off me!
I didn't say nothin'. Come on!

88
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,001
Oh, man, that's our boy.
He got jumped.

89
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,300
I know your cousin.
I know where you live.

90
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,509
No, he's no good.

91
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm sittin', man, all right?
I'm not startin' nothin'.

92
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,597
Just relax, all right?

93
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,765
- That's what you tell me?
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

94
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:19,352
- Quiet! Sit down!
- Yeah? We're not startin' nothin', man!

95
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:22,313
- He's the one that started it, all right?
- You keep it up, you're out of here.

96
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,066
You're a dead man, you understand?
As soon as you get out.

97
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,984
Hey, listen up.

98
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,195
Police are waiting to take you into custody.

99
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,323
The last thing I need is for you
to come back here in two weeks,

100
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,449
asking what happened,

101
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,494
and blaming one of our people for your mistakes.

102
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,329
Hey, so let me put this simply.

103
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,124
Yesterday, you had five fingers.

104
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,501
But tonight, you got loaded and decided
to hit up a rival clubhouse.

105
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,918
So now you have two.

106
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,629
We're at war, lady.

107
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,172
Listen to me.

108
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:50,466
Had five.
Now two.

109
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,926
Your fault.
That clear?

110
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:56,472
Good.

111
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,475
The meds should kick in soon.

112
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,812
Claire.

113
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,857
Foggy Nelson.
We have a mutual friend.

114
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,066
Remember me?

115
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,236
Shit.

116
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,005
- Nelson and Murdock, may I help you?
- What the hell was that?

117
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,049
Grotto?

118
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,218
Grotto, where are you?

119
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,345
Like I'd tell you shit after what went down.

120
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,473
- Are you hurt?
- Forget all that.

121
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:41,767
You gonna help me out or not?

122
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,394
- Uh, yeah, uh, we'll try--
- Try?

123
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,064
Look, you have to believe me,
we had no idea what Reyes was planning--

124
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,483
Shut up! Shut up!
Goddamn lawyers, you're all alike.

125
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,444
Runnin' your mouths, all that fancy talk...

126
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,404
All the time you're just stickin' it to guys like me.

127
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,113
- Grotto--
- You made promises, lady!

128
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:56,615
You broke every one of 'em.

129
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:57,783
I know.

130
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,035
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,289
Listen, Grotto, the police are coming after you.

132
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,373
You have to come in.

133
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,750
All that shootin', it was...
it was 'cause of him, wasn't it?

134
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,252
The psycho from the hospital?

135
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:10,379
- Yeah.
- Shit.

136
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,089
Shit. He's never gonna stop.

137
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,967
Look, the DA knows she screwed up.

138
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,720
We can go back to her.
We can lock in witness protection--

139
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,163
I'm done makin' deals, sweetheart.

140
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,139
I've got my own plan now,

141
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,892
gettin' outta this hellhole
while I'm still breathin'.

142
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:26,520
You tell that donut of a lawyer and the blind man,

143
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:27,896
they can kiss my ass.

144
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,147
Grotto, please--

145
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:30,941
You can go to hell.

146
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,014
This another one of your missions?

147
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,143
That's why we're here, isn't it?

148
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:11,357
How many will this make?

149
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,820
I'm guessing you've done this, what...

150
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,072
ten, maybe 20 times?

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,669
How long's it been?

152
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,131
Six months, a year...

153
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,883
or your whole life?

154
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,681
Something tells me you don't take breaks.

155
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,395
You know, no one else has to die.

156
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,815
You could stop now.

157
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,025
Walk away.

158
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,239
Walk away?

159
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,867
Could you do that?

160
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,036
Could you walk away?

161
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,291
Yeah.

162
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,012
What is that, midnight?

163
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,807
St. Matthew's.

164
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,769
You a Catholic?

165
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:33,939
Once.

166
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,317
From New York?

167
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,278
Once.

168
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,199
You still go to Mass?

169
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,827
Stop now, Red.

170
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,287
- Stop?
- Stop digging.

171
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:50,581
Ah.

172
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:00,383
You know, a funny thing about New York...

173
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,761
few people are actually from here.

174
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,514
The ones who are...

175
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,307
they don't leave.
They can't, they, uh...

176
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:11,560
They feel like the city's a part of them.

177
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,604
You know?

178
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,443
Until one day, something changes.
Maybe they get older.

179
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,072
And then they have to leave, they have to get out.

180
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:25,949
See the world, maybe.

181
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:28,952
Maybe they enlist?

182
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,707
Where'd they send you?

183
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,752
You a shrink, Red?

184
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,592
Now, come on, you must be something when
you're not wearing the long johns, right?

185
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,804
- I'm just a guy.
- Yeah?

186
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,015
You ever been to war?

187
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,643
No.

188
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,396
Yeah... then don't talk about it.

189
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,982
I've seen some fights.

190
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,401
Sure you have.

191
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,945
Well, I almost had you beat.

192
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,282
You talk about trading hands on a rooftop, Red.

193
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,036
I'm talking about shit, okay?

194
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,747
Shit that you ain't been in.

195
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,583
- I know one thing.
- What's that?

196
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,292
War changes people.

197
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,547
Sometimes they see things they can't unsee.

198
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,717
Come home to find home's not there anymore.

199
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,802
It changed.

200
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:27,970
Or maybe they did.

201
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,138
Yeah, fair enough.

202
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,782
I'm just saying, I know it can be hard.

203
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,560
Do you?

204
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,353
You know it can be hard?

205
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,522
You run around this city

206
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,941
in a pair of little boy's pajamas and a mask.

207
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:46,363
You go home at night, right?
Take that mask off, maybe you think...

208
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:49,742
it wasn't you who did those things,
maybe it was somebody else.

209
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,495
Well, see, soldiers...

210
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,622
we don't wear masks, yeah?

211
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,457
We don't get that privilege.

212
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,964
- You know what I think?
- What's that?

213
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,884
- You're still at war.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

214
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,969
So, you charge by the hour, doc, or what?

215
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,225
Why am I here?

216
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,353
Everything you do out there
in the streets, Red, it doesn't work.

217
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,981
- Did you know that?
- Oh, and what you're doing is better?

218
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,651
What I do, I just do.
It's out of necessity.

219
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,611
Come on.

220
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,488
You know you're not the only one, right?

221
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,616
Who did you lose? Huh?

222
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,409
Was it someone you loved?

223
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,286
Well, boo-hoo.
Let me tell you something, buddy.

224
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,497
Everybody's lost someone.
Doesn't mean you have to do this.

225
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,874
Well, loss doesn't work the same for everybody, Red.

226
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,959
Yeah, that's right.
It's clearly not working for you.

227
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,503
Maybe not.

228
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,297
We don't get to pick the things that fix us, Red.

229
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,090
Make us whole.

230
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,552
Make us feel purpose.

231
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:53,388
My moment of clarity?
It came from the strangest of places.

232
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:58,018
What kind of name is
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen, anyway?

233
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,394
I mean, really?

234
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,356
I didn't ask for that name.

235
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,160
I'm sorry, I don't see you running from it.

236
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,359
I don't do this to hurt people.

237
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,963
- Yeah, so what is that, just a job perk?
- I don't kill anyone.

238
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,789
Is that why you think you're better than me?

239
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,241
- No.
- Is that why you think you're a big hero?

240
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,911
It doesn't matter what I think or what I am.

241
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,204
People don't have to die.

242
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,664
Come on, Red.
You believe that?

243
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,867
I believe it's not my call,
and it ain't yours either.

244
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,753
Somebody ask you to put on that costume
or you take it upon yourself?

245
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,923
You know what I think of you, hero?

246
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,093
I think you're a half-measure.

247
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,596
I think you're a man who can't finish the job.

248
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,305
I think that you're a coward.

249
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,560
You know the one thing that you just can't see?

250
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,520
You know you're one bad day away from being me.

251
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,942
Yeah.

252
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,070
Someone's coming.

253
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,155
Shit.

254
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,742
- Guess I'd better make a run for it.
- Hey, don't hurt him.

255
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,994
Yeah? Let's hope he doesn't give me a reason to.

256
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,579
What's all that noise?

257
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:02,332
If it's you damned kids again,
I swear I'm callin' the cops!

258
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,251
I'll say this once, Red.

259
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,418
You make one sound,

260
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,713
and I'll open his head up all over this roof.

261
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:09,965
Hello?

262
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,224
This is really not a good time.

263
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,976
- What's going on in here?
- You tell me.

264
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,604
- I have patients stacked up in four halls.
- Look, I get it.

265
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,188
You're up to your eyeballs.

266
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,314
But I got a problem too,

267
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,859
and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
good and goddamn urgent.

268
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,069
I'm looking for a certain mutual friend of ours.

269
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,696
Ouch! Careful, bitch.

270
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,159
I haven't seen him.
I've been on ER duty all month.

271
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:40,704
No breaks. I haven't been able
to walk outside of these walls lately.

272
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,414
Sounds like you pissed somebody off.

273
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,457
Yeah, I'm getting really good at that.

274
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,335
You rip that, you're gonna have
to re-stitch it yourself.

275
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,754
So he hasn't been here?

276
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,714
He have a reason to be?

277
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,050
Well, you know, our friend is fond of extreme sports.

278
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,929
You can cut the shit.
I know who you're talking about.

279
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,556
I thought maybe he came to you for help again.

280
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,058
The last time he came to me for help,

281
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,936
I wound up elbow deep in our mutual friend's blood.

282
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,146
I'm never doing that again.

283
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,816
Well, maybe you can help me check records.

284
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,984
See if he's come in anywhere else.

285
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,319
Look...

286
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,822
I know why you're worried.

287
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,450
He's been building himself quite the rep lately.

288
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,202
Is this something I want to hear?

289
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,370
Yo, lady, where the hell am I supposed to go now?

290
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,373
You want the ER perspective?

291
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,875
Victims love him.

292
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,711
Victimizers?

293
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,587
Want him more dead than ever.

294
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,925
Look, if you're gonna follow me around...

295
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,302
at least make yourself useful.

296
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,972
Here...

297
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,655
look around the other side of the table.

298
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,226
I'm not sure I'm qualified for this.

299
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,603
You're breathing, you're not in cuffs,
you're on the team.

300
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,063
Spray when I say.

301
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,398
Look, I care about our friend.

302
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,193
I believe in what he's doing,
I believe the city needs him.

303
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,154
But the truth is, I can't help anymore.

304
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,490
I've got this shift from hell

305
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,159
'cause I helped another friend trying to do good.

306
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,161
Big guy.

307
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,788
Stronger than our friend.

308
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,166
And yet I'm the one who got the shaft.

309
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,545
I'm just trying to keep my head down, do my job...

310
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,257
stay sane.
Spray.

311
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,511
Trust me, I don't like being
a part of this any more than you do.

312
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,805
But I need to find him.

313
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,598
I'd do it myself, but I'm out of ideas.

314
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,518
Listen, as close as he gets, Matt's...

315
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,103
pretty good at not getting himself killed.

316
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,647
I'm not so sure about that anymore.

317
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,358
Easy, dumb-ass.
My leg is killing me.

318
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,737
So, you've probably been
pulling in lots of DOAs lately.

319
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,905
Criminal types?

320
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,032
There's been a serious uptick in gunshot wounds,

321
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,992
now that you mention it.

322
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,952
Something's really got the gangs riled.

323
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,996
It's a "someone."

324
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,041
And the freak responsible
is the one Matt's up against.

325
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,044
I'll be out of your hair
before you know it, but, please...

326
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,462
he's my best friend.

327
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,089
I just need to make sure he's okay.

328
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:00,260
- You son of a bitch!
- See what you got, punk! Come on!

329
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,179
Come on, get over here!

330
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,807
- I'll crack your stupid head open!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

331
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,017
- Somebody call security.
- Calm down!

332
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,357
Who the hell are you?

333
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,235
Frank.

334
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,779
What are you doing up here, Frank?

335
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,533
Well, the truth is, um,
I'm pretty sure that this here roof,

336
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,285
right here, this is the, uh...

337
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,872
this is the last patch of real estate
in the entire goddamn United States

338
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,541
where a man can just have a little peace,
be by himself, and...

339
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,543
have a smoke.

340
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,839
Never seen you around.

341
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:40,258
Yeah, no. I'm, uh, in town
just visiting my crazy sister.

342
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,845
Betty in 2B?

343
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,138
I see you've had the pleasure.

344
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,349
- Can't say I blame you.
- Nah.

345
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,642
My wife's the same.
Made me quit a long time ago.

346
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,061
You know what they say.

347
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,354
It's for our health.

348
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,981
What about the enjoyment of life?

349
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,108
Guess they'll worry about that when they're dead.

350
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,198
What was that?

351
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,284
Uh, it's just... just a rat.

352
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,371
We exterminated.

353
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:13,291
Lot of guys... they half-ass it.

354
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,254
Remember my uncle used to tell me
that all the time. He fumigated.

355
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,338
Hard work.

356
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,883
Yeah, well.
It's all he could get after the war.

357
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,384
You know, curse of a soldier.

358
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,635
Ain't that the truth.

359
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,845
Yeah. You serve?

360
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,931
'Nam, 3rd Marine Division.

361
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,724
Fighting 3rd, huh?

362
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,809
Goddamn right. You?

363
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,811
Yeah, yeah.
Iraq, Afghanistan.

364
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,815
Welcome home.

365
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,234
Thank you, sir.

366
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,071
I gotta go down right now, but, you...

367
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,823
you smoke as much as you like, son.

368
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,743
- Thank you, sir. All right.
- All right, son.

369
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,043
- Hey, Marine!
- Yeah?

370
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,377
Semper Fi.

371
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,354
Frank.

372
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,232
That's your real name?

373
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,321
- You get off threatening innocent people?
- He was only in danger

374
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,905
because you squealed,
because you can't follow orders--

375
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,740
You had a gun on him.
You thumbed back the hammer.

376
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,664
Yeah, well, that was for you.
Part of the show.

377
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,496
What does that mean?

378
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,416
I really have to spell it out for you, Red? Huh?

379
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,502
I'm disappointed.
Listen carefully, okay?

380
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,213
You listening? Yeah? How 'bout now?

381
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,965
You listening?
Feel it?

382
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,635
I'm not a bad guy, Red.

383
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,431
You wanna explain that to the orphans and
the widows of the men you killed?

384
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,350
For Christ's sake, that's what you think?

385
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,478
I'm just some crazy asshole going around
unloading on whoever I want to?

386
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,021
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.

387
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,564
- That it?
- You think you're anything else?

388
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,317
I think that the people I kill
need killing, that's what I think.

389
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,611
You left men hanging from meat hooks!

390
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:06,154
They got off easy, in my opinion.

391
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,780
You shot up a hospital.

392
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,574
Yeah, and nobody got hurt who didn't deserve it.

393
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,618
Oh, yeah.
What about you, Frank?

394
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:14,287
What happens the day someone decides you deserve it?

395
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,456
I'll tell you what, they better not miss.

396
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,834
Come on, you run around this city
like it's your damn shooting gallery.

397
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,420
- You think you do--
- Yeah, what do you do? What do you do?

398
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:25,173
You act like it's a playground.
You beat up the bullies with your fists.

399
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:28,260
You throw 'em in jail,
everybody calls you a hero, right?

400
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,053
And then a month, a week, a day later,

401
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,264
they're back on the streets
doing the same goddamn thing--

402
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,391
Yeah, so you just put 'em in the morgue.

403
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,101
You're goddamn right, I do.

404
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,311
- You ever doubt yourself, Frank?
- Not even for a second.

405
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:41,148
Really? Really?
You never think for one second,

406
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,691
"Shit, I just killed a human being."

407
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:44,859
That's being pretty generous.

408
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:48,030
A human being who did
a lot of stupid shit, maybe even evil,

409
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,282
but had one small piece of goodness in him.

410
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,159
Maybe just a scrap, Frank, but something.

411
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,037
And then you come along,
and that one tiny flicker of light

412
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,163
gets snuffed out forever.

413
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,044
I think you're wrong.

414
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,753
- Which part?
- All of it.

415
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,381
I think there's no good in the filth
that I put down, that's what I think.

416
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,550
- And how do you know?
- I just know.

417
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:11,178
Look around, Red.
This city, it stinks. It's a sewer.

418
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:14,347
It stinks and it smells like shit
and I can't get the stink out of my nose.

419
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:17,975
I think that this world, it needs men
that are willing to make the hard call.

420
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,853
- I think you and me are the same!
- That's bullshit, Frank, and you know it!

421
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,647
Only I do the one thing that you can't.

422
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,982
You hit 'em, and they get back up.
I hit 'em, and they stay down.

423
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,153
It's permanent. I make sure that they
don't make it out on the street again.

424
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,237
I take pride in that.

425
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,363
- Let me ask you this.
- What's that?

426
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,607
- What about hope?
- Oh, fuck.

427
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:32,990
- Come on, Frank--
- You wanna talk about Santa Claus?

428
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:34,076
You wanna talk about Santa Claus?

429
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,618
I live in the real world too, and I've seen it.

430
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,287
- Yeah? What have you seen?
- Redemption, Frank.

431
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,955
- Ah, Jesus Christ.
- It's real. And it's possible.

432
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,838
The people you murder deserve another chance.

433
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,584
What, to kill again? Rape again?
Is that what you want?

434
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,044
No, Frank.
To try again, Frank.

435
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,754
To try.

436
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:47,922
And if you don't get that,

437
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,805
there's something broken in you you can't fix,

438
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,134
and you really are a nutjob.

439
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,679
What did you say?

440
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,681
You're...

441
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,392
You're unhinged... Frank.

442
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,060
You are.

443
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:04,189
You think God made you a one-man firing squad.

444
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,357
But you're wrong.

445
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,360
There is goodness in people, even in you.

446
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,486
And you're gonna have to kill me,

447
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,028
'cause I'm never gonna stop coming for you,

448
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:12,947
until I take you down.

449
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,390
- You wanna know why?
- Why's that?

450
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,660
- Because you're insane.
- Hmm.

451
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,260
Late night?

452
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,345
What are you doing here?

453
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:38,348
Protecting our client, who is still out there, alone.

454
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,893
You're talking about him like he's a... a lost puppy.

455
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,979
Mr. Grote is a convicted criminal
and lucky we gave him the time of day.

456
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,564
I'd forget about him if I were you.

457
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,815
We promised to protect him.

458
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:49,526
Maybe you shouldn't have.

459
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,115
Your boss said she could take down
a firm like ours pretty quickly.

460
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,200
She wasn't lying.

461
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,493
Huh...

462
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:01,954
So, she could also take down someone like you?

463
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,377
ADA Elliot James.

464
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,629
Took the fall after Reyes mishandled informants

465
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:12,048
in the, uh, Teller case about a year ago.

466
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,466
Nicole Kent got booted

467
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,511
from your office after she failed
to quiet the EnSynth scandal.

468
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,639
Chris Davidson...

469
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,723
did you ever meet him?

470
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:25,353
Fired after the State Supreme Court
disqualified your entire office

471
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:29,274
from the Pell case due to "widespread misconduct."

472
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,776
"Widespread."

473
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:34,987
But not everyone got fired.

474
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,365
See, Reyes walked out in one piece.

475
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,035
She's good at throwing people to the wolves.

476
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,831
So, sure, she can take down
Nelson and Murdock this month,

477
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,165
but how long

478
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:49,377
before you are getting
pulled into the shit with the rest of us?

479
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,922
You trying to scare me?

480
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,883
I am here to show you that you and Reyes

481
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,552
are not on the same team.

482
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,663
Where would you even find this shit?

483
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,228
I want protection for Nelson and Murdock.

484
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:08,646
We're small.

485
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,357
We can't survive getting thrown to the wolves.

486
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,066
Not without your help.

487
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:15,683
After what happened today,
someone's gonna crash and burn

488
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:18,406
and I need to know that that won't be us.

489
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,077
What makes you think I can help you,
even if I wanted to?

490
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,665
- You have information on the Punisher.
- That's classified.

491
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,751
Do I look like I'm gonna post it on YouTube?

492
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,004
Your boss is threatening to disbar my friends

493
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,714
and dismantle our law firm.

494
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,592
Yeah, my boss is a piece of work.

495
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,930
Look, how will the Punisher files,
assuming they even exist,

496
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,516
help you stop that from happening?

497
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:50,438
I'll let you know.

498
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:51,898
Unbelievable.

499
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:57,111
So, you expect me to implicate the DA on purpose?

500
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,948
Listen very carefully.

501
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,245
You cannot come into my office,
asking me to betray my boss,

502
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:09,499
throwing around allegations about
this department you cannot substantiate.

503
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,960
So I'm going downstairs to get security.

504
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,384
And you will not contact me again.

505
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,011
No emails. No phone calls. Nothing.

506
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,602
Good night, Miss Page.

507
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,158
- You're dead!
- Go to hell!

508
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,869
They found Freddie Bones with ten slugs to his chest!

509
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,204
That wasn't us, prick.

510
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,416
- This happen often?
- It's been a bad week.

511
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:54,210
Shit.

512
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:57,964
- Put it down! Put it down!
- Back off!

513
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,256
There's innocent people here!

514
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,550
This ain't got nothin' to do with you.

515
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,344
You're gonna hurt somebody.

516
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:05,513
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Put it down, now!

517
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,434
Hey, asshole.
How many priors you got?

518
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:10,602
What'd you say to me?

519
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,228
I asked you about your priors.

520
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,981
Yeah, keep talking shit.
I'll check you into ICU myself.

521
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,858
You got face tattoos, friend.

522
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:19,902
That's like telegraphing,
"I know what prison meatloaf tastes like."

523
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,613
You just better step back, now.

524
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,408
I'm not gonna ask if you know what happens
when you get charged with assault.

525
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:28,745
I got a hunch you got more mug shots
than baby pictures back home.

526
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,037
Man, who are you?

527
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:33,124
I'm the pro-bono suit you'll try to retain
after you go down for this.

528
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,960
Only not even my soft-hearted partner
will take your case,

529
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,505
or any other self-respecting
attorney in Hell's Kitchen.

530
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,715
Not because you're so badass,

531
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,050
but because you're just that stupid.

532
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:45,052
You got a big mouth, asshole.

533
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,514
You forget, I do this for a living.

534
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:51,308
I could ask you to look at the faces
of the other patients.

535
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,310
Every last one of 'em scared to death,

536
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:55,980
because the two of you can't keep it in your pants.

537
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,824
But I'm guessing that neither one of you
could give a collective shit.

538
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,489
So I'm gonna do what attorneys do best
and appeal to your selfish natures.

539
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:07,450
Simply put, if you carve each other up now,

540
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:11,078
in front of these witnesses, with cops right outside,

541
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,872
you're screwed!

542
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,290
I can't just walk away, man.

543
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:18,169
I'm not asking you to lose
the oh-so-serious stink-eye.

544
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,005
Just don't fight!

545
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,677
Put 'em down.

546
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,845
Let these people do their jobs.

547
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,141
Come on.

548
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,493
You all right?

549
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,369
Son of a bitch.

550
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:08,135
.357, one round in the chamber.

551
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,389
Some things, they just...

552
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,308
They feel right in your hand, huh?

553
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,854
I know what you're thinking, Red.

554
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,657
You could put a round in my arm, in my leg,

555
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:22,024
but it's not gonna work, 'cause I'm all geared up.

556
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:24,486
Only way you stop me is with a head shot.

557
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,946
- I'm not gonna shoot you.
- Nope.

558
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:28,865
Not yet, you're not.

559
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:37,164
Time to put a face to all your fancy talk
about redemption.

560
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:41,127
Elliot Grote, a.k.a. Grotto.

561
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,545
I don't wanna die.

562
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:43,963
What did you do to him?

563
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,566
I caught this piece of shit
stealing a car, trying to skip town.

564
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,468
I was scared.
I'm sorry, I was running for my life.

565
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,802
- Shut up.
- Stop it, Frank.

566
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:52,597
He doesn't deserve to die,
just 'cause you caught him stealing cars.

567
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,806
Is that what you think?

568
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,266
It's up to the law, not me and not you!

569
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,226
Why don't you tell him a little bit about yourself?

570
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,270
- You have no right to do this!
- I'm nothing.

571
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:00,730
- I'm just nobody.
- Oh, yeah? That all?

572
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,524
I pour their drinks.
I drive their cars.

573
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,807
You were doing a little more than that
a few months ago.

574
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,194
What are you trying to prove, Frank?

575
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:09,489
- You're trying to step up.
- No.

576
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:10,865
- No?
- Who are you?

577
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:14,035
Lafayette Street, 2nd floor.
Why don't you tell him what happened?

578
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,037
Please, I'm sorry.

579
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,164
- Please, please, I'm sorry.
- You tell him now.

580
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,416
Frank, I'm not gonna shoot you, Frank.

581
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,710
Nothing happened, I'm sorry.

582
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:25,922
I'm only gonna ask you one more time.

583
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,298
Ahh!

584
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,883
I didn't know!
It was an address!

585
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:30,927
This guy, I didn't even know his name.

586
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,138
He... he got wobbly with the wrong people,

587
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,266
owed something to somebody,
'cause the order came from on high.

588
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,601
Yeah?

589
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,102
What orders?

590
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,146
- The sort you can't say no to.
- Say the words!

591
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,899
You say it.
Do you hear me?

592
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,067
You don't understand these animals.

593
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,652
You can't back out.
You can't...

594
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:50,321
Just shut up!
Stop talking, Grotto.

595
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,406
You say it.

596
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,577
I won't ask again.

597
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,662
Say the words, asshole!

598
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,789
I did it, I killed him!
I killed him.

599
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,082
- I put two in his head.
- No!

600
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:03,209
- But, I swear to God...
- Oh, God damn it.

601
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,173
I didn't know... I didn't know
the old lady was in the house.

602
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,258
What old lady?

603
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,804
What did you do?

604
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,390
I didn't know she was in the house.
She wasn't supposed to be in the house.

605
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,393
She started screaming.
I begged her to stop.

606
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,187
What did you do?

607
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,523
She saw my face.
I had no choice.

608
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:33,530
Old lady left a husband.
Dead man, wife and kids.

609
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:34,824
You gotta understand me.

610
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,325
I had to do it.

611
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,914
You still think this piece of shit is worth saving?

612
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,001
I'm not gonna shoot him.

613
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,504
Yeah, okay.

614
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,885
I will...

615
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,177
...if you don't kill me first.

616
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:08,650
Not here.
And he's not uptown, either.

617
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:10,693
Nothing in the morgues.

618
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,487
Wherever our friend's spending the night,
it ain't in a hospital.

619
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,741
Guess that's as good a news as I'm gonna get.

620
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:19,035
Hey, man, with friends like these...

621
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,455
He's gonna be fine.

622
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,292
I've seen him in action.

623
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,503
I'm gonna go.

624
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,005
Thanks.

625
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,676
You know, you're good with people.

626
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,554
- Yeah, I'm a real charmer.
- I'm serious.

627
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:41,766
The only thing I ever saw stop a thug mid-fight...

628
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,559
was a bigger thug.

629
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:45,436
Yeah, I like to keep it thuggish.

630
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,691
And our mutual friend?

631
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,903
I wish things could've been different between us.

632
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:58,741
He's a very complicated man...

633
00:35:58,825 --> 00:35:59,951
and that, I don't need.

634
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,748
But maybe this city needs him.

635
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,752
And I know he needs you.

636
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:16,718
Matt made a mistake when he let you go.

637
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,262
What makes you think he did?

638
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,226
- I'm losing patience, Red.
- Don't you dare shoot him.

639
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,144
That's a bad idea.
You see, he'll kill again.

640
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,688
Can't live with that, Red.
Can you?

641
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,189
I'll leave the city.
I won't come back.

642
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,024
Shut up. Shut up.
Take the shot.

643
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,317
- Go to hell.
- Too late.

644
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,526
Why are you doing this?

645
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,529
'Cause you need to understand that pieces
of shit like this ruin people's lives.

646
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,293
Killing him's not gonna bring anybody back.

647
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,617
No, but it will keep him from hurting anybody else.

648
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:42,785
No, I won't do it again, I swear.

649
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,871
I'm gonna count down.

650
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,538
- Five...
- Look, shoot him. Shoot him!

651
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:47,664
- Four...
- Look, shoot.

652
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,792
Hey, I'm gonna hand him over to the police myself.

653
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:52,128
I'm gonna make sure he pays
for what he's done, Frank.

654
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,545
- Three...
- Shoot him! Do it!

655
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,172
Take the shot, Red, take the shot.

656
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,341
- No.
- You don't do it, his death's on you.

657
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,675
Either way, you're a killer.

658
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,386
- Two...
- What kind of choice is that?

659
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,388
The kind I make every time I pull the trigger.

660
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,390
The kind I'm gonna make right now.

661
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,081
Help me.

662
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,293
Oh, God. I'm dying.

663
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,672
- God, I'm dying.
- Stay still. Stay still.

664
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:37,956
I'm gonna get you out of here.

665
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:39,341
I'm gonna get you out of here.

666
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,761
I'm gonna get you out of here.

667
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,097
No, put me down.

668
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,947
Why didn't you stop him?

669
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,656
I'm sorry.

670
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,214
What the hell was that?

671
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,385
Come on, let's go!

672
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:27,389
Everybody on me.
Come on!

673
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:46,700
Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

674
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,944
One batch, two batch.

675
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:23,863
Penny and dime.

676
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:26,240
- There he is.
- Come on!

677
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:45,217
You're done, now, Red.

678
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:46,843
They're coming for you.

679
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,638
Only way you get out of this, is if you grow wings.

680
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,988
Open the goddamn door! Now!

681
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,322
Come on!

682
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,700
- There he is!
- What the hell's going on?

683
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:52,994
Shut up, old man.

684
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,250
Drop the gun. Drop it!

685
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,836
- You okay, sir?
- Yes.

686
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,380
Get in your apartment.
Lock the door.

687
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:05,965
What about you?

688
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,718
I'm good.
