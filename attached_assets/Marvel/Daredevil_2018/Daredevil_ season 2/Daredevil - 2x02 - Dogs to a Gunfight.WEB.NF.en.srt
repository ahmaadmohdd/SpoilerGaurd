1
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:22,398
Good. Stay there.

2
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,358
Matt?

3
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:27,195
No. I haven't seen him since last night.

4
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,364
I'll let him know what's going on.
Meet you at the precinct.

5
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:33,326
And don't let anyone talk to Grotto until then.

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,994
It was a normal evening at Metro-General

7
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:38,289
when a lone gunman entered
and began firing into the crowd.

8
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,792
Most of the patients are being moved
to other area hospitals.

9
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,044
Investigators say...

10
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:50,384
The building's clear.
Perp is not in the building.

11
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:53,722
Standby to lift lockdown.
All units hold position.

12
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:57,141
We have a report of shots fired earlier
on a rooftop up on 10th.

13
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,398
- Yeah?
- I lost my keys!

14
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,973
- Your kid locked you out?
- Yeah.

15
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,725
You some kind of idiot?

16
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:41,394
Yeah.

17
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,042
Oh, shit.

18
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,629
No, no, no, no, no.
No! Matt!

19
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:09,547
Come on, Matt, wake up.

20
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,382
You okay, Matt? Come on.

21
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,635
Get up! Matt! Matt, come on!

22
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,637
Wake up. Wake up!

23
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,806
Come on!

24
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,685
Matt, can you breathe?

25
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:25,772
Matt. Can you get up?

26
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,941
Hey, Foggy, can I get some aspirin?

27
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:56,946
You sure you don't want an x-ray?
Maybe a psych eval?

28
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,489
An aspirin's fine, buddy.

29
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:03,536
You got shot in the head.
You're lucky you're not in the morgue.

30
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,663
It was just a dumb mistake, man.

31
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,167
- What?
- The gun on his ankle, I...

32
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,462
I should've heard it, you know.
I should've felt it.

33
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,089
Are you serious?

34
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,550
Yeah, but he's fast, this guy, Foggy, he's...

35
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,803
He's trained.

36
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,720
He's a lunatic, Matt.

37
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:24,223
I went to the hospital.
I saw what he did.

38
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:26,893
- Where's Karen?
- We've been through this.

39
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,103
Oh, yeah, that's right.

40
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,189
Yeah, you're sure... you're sure she's okay?

41
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,441
She got Grotto to the NYPD.

42
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,651
We're gonna meet there, make a deal with the DA.

43
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,446
Thanks.

44
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,875
Thanks, buddy.
I'm gonna put on some pants.

45
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,836
- No.
- It's okay. I know we need to get going.

46
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,045
"We" don't need to do anything.

47
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,797
- Foggy, I don't wanna do this right now.
- Karen's safe,

48
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,298
you're safe...

49
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,258
and our client will be safe within the hour.

50
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,927
- It's all taken care of.
- Except the shooter.

51
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,761
He's still walking the streets of Hell's Kitchen.

52
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:05,223
- He's the cops' problem now.
- He's gonna plow right through the cops.

53
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,307
I know what you're doing.

54
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,725
You saw what he did to the Irish,

55
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,018
you didn't see what he did to the Mexican Cartel.

56
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:11,855
He hung them on meat hooks,
and he left them there to die.

57
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,522
- You want another round.
- Blood is being shed, Foggy.

58
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,942
And you've donated
more than your fair share to the cause.

59
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,778
- I need to stop him.
- You need to get rest. Okay?

60
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:22,031
And when you wake up, you need to consider

61
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:25,493
putting that thing back
in whatever wacko box it came from.

62
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,162
Better yet...

63
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:37,922
Let go.

64
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,423
You first.

65
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,803
I don't wanna do this again.

66
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:45,889
Then don't.

67
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:48,266
You know what would've happened
if someone caught us stumbling home?

68
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,810
- You wearing that thing?
- I appreciate it, Foggy.

69
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:53,812
- You taking care of me.
- You should.

70
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:56,232
But when the cops try to take this guy down,

71
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,651
it's gonna be one hell of a fight,
lives are gonna be lost.

72
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,238
This guy's not gonna go down easy.

73
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,034
I need to help.

74
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,411
You look like shit.

75
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,081
Stay here. Get rest.

76
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:15,876
We don't need people asking questions
we don't have answers to.

77
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,171
I've covered for you enough as it is.

78
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:25,428
And for now, let the NYPD and the DA do their jobs.

79
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:28,306
And trust me to do mine!

80
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,474
Okay?

81
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,511
That window bulletproof?

82
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:13,684
Twenty cops outside that door.
You're safe.

83
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:16,187
Where the hell are your boys?

84
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,646
On their way.

85
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,690
Place of birth?

86
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,942
Queens.

87
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,321
Relatives? Anyone we should place
into Witness Protection with you?

88
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,780
No. I got no one.

89
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,660
You don't seem rattled.

90
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:34,122
A guy tries to blow your head off, you ain't scared?

91
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm terrified.

92
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,967
- Sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Mmm.

93
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,094
The paperwork's almost done
and Brett's gonna be in in a minute.

94
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,512
Where's Murdock?

95
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,347
He took a sick day.

96
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,436
You told us the Irish were attacked
by a whole gang of guys.

97
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,938
I'm pretty sure the word you used was "army."

98
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:01,232
You want to tell me why I'm now hearing

99
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,566
this is all being done by one man?

100
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,360
- Look, I didn't know you guys were--
- Who does he work for?

101
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,003
- I got no idea!
- Well, what do you know?

102
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,530
I know he's a sociopath, that's what.

103
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,241
I mean, yeah, fine...

104
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,826
I heard the rumors, okay, but I didn't think...

105
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:16,330
I thought it was ridiculous, okay?

106
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,291
Ten, 20 guys could be mowed down at a time.

107
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,418
And with precision?
You know, tactically.

108
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,921
Every hit was like some kind of SEAL Team 6.

109
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:26,840
Then people started saying
it was one guy doing all that.

110
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,967
One man?
I thought it was a ghost story.

111
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:31,220
Some...

112
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:35,266
campfire shit you tell freshies
to make 'em crap their pants.

113
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,351
But now...

114
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,644
You saw.

115
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,272
That guy was the Grim Reaper.

116
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:44,525
Mr. Grote, I'm Sergeant Mahoney.

117
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,360
Got some clothes here for you.

118
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,196
What? Am I arrested?

119
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:51,574
Just protective custody
until we can figure out WITSEC.

120
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,658
Why the peel?

121
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,285
Or stay in the gown with your ass hangin' out,

122
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,329
- I don't care.
- Yeah.

123
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,747
We pulled the security footage from the hospital.

124
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,084
- I got ten men going over it right now.
- Any leads?

125
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,626
I was hoping you had something.

126
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:06,101
Let's let him change. You two wanna
step outside with me for a sec?

127
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,487
Now, the DA's office is sending someone over

128
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,402
to talk you through Witness Protection options.

129
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,023
- Today?
- Yeah, right now.

130
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:27,860
And listen, take whatever deal they offer, okay?

131
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,463
You don't wanna mess with this psycho.

132
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,029
So you do have a lead.

133
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,158
I ever tell you what Clemons used to say?

134
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:36,952
Gotta treat witnesses like mushrooms.

135
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,164
Feed 'em shit, and keep 'em in the dark.

136
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:41,749
That scum's on a need to know.

137
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,959
So fill us in.
Who's bankrolling this guy?

138
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,169
Who does he work for?

139
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,133
The DA's office says the shooter's independent.

140
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:50,258
Vigilante type, targeting different crime families.

141
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:54,178
And not in a... a Daredevil way.
In a Death Wish way.

142
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,429
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

143
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,391
Daredevil kicks ass, this whole city
cheers like we just won the World Series.

144
00:09:58,474 --> 00:09:59,850
But this guy?

145
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,270
He does it, and the streets get bloody.

146
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:06,649
Makes everybody stop and think twice
about the whole "hero" proposition.

147
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,526
Well, what do you think?

148
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,860
The whole force is split.

149
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,987
Some cops want him off the street,

150
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,198
others think he's making our jobs a whole lot easier.

151
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:16,450
But if you ask me, it's only a matter of time

152
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,911
before the wrong person gets caught in the crossfire.

153
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,874
Yeah, you put it that way,
I guess copycats were inevitable.

154
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,710
No, it's not the first, just the latest.

155
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:29,213
Yeah, we call them "Devil Worshippers."

156
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:32,800
Nutjobs inspired by the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

157
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,304
Shit, most of 'em are just
ineffectual idiots, but this guy...

158
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:39,307
all my years on the force,
I've never seen anything like him.

159
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,919
Oh.

160
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,422
Shit, it's not an assistant, it's the actual DA.

161
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,923
That's Reyes?

162
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,551
In all her defense-attorney-destroying glory.

163
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:39,968
How do I look?

164
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,679
Uh, semi-professional.

165
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:45,182
- No, Foggy, I'm kidding. You'll be fine.
- Okay.

166
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,865
Are they the ones that brought in Grote?

167
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,269
Um, Franklin Nelson, of Nelson and Murdock.

168
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,815
This is my associate, Karen Page.

169
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,734
Officers, I want you to prepare
Mr. Grote for transport.

170
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,070
Excuse me, but, transport where, exactly?

171
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,196
Once he's in our custody,

172
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,407
I want you to personally handle all the arrangements.

173
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,658
Just to put it out there,

174
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,536
our client's already given us
a list of his conditions.

175
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:11,208
Mr. Nelson, have you ever negotiated
a witness protection agreement?

176
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,961
Well... speaking for my firm,

177
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,339
I can attest that we're all very fast learners.

178
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,509
The District Attorney appreciates your efforts,

179
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:22,678
but our office will be handling the case from here.

180
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,138
Excuse me. Grotto is our client.

181
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,099
And it would be in Mr. Grote's best interest

182
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,392
for you to recuse yourselves

183
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,894
so he can bring in a legal team with more expertise.

184
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,480
You mean someone you can push around.

185
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,691
We had enough expertise to handle Wilson Fisk.

186
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,444
I'll say this once, Mr. Nelson.

187
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,321
If, God willing, your firm doesn't collapse

188
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,366
under the weight of the chickens
and the fruit baskets

189
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,452
you've been collecting from your indigent clientele,

190
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,746
there will come a time when you need to ask a favor

191
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,456
of the District Attorney's office.

192
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,376
And depending on how this situation resolves,

193
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,838
that favor will either be forthcoming
or permanently withheld.

194
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,008
Am I making myself clear?

195
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,676
Of course.

196
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:04,512
Now...

197
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,721
if we're through?

198
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:11,644
I'm sorry. Just one sec.

199
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:12,936
About that favor...

200
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,899
you wouldn't happen to have the number
for the U.S. Attorney's office?

201
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,943
Oh, never mind, I got it.

202
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,905
Uh, U.S. Department of Justice...

203
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,574
Office of Enforcement Operations.

204
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:26,950
What the hell are you doing?

205
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,662
Zealously protecting my client's rights.

206
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,456
Local DA's don't have jurisdiction
over the witness protection program.

207
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,168
That's solely determined by the
U.S. Attorney's office, a.k.a. the Feds,

208
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,045
who are probably just as douchey as you are,

209
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,128
but at least they can deliver on their promises...

210
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,090
and their threats.

211
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,969
Since this really isn't working out between us,

212
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:49,222
maybe I should just deal with them directly.

213
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,809
Kudos, by the way.
The cell service in here is awesome.

214
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:53,686
Hang up.

215
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:54,895
- Attorney General's office.
- One second.

216
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,065
Yes, hi. Uh...
This is Franklin Nelson.

217
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,567
- Spell it.
- Uh, yes, uh...

218
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,318
- N-E-L--
- Hang up.

219
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,907
What do you want?

220
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,702
As I see it, the District Attorney's office

221
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,328
would like to receive credit for any arrests

222
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,871
that arise from Mr. Grote's testimony.

223
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,583
And my client, on the other hand,
could definitely use

224
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,001
the enthusiastic endorsement of the New York DA

225
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,253
when entering in his witpro agreement.

226
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,173
In either case, he'll be requiring
legal representation,

227
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,760
which will be provided
by the law firm of Nelson and Murdock.

228
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,679
To put it in layman's terms...

229
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,014
cut the shit, lady.
You're dealing with us.

230
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:37,605
Let's find out if their low-life client
is even worth it.

231
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,151
Oh, Foggy...

232
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,613
- that was amazing.
- That was just round one.

233
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,366
I'll keep it simple.

234
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,118
Give me a deal, put up a camera,

235
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,912
I'll tell you everything about those Irish pricks.

236
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,999
Names, dates, their favorite titty-bars...

237
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,709
That's not good enough.

238
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,377
That's what he's got.

239
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:04,381
Most of Mr. Grote's mob friends
are either dead or fleeing the country.

240
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:06,675
If you want this office's endorsement,

241
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,136
you'll have to give us someone who's still breathing.

242
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,859
What-- So how does my client manage that?

243
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,849
We would like Mr. Grote to wear a wire
to meet one of his old associates.

244
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,185
Our files show your organization
has had dealings with one Edgar Brass.

245
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,663
Brass. You're out of your goddamn mind!

246
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,189
Grotto, calm down.

247
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,275
- We need a second with our client.
- Fine.

248
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:26,987
Who's Edgar Brass?

249
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,532
Drug-dealing butcher who's worse by a mile.

250
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,241
They send me after him, I'm as good as dead.

251
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,576
I get it, I do,

252
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,287
but chances are,
the Feds are gonna ask for the same thing.

253
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,875
Why Grotto?

254
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,711
Because we know your client
has worked with Brass before.

255
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:44,880
You got an in.

256
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,007
If he could get Brass to talk,

257
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,467
he would be instrumental
in taking down a major drug ring.

258
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,094
If I don't?

259
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,387
Then you're free to walk away.

260
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,559
But don't expect to get very far.

261
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,942
Oh, God.

262
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,318
What the hell is that?

263
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,779
You could call it "work product."

264
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:13,366
Morgue reports generated by the shooter
who attacked you in the hospital.

265
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,369
And all of these people were...
were killed by the same man?

266
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,163
He's tracking gangs to their home turf

267
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,207
and taking them out with military precision.

268
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,584
But it doesn't stop there.

269
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,793
What do you mean, "doesn't stop"?

270
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,502
His targets aren't random, Mr. Grote.

271
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:27,005
He knows exactly who he wants to hit.

272
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,508
And if any of his intended marks
are lucky enough to escape...

273
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:33,637
Say they're off buying a sandwich,
or in bed with the flu...

274
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,599
recuperating under an assumed name

275
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:37,850
at Metro-General...

276
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,353
Sooner or later, he gets to them, too.

277
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,900
Jesus Christ.

278
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:50,571
My office is offering you a chance to save yourself.

279
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,531
Whether you take it, is up to you.

280
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:56,034
And your, uh... legal team.

281
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,958
Reyes.

282
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,504
And the police have no idea who's doing this?

283
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,214
It's an ongoing investigation.

284
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,467
But our intelligence people
are close to completing a profile.

285
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,636
A profile?

286
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,119
- Even got a code name.
- Like what?

287
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,015
- "Killdozer," or "Dumbass With A Gun"?
- Not quite.

288
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,975
They're calling this one...

289
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,518
"the Punisher."

290
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:32,404
Check out the phone, man.
That's a brand new Ikea.

291
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,156
Idiot.

292
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,453
Oh, I suppose this is yours too?

293
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,039
What do you care?

294
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,082
A hundred in trade, come on, man.

295
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,969
Go on, get the hell out of here.

296
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,054
Go ahead.

297
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,392
Shit.

298
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,734
Do I know you?

299
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:13,528
I need an NYPD mobile communications rig.

300
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,156
One that gets encrypted tactical frequencies.

301
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,783
What do I look like, RadioShack?

302
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,912
Anyway, dealing in this shit is illegal.

303
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,963
Sure you're not a cop?
'Cause that's trouble I don't need.

304
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,423
- Yeah...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

305
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,718
I gotta ask, right?

306
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,010
Just hold on.

307
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,105
Yep.

308
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:52,442
Straight outta Officer McDipshit's dashboard.

309
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,988
Gets your tactical bands, surveillance feeds.

310
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,573
Hell, it'll probably pick up
the mayor banging his boyfriend.

311
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,326
It's a grand.

312
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,536
We're talking about a one-of-a-kind item.

313
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,131
Video tape.

314
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,345
Sure. What the hell.

315
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,766
What about the double-barrel under the counter?

316
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,555
Hey, man, hold on.
Sure I can't get you anything else?

317
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,308
You know, I got it all, man.

318
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,392
Yeah, bondage...

319
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,895
back-door, grannies,

320
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,105
or maybe you're in the market for something younger?

321
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,817
She's barely 12.
Guaranteed.

322
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,031
You like that, huh?

323
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,408
For 100 bucks, she's all yours.

324
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,040
That's my man.

325
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,346
What the hell are you doin'?

326
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,683
Hey, man, just take it easy.

327
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:54,147
I'm just trying to make a buck!

328
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,942
Thank you, Ms. Kwan.

329
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,194
Yeah, and it shouldn't be too much longer now.

330
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:03,740
And yes, we very much appreciate the kimchi.

331
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,367
Okay. Bye.

332
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:08,954
Anything else we've been ignoring?

333
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,706
Uh, yeah. Um...

334
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,668
There you go.

335
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,837
Thank you.

336
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,007
"Overdue."

337
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,424
"Past due."

338
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,176
"Final notice."

339
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:27,264
Hey! "First notice." That's a win.

340
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,806
Karen?

341
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,690
What are you working on?

342
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,235
- Um, the morgue reports.
- What?

343
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,612
Uh, you know, the stuff the DA showed us.

344
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,240
I'm just running searches
on the names in the databases.

345
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,324
Karen...

346
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:51,246
I could have been one of these people, Foggy.

347
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,417
- He was after Grotto.
- I know.

348
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,920
But how long can I tell myself this is just bad luck?

349
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,838
Fisk? And now this guy?

350
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,840
I mean, what if I'm drawing this stuff my way?

351
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,052
You're not.
You're gonna be fine.

352
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,887
- "Punisher" is just a nickname.
- Yeah, well, what if I deserve it?

353
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,097
What are you talking about?

354
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,893
Nothing. I just...

355
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:18,815
None of this feels real, I guess.

356
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,609
That asshole opened fire in a hospital.

357
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,112
You're not the one who deserves to be punished.

358
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,742
And plus, you got away,
which kind of makes you awesome.

359
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,996
I guess.

360
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,583
Coffee?

361
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,792
I'm buying.

362
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,627
In that case, okay.

363
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,011
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

364
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,598
I'm coming, I'm coming.

365
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,850
Hey.

366
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:36,934
Hey.

367
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:39,396
Sorry, you startled me.

368
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,314
I didn't mean to.

369
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,526
- Come in.
- Uh, sure?

370
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:45,735
Of course.

371
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,903
Okay.

372
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,034
I, uh... I heard what happened.

373
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,326
Yeah, I'm fine.

374
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,289
No, uh, actually, I'm... I'm barely holding on.

375
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,499
I really don't enjoy being used for target practice.

376
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,834
Come here.

377
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,297
I'm glad you're okay.

378
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,840
Me, too.

379
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,389
How about you?

380
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,100
Uh, me, yeah, I'm fine.

381
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:22,681
Hair of the dog that bit you?

382
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,614
It's, uh, it's not what it looks like.

383
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,493
What does it look like?

384
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,789
Sorry.
No, I don't mean to pry.

385
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,958
- I just, I worry about you a little bit...
- No need. No need.

386
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,460
- ...sometimes.
- Appreciate it.

387
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:45,795
There's no need to worry.

388
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:49,757
Yeah, you know that doesn't help, right?

389
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,801
You denying that there's anything wrong.

390
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,553
- Karen, let's not...
- No, I...

391
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,388
How many times can I hear
that you fell down the stairs,

392
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,183
- or you walked into a door?
- Well, you know, I'm blind.

393
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,017
And you know that I'm not an idiot.

394
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,609
Okay, um...

395
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,613
Let's say this.

396
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,158
When, or if, you ever feel like...

397
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:18,870
you can tell me what's really going on with you...

398
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:22,540
I promise that I'm here.

399
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,919
Is that a deal?

400
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,171
That is a deal.

401
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:31,591
Good.

402
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,553
Now, what can you tell me about
the meeting with the DA?

403
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:39,141
Yeah, um, it's...
Where to begin? Um...

404
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,976
- Reyes showed up.
- Personally?

405
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,146
- Uh, yeah.
- Any idea why?

406
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,565
Well, uh, it wasn't to bask us
in the warmth of her personality,

407
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,650
I can tell you that.

408
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,318
Yeah, Reyes wouldn't buy a pack of gum

409
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,282
if it didn't move her political career forward.

410
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,448
Well, she wants him on a wire.

411
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,743
She's got him set up for a meeting
with some big fish in the mob named Brass.

412
00:26:58,826 --> 00:26:59,911
And are they gonna protect Grotto?

413
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:03,206
Yeah. But he's scared shitless
over this psycho shooter, Matt,

414
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,832
and I can't say that I blame him.

415
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:09,629
Reyes even used it for leverage.
She called him "the Punisher."

416
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,884
- What do they know about him?
- That he's very scary,

417
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,220
but I could have told you that.

418
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:20,557
So whatever they know about him downtown,
they're keeping it to themselves.

419
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,267
All right, well, that's where we start.

420
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,061
We need to put together a file, a thorough one.

421
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,944
Find out who this guy is, what makes him tick.

422
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,022
- Great.
- Yeah.

423
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,649
Mm-hmm.

424
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,944
You think, uh... you think he's crazy?

425
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,989
Uh, the Punisher? No.

426
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,783
I think he was inevitable.

427
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:42,119
Inevitable? How so?

428
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,123
Maybe... maybe we created him.

429
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,960
All of us.

430
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,962
The moment that we let Daredevil,

431
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,797
or the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, or whatever it is--

432
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,007
There's... there's no connection.

433
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,469
Well, actually, I think
it's a pretty straight line, Matt.

434
00:27:57,552 --> 00:28:00,388
Daredevil practiced vigilante justice in our backyard

435
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,098
and we applauded him for it.

436
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,808
I know that I did.

437
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,143
And we never stopped to think that maybe...

438
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:09,231
his actions could open the door for men like this.

439
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:12,859
Men... men with guns.

440
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,278
Men who think that the law belongs to them.

441
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,532
There... there's a difference.

442
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,909
- Well, I don't see it. Not anymore.
- Yeah, well...

443
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,370
Daredevil never killed anyone.

444
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,871
Well, not that we know of.

445
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,000
There's something about this city

446
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,962
that makes good people want to
shoot their way out of bad situations.

447
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,758
You think this "Punisher" could be a good person?

448
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,593
No.

449
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,513
No, I'm just saying...

450
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:44,974
he could be any one of us.

451
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,107
I'm gonna get back to Foggy.

452
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,070
- You know he hates prepping cases alone.
- Right.

453
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,282
- Uh, if you need anything at all...
- No, I won't.

454
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,617
- ...you just let us know, okay?
- Okay, thanks.

455
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,870
Thank you for coming around.

456
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,455
Wait, Matt, I, um...

457
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:12,877
We care about you.

458
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,216
You're worth keeping around.

459
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,521
How far away was this guy when he hit you?

460
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,023
Four or five feet. Why?

461
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,734
He could've killed you.

462
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:41,197
And one inch in either direction,
your face would be spaghetti.

463
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,949
I mean, look at that shot placement.

464
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,618
I got lucky.

465
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,161
Yeah, maybe.

466
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,871
Or maybe it was a warning shot.

467
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,459
He could've finished you off, but didn't.

468
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,503
Talk about getting your bell rung.

469
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,506
Can you fix it or not?

470
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:09,183
I promised Betsy I wouldn't
do anything illegal anymore.

471
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,185
I'm not a criminal, Melvin.

472
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,939
You don't have a badge, either.

473
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,609
Look, the man who did this has
already killed dozens in Hell's Kitchen.

474
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:20,945
How much longer before innocent people
start getting caught in his crossfire?

475
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,989
Yeah?

476
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,115
You sure he didn't follow you here?

477
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:25,867
I would never allow that to happen.

478
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,830
Okay, it's just you'd never allow yourself
to be shot in the head before.

479
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,372
I gave you my word, Melvin.

480
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,874
When I promised to protect you and Betsy, remember?

481
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,086
I remember.

482
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,883
It's just I can't just fix this.

483
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,259
Why not?

484
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,762
You gotta understand, it's not just
the cracked part that's broken.

485
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:49,223
The crack makes the whole thing fragile
like a bird egg.

486
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,559
I gotta make you a new one.

487
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,936
Okay, well, how long is that gonna take?

488
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,400
I don't know, a couple days, maybe?

489
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,567
If I don't sleep.

490
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,318
What can you do for me tonight?

491
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,324
I don't know. Reinforce the cracks.
Replace some of the padding.

492
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,453
Yeah, good. Do it.

493
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,289
Okay, but it won't keep you safe.

494
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,707
I thought that's what you wanted me to do.

495
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,669
We keep each other safe, don't we?
Isn't that our deal?

496
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:20,046
Yeah, just do your best, Melvin. Okay?

497
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,805
Are you sure you're ready to go out again?

498
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,435
Do I look ready?

499
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:06,063
Hey, boy.

500
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,777
Good boy.

501
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,332
Good boy.

502
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,534
Jimmy and the boys are unloading the trailer.

503
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,161
We're breaking this down for parts.

504
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,048
Come on.

505
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,243
Hey... No, no, no!

506
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,123
Don't! Don't!

507
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,555
Reyes. Are we in position? Over.

508
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,474
Eyes on Brass. He's moving.

509
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,185
He's moving northeast to the warehouse.

510
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:51,813
- How far out?
- Five minutes.

511
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,564
Sending in Grote in five.

512
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,286
This is the frigging wire you want me to wear?

513
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:02,990
Why don't I just carry a video camera with me

514
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,114
and a guy with a boom mic?

515
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:05,952
Relax, Grotto, you'll be fine.

516
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:11,582
Look, either you are
the luckiest man in Hell's Kitchen,

517
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,043
or someone up there thinks you're worth saving.

518
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,963
- I really hope that's true.
- We're all set on our end.

519
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:18,755
Well, good for you, lady.

520
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,008
Me? I got some serious reservations about this shit.

521
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,551
Should I be concerned?

522
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,973
All we need is for Brass to admit
he's dealing drugs again.

523
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:30,142
Okay, he doesn't have to say where,
he doesn't have to say to who.

524
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:31,560
Just get him to confirm it. All right?

525
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,896
Don't make it the first question.
Don't even make it the second one.

526
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,439
Get there organically.

527
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,122
You'll be in and out before you know it.

528
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,861
- He's got no reason not to trust you.
- No?

529
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,070
Look at this thing.

530
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,364
It's like an eight-track player around my neck.

531
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,699
You came to us for a deal, Grotto.

532
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,994
You wanna walk, walk.
We can always find someone else.

533
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:51,873
After recent events,
we've got plenty of exciting prospects.

534
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:55,251
Lots of low-lives are looking to
get out of the crime business for good.

535
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,544
- I don't doubt that.
- Good.

536
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:59,171
You know where we stand then.

537
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:03,384
Maybe you should do some counseling, Counselor.

538
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,427
Hopefully before I change my mind.

539
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,099
This is not a deal you walk away from.

540
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,433
Not alive, no.

541
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:12,809
You get them Brass

542
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:15,014
and they get you away
from the psychopath hunting you.

543
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,105
It ain't just him.

544
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,899
What if it's Brass puts a bullet in me?

545
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:19,400
What if the Irish got wind I'm doing this?

546
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,609
They didn't.

547
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,736
When Fisk went away, so did a lot of corrupt cops.

548
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,821
No one's palms are getting greased anymore.

549
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:26,073
We're getting you out. Clean.

550
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:27,199
Yeah.

551
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:28,742
Doesn't feel like getting out.
Feels like getting in.

552
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,411
Deeper than before.

553
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,413
No, you're not.

554
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,123
Grotto, this is your second chance.

555
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,208
Just don't say anything incriminating,
you'll be fine.

556
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,377
- You serious? Is he serious?
- No.

557
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,379
- Is that a concern?
- No, I'm kidding.

558
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,256
You're covered.
That's why we're here.

559
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:45,259
Just let the other guy do all the talking...

560
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,844
and you'll walk out of there alive.

561
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,222
Fine.

562
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,225
These are your orders for witness protection.

563
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:54,310
Golden ticket.

564
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:57,188
It's, uh, legally binding until midnight.

565
00:39:57,271 --> 00:40:01,233
Upon which, if not executed, they turn
into the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.

566
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,609
What?

567
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,279
- Nothing.
- Let's go. It's time.

568
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,740
Bet these assholes are sending me to Florida.

569
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,742
Actually, they are.

570
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:13,913
Did I tell you I hate Florida?

571
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,539
Only about a thousand times.

572
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,379
Thank you.

573
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,423
You're welcome.

574
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:28,344
Kiss for good luck, sweetheart?

575
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:36,685
I'll take it.

576
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,902
Uh, so did you hear anything from Matt?

577
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:49,406
Um, he said he's feeling a little better.
Uh, something about turning in early.

578
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,158
Oh, that's good.

579
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:53,995
Yeah. I'm sure he's fine.

580
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,361
It's showtime.
Target's inside the perimeter.

581
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:28,654
Target?

582
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:31,991
Only an expression, Nelson.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

583
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:33,159
Stay with him.

584
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:38,789
What the hell is he doing?

585
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,792
Uh, from the look of the thing,
I'd say he's trying not to crap his pants.

586
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,506
Yo, Brass!

587
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:49,300
It's me, Grotto.

588
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:51,760
Cut the spook act and say something already!

589
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,183
Shit, shit.

590
00:41:58,767 --> 00:41:59,768
Shit.

591
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,647
You don't wanna deal, fine!

592
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,609
Find someone else stupid enough to buy H off you!

593
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,158
Good one, asshole.

594
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,704
Let's get this done.

595
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,331
I got places I gotta be tonight.

596
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:28,422
We lost visual.

597
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,595
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday, what do you call it? Abort!

598
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,513
- Abort!
- I'm a cop, moron. Shut up.

599
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,349
And sound.
I can't hear him anymore.

600
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:40,434
Probably just interference from
the metal in the shipping crate.

601
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,229
Most likely, ma'am.
We'll, uh, try adjusting the gain on it.

602
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:47,858
Package is delivered.

603
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,611
- What do you mean "package is delivered"?
- If I was you, I'd put that on.

604
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:52,488
- What? Why? Why?
- Charlie one is now set.

605
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:54,030
- Over.
- Roger that, Charlie one.

606
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,200
Overwatch positions, check in by the numbers.

607
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:58,119
What exactly is an "overwatch position"?

608
00:42:58,202 --> 00:42:59,578
Let the police do their job.

609
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:03,582
Charlie three is set.

610
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,665
Clear fields of fire in sectors one and five. Over.

611
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,189
Charlie four is set.
Clear fields of--

612
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,796
"Fields of fire" doesn't sound like cop talk to me.

613
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,465
That sounds like you're planning an ambush.

614
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:14,385
Really? You're using my client
as bait for the Punisher?

615
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:17,148
Probably the first useful thing
your client's ever done in his life.

616
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:19,681
Oh, I'm gonna have so much fun suing you.

617
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:22,434
Whatever it is that you have
planned here for tonight, it ends now.

618
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:24,103
We're getting Grotto out.

619
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:26,188
We have a situation taking place
on Tac channel one, ma'am!

620
00:43:26,272 --> 00:43:29,065
Target is inbound.
Repeat, target is inbound.

621
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,826
Take him out!

622
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:55,259
Hold your fire! Move in!

623
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,970
- Keep your bead!
- I'll go left!

624
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,472
Hands in the air! Now!

625
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:05,852
Shit! It's not him, it's a diversion.
Target's still out there!

626
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,608
The bastard knew it was a trap.

627
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:46,935
Shit.

628
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:25,391
Grotto's getting away.
We have to go get him.

629
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:26,554
No, you can't go out there.

630
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,059
- Foggy!
- This place is about to become a war zone.

631
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:29,645
- I don't care.
- I know it sucks,

632
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,605
but the safest place to be is in this room right now.

633
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:33,690
What the hell is that?

634
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:36,151
Status report.
What's going on out there?

635
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,694
Target acquired.

636
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,112
- You know what to do.
- Negative.

637
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,239
We do not, I repeat, we do not have a clean target.

638
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:42,324
Shit!

639
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:45,035
You know what to do.
Take the shot!

640
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,078
- No.
- Ten-four.

641
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,498
Take the shot.
Repeat, take the shot!

642
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,467
We lost him!

643
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,259
Foggy?

644
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,513
Ground floor clear.

645
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,058
They're gone. Repeat, they're gone.
