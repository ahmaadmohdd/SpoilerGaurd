1
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:48,717
Ellie, come here.

2
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,764
How are your hands?

3
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:56,349
They hurt.

4
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,267
It's 'cause you're bending your wrist.

5
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,855
Hmm.

6
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,231
Make a fist.

7
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,358
Lock your wrist.

8
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,526
All right. This is a punch.

9
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:10,238
This is a punch.
This is a punch.

10
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,075
That's shit.

11
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,995
Lock your wrist, breathe like I taught you.

12
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,372
- There's a man watching us.
- Forget him.

13
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:21,055
He's not watching them.
He's watching me.

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,627
The fight is that way, girl.

15
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,586
Go out and finish it.

16
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,181
- She's impressive.
- Yeah.

17
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,975
Where did you say you found her, again?

18
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,394
Box of Cracker Jacks.

19
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,817
Still needs refining.

20
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:52,697
Perhaps with more discipline or different training.

21
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,198
Left hand up, child.

22
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:06,252
When the war finally comes,
we're gonna need real warriors.

23
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,933
You were saying?

24
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,480
She's killing him!

25
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,566
No shit. Ellie.

26
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,819
Ellie!

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,741
Ellie. Ellie.

28
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,119
Slow it down.

29
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,455
Drop your breath.

30
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,416
Breathe in your stomach.

31
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,126
Nice work.

32
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,502
You told me to fight.

33
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,254
You told me to finish it.

34
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,048
I didn't tell you to kill him.

35
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:55,176
He is an asshole, but at the end of the day,

36
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,636
he's on our side of the war.

37
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:59,931
And it's wrong to kill one of ours.

38
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,515
It didn't feel wrong.

39
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,686
Listen.

40
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:10,483
Whatever it is that you got inside you...

41
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:16,614
whatever it is that burns so hot, that's good.

42
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,575
But you gotta learn to control it.

43
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,746
You said we're going to war.

44
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,705
We are.

45
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:29,460
And there'll be a time and place
for you to turn yourself loose.

46
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,962
But right now,

47
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,672
the last thing you want
is for everybody here to be...

48
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:35,967
scared shitless of you.

49
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,970
Tame that fire...

50
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,847
or they'll tame it for you.

51
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,641
Get me?

52
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,184
- I get you.
- Good.

53
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:48,146
'Cause that was just a warm-up.

54
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,024
Come on out here.

55
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,861
Show me what you can really do.

56
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,785
That the best you can do?

57
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:03,202
You haven't seen my best.

58
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,288
Well, what are you waiting for?
Christmas?

59
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,685
- You tried to have me killed.
- You got that right.

60
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:30,313
- Why, Stick?
- It's a long story.

61
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,882
Now, what do you think you're doing?

62
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,717
You have no right here, Matthew.

63
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,886
Too little, too late, Matty.

64
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,931
- Get out or get hurt.
- That's not happening, Stick!

65
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:08,559
- I'm not gonna let you kill him.
- Not your choice.

66
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:13,106
He raised you, Elektra.

67
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,273
Then he tried to kill me!

68
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,944
I should've done it years ago.

69
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,612
Shut up, Stick.
You're just as bad as she is.

70
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,197
Not quite.

71
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,491
I tried to housebreak her.
Impossible.

72
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,035
You're just another old man jealous of his disciple.

73
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:30,164
You'd rather see me dead than outgrow you.
Well, guess what?

74
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:34,043
When it comes to killing, I've always been better.

75
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,963
- Put up or shut up.
- No! Put it down!

76
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:19,380
They're gone.

77
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,550
Yeah. And they took Stick.

78
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,734
How do they do that?

79
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:41,860
Why did you interrupt us?

80
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,625
Because you would have killed him, Elektra.

81
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,615
Yes! Before he killed me.

82
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:48,326
Is that so offensive to your precious "code"?

83
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,286
Tell me this.
Why does Stick want you dead?

84
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,370
What does it matter?

85
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:53,622
It matters because Stick never does
anything without a reason.

86
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,506
All right?
And the Hand, they didn't kill him.

87
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,710
They captured him, which means he knows something.

88
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,754
And they're gonna rip him to shreds
until they find out what it is.

89
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,173
Good.

90
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,424
Unless...

91
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,884
Unless we get there first.

92
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,430
You want me to help you save the man
who ordered my death?

93
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,764
Yes.

94
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:14,393
You really do hate me.

95
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:15,769
No, Elektra.

96
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,107
This isn't about you, all right?
This is about Stick.

97
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,067
I need to know why the Hand took him.

98
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,736
And more importantly, what they're planning next.

99
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,571
I'm done fighting his war.

100
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,906
All right, fine.
Then I'm gonna go alone.

101
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:30,659
You've pushed everyone out of your life...

102
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,495
and now you want to put the little you have left

103
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,288
on protecting that broken old man?

104
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:37,541
That broken old man...
He gave me a life when I was...

105
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,961
When I had nothing, when I was alone.

106
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,046
He was the one who was there for me.

107
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,382
He abandoned you.

108
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:47,676
Just when you needed him the most...

109
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,513
because that's what he does.

110
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,806
I don't care what Stick did.

111
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,269
I'm gonna save him.

112
00:07:58,062 --> 00:07:59,897
Not if I get to him first.

113
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,942
I'm going to kill him.

114
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,905
And if you get in my way, Matthew...

115
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,658
I'm gonna kill you, too.

116
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,352
Ready?

117
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,894
Yeah.

118
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,188
All right.

119
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,752
Also, uh, let's...

120
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,630
I know that the fingerprints were probably burned...

121
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,757
But let's get some prints taken anyways.

122
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,057
You know you can go home now, right?

123
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,060
Uh, yeah.

124
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,313
You don't need anything else?

125
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:05,564
I have your statement.

126
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:08,359
If I have any more questions, I can track you down.

127
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,153
And don't worry...

128
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:13,489
that so-called "police protection" I gave you?

129
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,658
They're crossing guards in Yonkers now.

130
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,036
What? No.

131
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,413
No, no, no.
Brett, really, there's...

132
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:22,039
There's nothing they could do.
It wasn't their fault.

133
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,541
Frank followed me.
He kidnapped me.

134
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,918
Well, thank Christ you managed to get away.

135
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,629
Not many people can say that about the Punisher.

136
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,923
Seriously, go home.

137
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,218
Get some sleep.
Ambien's the real deal.

138
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:37,305
Look...

139
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,641
I know what you're thinking.

140
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,396
Maybe Castle survived.
Maybe he's still out there.

141
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,730
He ain't.

142
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,067
How can you be sure?
You ID him yet?

143
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:53,196
There's 20 burned bodies.
It takes time.

144
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,199
- So there's a chance.
- You saw the same explosion I did.

145
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,992
You're safe, Karen.

146
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,162
That nightmare you've been living, it's over.

147
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,080
Frank Castle's a dead man.

148
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,168
- Thompson!
- Huh?

149
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,379
Get her a lift.
Wherever she wants to go.

150
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,381
Get out of here, Karen.

151
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,111
Hey.

152
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,113
Sorry, just, uh, research.

153
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,823
Looking for something.

154
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,200
I paid the electric bill
through the end of the month, so...

155
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,328
enjoy it while you can.

156
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,912
And then what?

157
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,582
And then it'll be cold and dark.

158
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,004
It's really over, huh?

159
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,256
Nelson and Murdock?

160
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,593
You told me to move on.
That's what I'm doing.

161
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,933
Look, Foggy...

162
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,563
I'm sorry I never made it to the hospital.

163
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:10,814
It's been...

164
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:15,110
- a crazy couple of days.
- I heard.

165
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,071
Marci came by, though.

166
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,407
Some of the higher-ups at her firm

167
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,810
were impressed with my opening argument
in the Castle case.

168
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,619
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

169
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,039
Neither am I.
Not anymore.

170
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,043
Castle case was in many ways a disaster, but...

171
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,421
it made me realize I'm really good at my job.

172
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,841
Nelson and Murdock was never just your job.

173
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,386
It was you.

174
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,627
You're there for every client
who comes through the door.

175
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,140
Rich, poor...

176
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,476
doesn't matter.

177
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,399
You're the heart of this place.

178
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,980
You gonna try to convince me it's worth another shot?

179
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,951
No.

180
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:13,586
Oh, hey, look, I'm... I'm done here anyway.

181
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,588
So... you stay. I'll go.

182
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,758
What are you looking for?

183
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,428
You really wanna know?

184
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,556
Sure.

185
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:31,186
Well, there's this... group that I've been following.

186
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,772
They move through the city, and then they just...

187
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:34,857
disappear.

188
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,400
Like magic.

189
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:39,194
The last place I had a fix on them was 49th and 10th.

190
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,363
Then they were gone.

191
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,115
I thought maybe they
might be using the subway tunnels.

192
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,408
Only if they're idiots.

193
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,703
Subway tunnels are heavily patrolled
and dangerous as shit.

194
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:51,915
My grandfather used to tell me stories
about abandoned railway tunnels.

195
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,543
- Abandoned? Why?
- They kept caving in.

196
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:57,004
Cost a ton. The city just finally
threw in the towel...

197
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,381
Gated them up.

198
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,257
Best thing to ever happen
to bootleggers like Grandpa.

199
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,593
Said he could go for miles without seeing daylight.

200
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,429
Whoever this group is...

201
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,432
forget magic.
Look for manhole covers.

202
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,893
Yeah, that's...
Thank you, Foggy.

203
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,936
That's really good work.
Thank you.

204
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,647
That's what I do.

205
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,816
Hey, you, uh...

206
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,322
What?

207
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,536
Did you want me to convince you?

208
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,746
- Of what?
- This.

209
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,916
Us. You know, giving Nelson and Murdock another shot?

210
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,793
I was hoping you would.

211
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,795
Relieved when you didn't.

212
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,715
Last step was us both admitting it.

213
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,885
Now... we're done.

214
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,028
Hey.

215
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,656
Hey, I've got a guy on the scanners here.

216
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,241
He tells me 20 people are dead.

217
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,743
Yeah, well, I wasn't one of 'em.

218
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,286
Yeah. Well, thank God.

219
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,371
Huh?

220
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,086
So, uh, what, that's...

221
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,214
the third time you've been in
Frank Castle's crosshairs and escaped?

222
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,675
Just lucky, I guess.

223
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,639
Yeah, well, we both know that's a load of shit,

224
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,599
but, you know, just in case I'm deposed one day,

225
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,056
we'll say you're the luckiest lady
on the planet. Deal?

226
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,434
Great, great.

227
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,312
How's the, um...
How's the story coming?

228
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,314
- There isn't one.
- How do you figure?

229
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,941
Because everyone is dead.

230
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,153
Reyes, Blacksmith, Frank Castle.

231
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,530
- They're all dead.
- Mmm-hmm.

232
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,990
So anyone who was involved in the cover-up,

233
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,199
or screwed over by it, is gone.

234
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,993
So there are no more stakes.
There's no reason to write it.

235
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,162
So what am I supposed to fill Sunday's paper with?

236
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,248
Crossword puzzles.

237
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,042
Look, look, Karen, Karen...

238
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,045
I understand that this whole
journalism thing is new to you,

239
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,088
but a real journalist doesn't just up and quit.

240
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,508
- Well, that's not fair.
- That's exactly fair!

241
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,968
Stories don't disappear, they...

242
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,428
they change.
They become different stories.

243
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,555
Change?

244
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,765
I'm exhausted.
I need to go home.

245
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,017
I need... I need a shower.
I need to eat, I need to sleep.

246
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,268
I...

247
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:03,273
Why do you care so much about Frank Castle?
Hmm?

248
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,692
I mean, maybe once upon a time

249
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,694
this was about whether or not
he was innocent or some sort of,

250
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:07,986
you know, psycho murderer,

251
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,030
but that ship sailed a long time ago,

252
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,115
along with your career at Nelson and Murdock.

253
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,827
So... So why do you still care?

254
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,287
Because he is not a psycho murderer.

255
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:21,041
He wasn't a psycho murderer.

256
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,670
I don't know how you...
He killed 30-something people.

257
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,591
His family was gunned down in front of his face.

258
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,093
Now, what he did was wrong...

259
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,637
but no one, including your paper,

260
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,723
ever mentioned the fact that he was a father...

261
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:36,974
and a husband, grieving,

262
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,517
looking for answers, and you, more than anyone,

263
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:41,436
should understand why that matters to me.

264
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,774
So you're... you're saying there's more to him.

265
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,781
- Yes.
- So is this story over?

266
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,703
Fine.

267
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:58,986
- You're right.
- Yeah, I know.

268
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:00,748
Get used to it.

269
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,666
So, what?
So, it's not...

270
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,085
it's not an exposé anymore, it's what?

271
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:08,505
- It's a... profile?
- Yeah.

272
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,134
Which means... I need more sources.

273
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,094
Uh, like personal contacts, right?

274
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,470
Like someone who knew him outside the trial?

275
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,139
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Sunday's coming.

276
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,516
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

277
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,187
I might be able to get someone.

278
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,272
Maybe.

279
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,858
- Okay.
- Uh, leave it.

280
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,485
It's time to face the truth, Karen Page.

281
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,904
This is your home now.

282
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,865
Go.

283
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,195
Thank you for seeing me so late.

284
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,655
I hope I'm not disturbing your family.

285
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,991
Oh, no, no, no.
I have teenagers.

286
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,911
They haven't been home on a Friday night in years.

287
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,789
Can I get you some coffee?

288
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,874
You know, no, thanks, I'm ten cups in already.

289
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,376
Ah, Castle would call that "a good start."

290
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,338
I know I'm old.
My wife calls me cranky.

291
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,551
All the violence these days,
the media would have you believe

292
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,553
that that's all there is in the world.

293
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,682
I'm glad you're writing this article about Frank.

294
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,559
The real Frank.

295
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,269
- Well, that's the goal.
- Uh-huh.

296
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,230
To show people that Mr. Castle
wasn't just the Punisher.

297
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,440
Right, although...

298
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:16,944
how is it a lawyer is writing for a newspaper?

299
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,446
Uh, no. I was a legal assistant.

300
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,738
Past tense?

301
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,741
Uh, turns out, I just have a knack for this.

302
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:26,078
Oh, I see.

303
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,495
Uh, may I?

304
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,164
Oh, yes, of course.
That's what they're there for.

305
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,623
Thanks.

306
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:36,463
During the trial, you talked aloud
about Castle as a Marine.

307
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,755
Our primary bond.

308
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,593
Mmm. Talked about respect and gratitude.

309
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,307
You know, honestly...

310
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,144
you're the only person I can find that has
anything kind at all to say about him.

311
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,106
- Mmm.
- So I, um...

312
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,400
I guess my question is...

313
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,694
did you like him?

314
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,781
- Like him?
- Well, like, um...

315
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,452
as a man? As a... a friend?

316
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,289
You know, it's funny.

317
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,708
When you're fighting a war,
you don't really make friends.

318
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,169
At least, not if you're fighting it the right way.

319
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,379
Mmm.

320
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,422
I suppose you don't want to get close to anyone,

321
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,259
because, hey, you're...

322
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,927
you're not all coming back.

323
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,679
But at the same time, you...

324
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,556
you have to feel something, don't you?

325
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,573
Otherwise, what are you all fighting for?

326
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:40,610
I remember Frank
used to sing this horrible little song.

327
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,905
He had, uh, picked it up, I think,

328
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,822
from one of his kids' TV shows when he was on leave,

329
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,866
and he brought it back to Afghanistan with him,

330
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,202
and it was infectious.

331
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,329
It went through everything like a virus.

332
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,957
Worse than malaria.
Used to crack him up.

333
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,833
I don't know...

334
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,718
I don't know that I ever saw Frank like that.

335
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,213
You probably never saw him do impressions, either.

336
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,548
- Impressions?
- Yes.

337
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,632
Of, like, famous people?

338
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,803
Uh, well, I only ever saw him do me,
but he had a knack for it, really.

339
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:11,224
A sixth sense about ticks and subconscious behaviors,

340
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,101
and the way a brain works.

341
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,313
It was spot-on, really.

342
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,191
Unnerving, the way he could
look into a person's soul.

343
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,698
I think I know what you mean.

344
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,116
Well...

345
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:34,081
wherever Frank is now, I hope he finds
that better part of himself again.

346
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,755
Uh, Colonel...

347
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,303
did you happen to catch the news last night?

348
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,555
Um, there was a shipyard explosion.

349
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,934
Yes. Yes, I think I did hear something about that.

350
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,062
A drug deal gone south or something?

351
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,905
- Right. Yes, something like that.
- Mmm-hmm.

352
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,109
Uh, well, just between you and me, um...

353
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:06,821
the NYPD's keeping things under wraps
until the investigation is complete.

354
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,115
But...

355
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,369
Frank was involved.

356
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,828
Oh.

357
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:17,040
He was on the ship when it went up.

358
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:22,295
Police are sure?

359
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,422
Uh, well, they don't have an ID yet, but...

360
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,300
Sorry, I just...

361
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:33,098
You know, I was at the docks all night,
into the morning,

362
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,932
watching them just pull bodies out of the water,

363
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:37,269
and there's no way anyone could've...

364
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,910
After a war, some men turn their backs on you.

365
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,829
They want to forget.

366
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,666
Not Gosnell.

367
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:02,544
No.

368
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:08,841
He took the worst part of an IED
on a recon, north of Kabul.

369
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,843
Left half his face on a dirt road.

370
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:14,013
Spent the better part of a year in a hospital...

371
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,641
but that kid never gave up.

372
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,227
Never gave in.

373
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,484
It's late.

374
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,405
I'll get out of your hair.
I think I have everything that I need.

375
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,577
Once he got out, he tracked me down.

376
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,496
Asked me how he could serve me again.

377
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,750
That boy was the definition of "loyal."

378
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,216
Or was.

379
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:53,261
Before Frank Castle murdered him.

380
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,430
Colonel, please. I just...

381
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,266
I just think I should go.

382
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,643
I'll walk you out.

383
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,134
You're doing it wrong, kid.

384
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,306
If you can hear me, we got a shot.

385
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,432
He's delirious.

386
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,975
Then we change tactics.

387
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:27,397
I give you one last opportunity
to keep this conversation civilized.

388
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,191
Listen very carefully.

389
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,318
You've been tracking their weapons.

390
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,985
So they dropped 'em.

391
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:45,373
Tracking heartbeats is kids' stuff.

392
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,166
Time to go deeper.

393
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,710
Track their breath.

394
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,714
Sooner or later, they gotta...

395
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,632
exhale.

396
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,175
When they do...

397
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,386
Where is it?

398
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,887
...kick their ass.

399
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,119
Nice work, kid.

400
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,288
He leaves us no choice.

401
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,333
Sit back and relax.

402
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,709
Relax, shiro.

403
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,712
The answer will come to you soon, I am sure.

404
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,147
Listen, I won't write the story.
I won't write anything.

405
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,857
- Shut up.
- I'll...

406
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,984
Look, no one will be suspicious,
I'm not even a real reporter.

407
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,444
Just get in the car.

408
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,870
Start the car.

409
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,670
Where are we going?

410
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,171
Start the goddamn car.

411
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,392
Keep your hands on the wheel.
Don't make any--

412
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,771
Start driving.

413
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,230
Drive!

414
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,694
Turn that shit off.

415
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,742
Could've been smart.

416
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:48,413
Could've let the story go down with that boat.

417
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,415
"The real Castle."

418
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,166
Like you cared about him.

419
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,589
Yeah, pull over here.

420
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:00,882
Pull over.

421
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,465
Is he close?

422
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:45,637
Perhaps. It does not matter.

423
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,430
We will continue until he breaks.

424
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,991
Only thing gonna crack tonight

425
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:10,787
is your skull... asshole!

426
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,691
You okay?

427
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,317
I've been better.

428
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:43,820
Come on.

429
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,448
You did good, kid.

430
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:47,865
You did good.

431
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,662
No, I just...
I just did what you taught me, Stick.

432
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,497
Matty, I'm...

433
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:56,708
proud of you.

434
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,380
Come on, old man.
Let's get you out of here.

435
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,094
Hello, boys.

436
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:14,350
Do you remember when we met...

437
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:17,479
you told me you'd never abandon me?

438
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,941
It's funny. For the life of me...

439
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:25,194
I can't remember being so naive I'd believe you.

440
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:27,822
But I did.

441
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,242
And now here we are.

442
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,805
- Elektra.
- Don't be a bore, Matthew.

443
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,581
Why don't you scurry out of here
and let me finish what I came to do?

444
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,838
I told you, I'm not gonna let you kill him.

445
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,840
And I told you, too bad.

446
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:48,243
- You let her track you.
- She's not gonna hurt you, Stick.

447
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,763
You have no idea what you're talking about.

448
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:52,930
Look at that.

449
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:57,268
After all you've done,
you're still a disappointment to Daddy.

450
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,187
- I'm getting him out of here.
- He's not going anywhere.

451
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:05,359
Neither are you, child.
They got you right where they want you.

452
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,154
It's painful, raising children.

453
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:10,907
We spend our lives teaching them to be strong,

454
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,034
to be independent.

455
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:16,078
Not realizing that once we have achieved that...

456
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,165
they are no longer in our control.

457
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,750
Nobu.

458
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,968
Tell them.

459
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:33,345
Tell them why we're all here tonight.

460
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,431
You...

461
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,559
the loyal one...

462
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:38,935
and it.

463
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:14,345
I'm sorry about before.
I should've stopped, but...

464
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,915
Did you really think you could
get away with bringing it here?

465
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,541
Your kid attacked her.

466
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,502
You've endangered all of us.

467
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,420
You know what they'll do to you when they find out?

468
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,673
There are larger pieces at play here.

469
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,299
Oh, you're out of your mind.

470
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:55,762
You know what it is, what it can do.

471
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:57,096
Stop.

472
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,224
You've gone soft for that thing, Stick.

473
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:04,604
If you won't kill it... I will.

474
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:07,148
Just stop. You're right.

475
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,651
She's my responsibility.

476
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,656
I'll take care of her.

477
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,962
Gotta go.

478
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,467
Nobu, you let these two go...

479
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,094
and you can have me.

480
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:38,930
I need it.

481
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:40,890
Call me "it" again and I'll cut you in half.

482
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,851
You are right, Elektra.

483
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,062
You're not a girl anymore.

484
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,855
But now, seeing you fight,

485
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:51,067
seeing you with the man who saved your life...

486
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,235
I'd know you anywhere.

487
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,405
Do you know who we are?

488
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,200
You call yourselves the Hand.

489
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,452
Do you know who we serve?

490
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:04,956
Yeah. Some mythical piece of shit
called the Black Sky.

491
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,207
What is this?

492
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,294
The end of the war you don't believe in.

493
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,796
We just lost.

494
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:15,717
The Black Sky... is not a myth.

495
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,095
We have wanted you since you were a child.

496
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,637
You were taken from us...

497
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:23,557
but now you have returned.

498
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,393
What the hell are you talking about?

499
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,645
It's you, Elektra.

500
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,358
You are the Black Sky.

501
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,236
Our greatest living weapon.

502
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,528
No.

503
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,456
Elektra, do not listen to him, all right?
It's a trick.

504
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,418
It's another illusion, another game.
He wants something from you.

505
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,672
He told me I was out of control.

506
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:58,885
They don't get to tell you what you are.

507
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:01,137
But you said the same thing.

508
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,900
Well, I was wrong.
No one gets to tell you.

509
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:05,224
But it makes sense, right?

510
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,226
No.

511
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,147
Only if you let it.

512
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,107
It explains everything.

513
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,915
You knew all along.

514
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,501
Yeah, I did.

515
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,087
That's why they hated me.

516
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:40,092
That's why everyone eventually does.

517
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:43,304
Elektra, you still have a choice.
The woman I know is still in there.

518
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,766
Is she?

519
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,893
You are home now.

520
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:56,233
We live and die to serve you, Black Sky.

521
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,990
No, Jesus.

522
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,036
- Elektra.
- If what they say is true...

523
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:11,332
I studied it, as a child, with the Chaste.

524
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,752
I committed it to memory,
so I could fight it one day.

525
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:21,342
But there's no fight anymore.

526
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:24,971
The Black Sky is destiny.

527
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:27,723
No. Elektra. Elektra.

528
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:29,016
- Leave me.
- I'm not gonna leave you, I--

529
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,101
Leave!

530
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,437
Why are they taking so long?

531
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,523
This Ambassador and his wife,

532
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:40,194
the only thing they can't have
is a little girl of their own.

533
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,362
Now, they'll have you.

534
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:43,030
They'll never have me.

535
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:48,953
Kid, use your head.
Watch these people.

536
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,579
Watch everything about 'em.

537
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:54,291
How they walk, how they talk,
how they eat. All of it.

538
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:58,462
Playing someone else, someone fancy...

539
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,299
that's a good skill to have in your pocket.

540
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,093
Why can't I stay with you?

541
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,345
'Cause we'll be hunted the rest of our lives.

542
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:07,847
We can take them.

543
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:12,935
Ellie...

544
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:17,189
I haven't told you everything, but...

545
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,486
someday, someone will come for you.

546
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,988
And everything will change.

547
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:28,534
I'm gonna make that as far off as possible.

548
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,871
You'll train someone else.
I know you will.

549
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,960
You... You'll forget about me.

550
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,714
Forget my Ellie?

551
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:53,642
Never.

552
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,446
I pretended my whole life.

553
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:08,449
I tried.

554
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:13,870
I tried to control this inside me.

555
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,542
Maybe I don't have to anymore.

556
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:22,046
Maybe this is my chance.

557
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,298
To what?

558
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,218
To be loved?

559
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,099
Yes.

560
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:35,684
Then don't let me get in your way.

561
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,905
I am the enemy of the Hand.

562
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:52,659
So kill me.

563
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:09,926
It's too late. Let me go.

564
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:14,598
Now you could either try and kill us,
and prove them right.

565
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,601
Or you could save Stick...

566
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,812
and prove them wrong.

567
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,690
You never know when to give up, do you?

568
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,234
No.

569
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:28,779
And neither does he.

570
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:01,937
Ahh!

571
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,291
Frank.

572
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:16,178
You should be at the bottom of the Hudson.

573
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:20,682
Losing $100 million in heroin
would've been worth it to take you down.

574
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:22,726
But here we are, huh?

575
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,397
You could've been part of it, like Gosnell.

576
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,524
You could've been rich.

577
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,527
And maybe you could've taken your family

578
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,280
to the Bahamas instead of Central Park, huh?

579
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:39,535
You think this...

580
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,370
all of this...

581
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:43,455
is about a bad drug deal?

582
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:46,125
That's what you see.

583
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,420
You're losing your touch, Frank.

584
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:53,465
Your kids, at the park?

585
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:57,719
Nah. Who cares?
That's never what this has been about.

586
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,723
It's about what happened with you.

587
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:04,893
With all of us. Kandahar.

588
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,735
You think they would ever let that go?

589
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:16,447
Frank, stop.

590
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,989
You don't have to kill him.

591
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,741
Go back to the car.

592
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:20,992
What's he talking about?

593
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:22,953
- Kandahar, what's that...
- What happened?

594
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,331
- Go.
- Did you do something?

595
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:29,042
If they come after you... Just tell me.
Tell me the truth.

596
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,336
I'll help you.
I'll help you figure it out.

597
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:33,088
- Just tell me the truth.
- Yeah. Tell her the truth.

598
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:35,006
Tell me for Maria. Tell me for Lisa.
Tell me for Frank, Jr.

599
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,883
- Tell her what you did.
- You shut up!

600
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,803
- Tell her.
- What happened?

601
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,054
Please, we'll figure it out,

602
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,349
but if you kill him, you will never know.

603
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,647
No, no, no.

604
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,190
Frank!

605
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:55,402
Listen to me. Frank!

606
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:59,531
You do this, and you are the monster
that they say you are. Do you hear me?

607
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:07,163
You do this, and I am done.
That's it. You're dead to me.

608
00:45:07,248 --> 00:45:08,457
Do you hear me?

609
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,421
I'm already dead.

610
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:33,982
It's like a candy store in here.

611
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,192
Go ahead.

612
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,779
Go ahead.

613
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:43,284
I had to teach you how to hold a gun.
You remember?

614
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:47,663
Eighteen, and you'd never held a piece before.

615
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:53,710
Come on. They call you "the Punisher."
Prove it.

616
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,548
Prove you don't need me anymore.

617
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,509
One shot...

618
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:02,969
one kill.

619
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,349
You taught me that.

620
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:09,643
You stupid son of a--

621
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,097
Come on. Come on.

622
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:00,402
Still want to kill me?

623
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:02,571
Yeah.

624
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:04,906
But he'd be pissed.

625
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:12,205
I just saved your ass...
and you're worried about what he thinks?

626
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:15,584
Matt didn't come to rescue me.

627
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:16,960
He came to save you.

628
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,712
I don't need to be saved.

629
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:20,714
From yourself, girl.

630
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,888
He knew that killing me
would've been your point of no return,

631
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,056
so he stopped you.

632
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:33,602
He thinks you're worth saving.

633
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:38,774
Earn that.

634
00:49:54,743 --> 00:49:58,454
It will be ours.
You cannot stop what we've started.

635
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:00,624
Watch me.

636
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,051
Daredevil must die.
