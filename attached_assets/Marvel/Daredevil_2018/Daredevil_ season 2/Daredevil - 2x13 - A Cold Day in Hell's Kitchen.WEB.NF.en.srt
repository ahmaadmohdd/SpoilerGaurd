1
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:31,115
Master Nobu.

2
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:35,119
The necessary preparations have been made.

3
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,831
It's ready for use, should it come to that.

4
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:41,793
And as per your orders, we just obtained these.

5
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:45,964
Twenty targets in total, all in New York City.

6
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:49,217
After years of searching...

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,804
the fate of Black Sky is in our hands.

8
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:58,727
Now this Daredevil is the only thing
that stands in our way.

9
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,563
- I suggest you get to work.
- Which one would you like to hit?

10
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:08,319
All of them.

11
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,531
We need to lay low.

12
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:14,492
They're gonna come for us.

13
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:18,872
Bullshit. They'll come for her.
What is this?

14
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:22,166
I'm sorry, old man, but I just can't
take chances with you anymore.

15
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,669
You're naïve.

16
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:27,463
She should be tied in this chair, not me.

17
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,258
She is not the problem.
They are.

18
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:34,345
They're gonna turn this city upside down
looking for her, Matty.

19
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,514
They'll watch it burn.

20
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,432
That's why I said we need to work together.

21
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,810
There is no together.

22
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:43,396
All these years, I tried to tame her.

23
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,816
I should have let her bleed out
in the back of that car.

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,068
You should have some damn gratitude.
She spared your life.

25
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:54,198
The Black Sky cannot be controlled,
manipulated or transported.

26
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:57,201
It must be extinguished at all costs.

27
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,870
You wanna talk about being naïve?

28
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,706
'Cause right now you're tied to a chair...

29
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,125
spouting rhetoric about an ancient war.

30
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:07,629
Do you even have a plan?

31
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,549
I'm working on it.

32
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,927
Well, while you're working on it, son,

33
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,430
do me a favor and pull your head out of your ass.

34
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,349
- The Black Sky--
- The Black Sky is bullshit, Stick.

35
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,060
It's a myth.
No one believes it but you.

36
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,271
Every assassin in the Hand believes it.

37
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,114
What do you think they're gonna do about it?

38
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,275
What about what I believe, Stick?

39
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:32,987
What about what I'm gonna do about it?

40
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,394
Leave me alone, Matthew.

41
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,816
Stick's downstairs.

42
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,736
He's restrained.

43
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,077
You know, whatever you're feeling, it's gonna pass.

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,412
What do you know about what I'm feeling?

45
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,498
Just...

46
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:30,253
consider the possibility that
there is no such thing as a Black Sky.

47
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,050
That it's... it's mysticism, you know?
It's nonsense.

48
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:38,887
I've been trained to kill it since I was a kid.

49
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,139
Yeah, maybe everything they taught you was a lie.

50
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,641
Stick says I have a gift.

51
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:47,353
The special kind, the kind very few people have--

52
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,436
"The kind very few people have or deserve."
I know.

53
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,065
I got the same speech.

54
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:53,401
Stick likes his fortune-cookie wisdom, but...

55
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:57,571
that's all he needed, 'cause he was
training children to fight a war.

56
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,574
You can't deny it.

57
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:03,161
Some of what the Hand does defies explanation.

58
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,662
Just because I don't understand something

59
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,248
doesn't mean I'm ready
to chalk it up as some fairy tale.

60
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,960
True or not...

61
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:13,880
the legend says that once they have the Black Sky

62
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,214
they'll be capable of anything.

63
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,676
It's not about what I'm willing to do.

64
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,512
Even in a cage I'll be their false idol.

65
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,389
They'll do terrible things in my name

66
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,100
because they think the Black Sky
will make them invincible.

67
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:29,854
Well, they can't have you.
You don't belong to anyone.

68
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,355
And you may be smarter and stronger

69
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,650
and more powerful than anyone they've ever met...

70
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,322
but like I keep saying,
they don't get to tell you who you are.

71
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,491
Their organization is older than most countries.

72
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,121
They're powerful... and they're everywhere.

73
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,540
And they survived just like the Chaste...

74
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,459
by staying in the shadows...

75
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,254
by getting people to believe
wholeheartedly in their legend.

76
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:58,216
But if we shine a light on them,
they'll scatter... all right?

77
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,469
We can take them down.
Not Stick's way. We can do it our way.

78
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,807
You would trust me...

79
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,477
after all I've put you through?

80
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,609
The Hand's ninjas can mask their heartbeats...

81
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,197
Yours is always loud and clear.

82
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,118
I've been fighting this war my whole life.

83
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,579
I've heard every story.

84
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,666
Some people say Nobu's lived three lifetimes.

85
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,087
A criminal record that goes back decades.

86
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,133
True or not, he's the head of the snake.

87
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,970
But he's our best chance of taking down the Hand.

88
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,430
Then our job is simple.
We find Nobu. We extract him.

89
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,600
We remove him from the Hand
without alerting his troops.

90
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,188
Can't be that easy.

91
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,066
Giving up is easy.

92
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,947
You will kill him?

93
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,157
No.

94
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,952
That would make him a martyr.

95
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,454
I wanna dethrone him.

96
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,624
Defrock him and let him rot in a cell.

97
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,212
Show this cult of his that their holy man...

98
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:20,089
isn't anything but a guy.

99
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:25,053
- We'll have to find him first.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,972
And I say we head straight into the lion's den.

101
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,310
The last thing they're expecting
is that we hit back at them now.

102
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,731
You would risk everything for me?

103
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:47,408
So how do we do this?

104
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,579
Not alone.

105
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,169
We do it together.

106
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,115
Our firm represents Hell's Kitchen's top clients.

107
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,908
Of course, by accepting our offer

108
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:14,078
you'll get a personal assistant, a corner office,

109
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:17,915
and the opportunity to branch out
and build your own client base.

110
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:22,253
Your former associate, Ms. Marci Stahl,
recommends you very highly.

111
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,881
And after reviewing the infamous Punisher trial,

112
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:30,511
I would be foolish not to invite
a talent like yourself onto our team.

113
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:34,598
Hopefully, you'll find
our starting salary competitive.

114
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:40,854
That's...

115
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,357
one way to describe it.

116
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,525
It gets better.

117
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:49,530
How does "Hogarth, Chao, Benowitz and Nelson" sound?

118
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,157
Like a mouthful.

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,034
A good mouthful.

120
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,619
You think outside of the box,

121
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:59,290
and that is exactly what we're looking for.

122
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,126
If the past few months are any indication,

123
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,714
my firm is going to need a very resourceful attorney.

124
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,132
Someone like you...

125
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:13,304
who's not afraid to take on riskier,
non-traditional cases.

126
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,098
Cases involving vigilantes.

127
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,850
Let's call them "people with complexities."

128
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,269
You have no idea.

129
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,689
Try me.

130
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:00,601
Yeah, I don't know about this.

131
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,688
I made all this stuff to keep Betsy safe,
not just give it away.

132
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,941
- You'll get it back, Melvin.
- Without a scratch.

133
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,110
Promise.

134
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,863
If you say so.

135
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,331
Expecting trouble?

136
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:25,168
- Yeah, a little bit.
- That figures.

137
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,670
Well, it's a good thing you got company.

138
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,298
Ah, before I forget.

139
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,680
These are for you.

140
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:42,017
Merry Christmas, huh?

141
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,354
What is it?

142
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:47,105
Billy club.

143
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,858
Like the cops use, only, like,
a million times cooler.

144
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,945
It's my own design.
Special steel fiber composite cable.

145
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,738
Damn near indestructible.

146
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,407
Check it out.
You can change the length.

147
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,161
Here, play with it.

148
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,836
- Where's mine?
- That's, uh...

149
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,714
- It's a prototype. I only made one.
- Hey. Hey, don't mind her.

150
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:14,007
So, check it out.

151
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:17,052
You could use it as a grappling hook, or, uh...

152
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,389
close quarter combat.

153
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,140
The possibilities are endless.
Here.

154
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,108
Melvin, I... I don't know what to say.

155
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,277
Don't say anything.

156
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,279
I mean, the papers might not report it, but...

157
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:38,657
some of us in Hell's Kitchen,
we know who's really looking out for us.

158
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:39,867
It's yours, man.

159
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,678
How does it feel?

160
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:07,765
Knowing that the kids you've trained
are going to fight your war for you...

161
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,725
while you're sitting here?

162
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,602
Biggest mistake of your life, child.

163
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,853
Maybe.

164
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,649
But it'll be my mistake, because this is my life.

165
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:20,944
All right, let's go.

166
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,613
We'll hit the tunnels and we'll spread out from--

167
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,783
Foggy. Foggy. Foggy.

168
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,076
Foggy.

169
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:29,995
Foggy.

170
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,329
- Will you take that?
- Foggy.

171
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:33,916
- Yeah, I'll just be a sec.
- Foggy.

172
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,959
- Foggy?
- Yeah.

173
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,920
Sorry, man, it's not a good time.

174
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,964
- I was afraid you'd say that.
- Are you at the police station?

175
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,592
Brett says he's in deep shit and needs legal counsel,

176
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,010
so he was just desperate enough to call me.

177
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,845
I figured it was my problem till I got down here,

178
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,972
took a look at his face.

179
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,434
Something went down.
He won't spill it,

180
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,351
but he's been roughed up.
He says it was some gangbangers.

181
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,062
But I've known him long enough
to tell when he's lying.

182
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,523
- Why does he need a lawyer?
- They wanted files, Matt.

183
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,191
Classified police stuff.

184
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,569
All right, this...
It's gonna have to wait. I can't--

185
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,947
Not just any files.
They were asking about you.

186
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,282
And I'm not talking about Matt Murdock.

187
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:11,829
- Uh, what did they want?
- I have no idea.

188
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,032
But from the looks of him, they wanted it pretty bad.

189
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:17,876
He's helped us and Daredevil,
stuck his neck out when he didn't have to.

190
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,503
- And now--
- Yeah, okay. I'm on it.

191
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:20,879
- I'll be right down.
- Okay.

192
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,549
You better be.

193
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,501
So... this is what it's come to, huh?

194
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,629
The masked vigilante is the only one I can trust.

195
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,547
What happened?

196
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:07,510
I knew it was just a matter of time
till you showed up... again.

197
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,138
It'd be better if you just told me, Detective.

198
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:19,522
Not the first time some asshole roughs me up.

199
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,108
The job...
This shit ain't easy.

200
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,778
But then they said they got eyes on my mom.

201
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,698
Said they were gonna kill her.
Even put her on the phone.

202
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:31,199
Who?

203
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,370
No idea.
Worked for someone big, though.

204
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:39,708
Had real power behind those fists,
and I'm not talking muscles.

205
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:43,211
They wanted everything we had on you.

206
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,798
I don't imagine you have much.

207
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:50,302
Well, it might surprise you to know that
we do keep track of two things real well.

208
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,722
Records of people you put away...

209
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:56,141
and incident reports.

210
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,476
Records on everyone else.

211
00:16:58,561 --> 00:16:59,770
Everyone else?

212
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,941
That's what they were after.

213
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,694
They wanted to know everyone you ever saved.

214
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,767
Karen.

215
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,026
Get your damn hands off me, asshole!

216
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:18,826
Hey.

217
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,955
Any idea who these people are?

218
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,081
No.

219
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,084
Where'd they grab you?

220
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,002
- Who gives a shit?
- Just tell me.

221
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,090
42nd and 9th.

222
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,802
Wasn't doing nothing.
Taking a goddamn stroll.

223
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,847
Supposed to be on house arrest.

224
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,933
House arrest?

225
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,894
You're being monitored?

226
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,563
- What are you, my PO?
- Look, I'm trying to help here.

227
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,281
Thank God.

228
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,533
That means they know you're here.

229
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,704
Mmm, I might have tampered with it a bit.

230
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,914
- What?
- A boy's gotta get out once in a while,

231
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,916
- you know what I mean?
- Put it on. Turn it back on.

232
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,753
- And get shot by these assholes?
- No more talking.

233
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,297
Do you want to stay alive or what?

234
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,057
- What's your name?
- Karen Page.

235
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,558
What's yours?

236
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,106
You leave her alone!

237
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:37,738
I was a POW in Laos.
This is a cakewalk.

238
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,532
You and me!

239
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,201
One on one.
Huh? Coward!

240
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,829
- Coward!
- Hey! Look, look, look, look, look!

241
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:48,153
He doesn't know what he's saying,
all right? He's scared.

242
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,047
Not anymore.

243
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,467
The next one to make a sound dies.

244
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,807
Hey.

245
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,413
Come on.

246
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,294
Come on, come on.

247
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:38,882
Come on.

248
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,594
Come on.

249
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,638
Come on.

250
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,516
The people they took aren't the target.

251
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,229
They're bait.
The Hand's trying to lure me in.

252
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,856
It's me they want.

253
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:58,568
- You're the only thing in their way.
- Those people are innocent.

254
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,737
You can't just take the bait.

255
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,823
I know, but I can't just abandon them either.

256
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:03,907
I know.

257
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:07,160
We gotta get ahead of this thing
before any of them get hurt.

258
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,791
Slow your breath.

259
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,670
Focus.

260
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,965
Okay. Focus.

261
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,889
You'll find them.

262
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,766
You'll find her, Matthew.

263
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,231
I can't hear... hear anything!

264
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,566
The electricity in this building is too loud.

265
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,361
- The city is pulsing like--
- Matthew, it's... it's your city.

266
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,779
Calm it down.

267
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,948
- Okay?
- Okay.

268
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,909
Tune out everything that's not essential.

269
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,213
Now...

270
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,841
...one at a time.

271
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,032
Okay, go!

272
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,954
Shit.

273
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,916
Take care of it.
I'll tell him.

274
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,642
What part of house arrest
do these assholes not understand?

275
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,814
10-13, officer down.
36th and 7th.

276
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,338
They stuck him with a goddamn arrow!

277
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:50,073
Copy that. 10-13.
Officer down. Backup on the way. Over.

278
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:23,565
This is it.
There's police below.

279
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,025
Two officers already dead.

280
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,320
Fifteen, twenty hostages inside.

281
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,239
Nobu's men?

282
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,325
Yeah, they can hide their hearts, but...

283
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,453
when there's this many of them,
they're buzzing like a beehive.

284
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,330
- How many?
- I don't know.

285
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:40,582
Could be an army.

286
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,126
- Can you isolate Nobu?
- No.

287
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,463
We can't move until we're sure he's here.

288
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,256
We have to do something before these people get hurt.

289
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,799
I'm not here for them.

290
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,260
I came to take down Nobu and you said you'd help.

291
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,429
I know, and I will, Elektra,
but right now, the people in that--

292
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,306
They were used to draw us out.

293
00:25:57,265 --> 00:26:00,643
I'm sorry, Matthew, but saving them wouldn't help us.

294
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,729
There are 20 innocent people in there.

295
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,940
If we go in there right now, Nobu gets what he wants.

296
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,527
You dead, me captured.
The Hand wins.

297
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,280
I know it's harsh,

298
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,657
but the people in there are a drop in the ocean

299
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,119
compared to what happens next
if Nobu gets hold of me.

300
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,704
These people are in danger because of me.

301
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,375
And I'll be damned if I'm not getting them out.

302
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,753
- It's the wrong play.
- It's the only play.

303
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,172
You stay here.
I got work to do.

304
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:35,052
It's gonna be fine.

305
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:36,513
- Shit.
- No.

306
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:37,680
Please, oh, no, please.
It's nothing!

307
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:39,564
There's nothing there.
You don't have to look.

308
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:43,395
It's a family heirloom. It's nothing.

309
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,689
- It's okay. It's fine.
- No. Listen, calm down.

310
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,400
It's nothing.

311
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,859
It's nothing.

312
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,069
There's a button, we can--

313
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:54,739
Hold on.

314
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,658
No. No! Get off me!

315
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,326
- It wasn't my idea!
- You don't have to do that! Please!

316
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,952
He'll turn it off!
Oh, my God!

317
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:22,892
Out the door, take a right!

318
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,186
Go!

319
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,230
Go, go, go, go! Hurry!

320
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,774
Here.

321
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,573
You're okay?

322
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,243
Better now.
Oh, God.

323
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,998
- Go, go, go.
- No, no, no... wait, wait, wait.

324
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,886
Keep going out the door.

325
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,763
Wait, you okay?

326
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:01,931
- Can you help her?
- Yeah.

327
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,641
Okay. Come on.

328
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:21,451
I got bored.

329
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,309
The only way out is up.
Let's head to the roof.

330
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:13,169
The Black Sky will be ours.

331
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:30,937
Hold your fire!

332
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,980
Hold your fire.

333
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:38,027
Sarge, they have snipers
on all the entrances. We can't go in.

334
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,821
Okay, well, hold your fire.

335
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,540
Somebody's coming out.

336
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,958
I said hold your fire.

337
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,253
Oh, shit.

338
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,466
Get EMS on scene now!

339
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,428
These people are in shock.
Get 'em out of here and get 'em help.

340
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,472
- Move!
- Brett?

341
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:07,349
- Page?
- Yeah.

342
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:15,357
Any shitstorm you're not a part of?
What's going on up there?

343
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,066
These people are being used for bait.

344
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,069
There's some kind of weird cult up there,
and they want Daredevil.

345
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,325
We need those big lights!

346
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:29,704
Light it up!
Hit 'em up there, there, and there!

347
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,831
If something happens on that roof, I wanna see it.

348
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,249
Karen!

349
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,710
Foggy?
What are you doing here?

350
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,170
Jesus. Brett said there was
shit going down, but he didn't say this.

351
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,672
- Yeah.
- I'm just glad you're okay.

352
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,800
Thanks.
But I'm not the only one in danger.

353
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:43,926
What's going on up there?

354
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,722
I think it might be the end
of vigilantes in New York.

355
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,349
Holy shit.

356
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,987
I'm not gonna lie to you.

357
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,947
There's a lot more coming.

358
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,411
One thing's for sure.

359
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,120
We're gonna die.

360
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,928
Do you wanna end it here... or on the roof?

361
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:32,224
I've always liked the fresh air.

362
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,374
What's up there?

363
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,376
Oh, Jesus.

364
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:04,090
Too many to count.

365
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,676
Armed, packing katanas, couple of longbows.

366
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,764
More coming up from below.
Same weapons.

367
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:17,394
I'd say we've got a couple of minutes
before they break through that door.

368
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:20,147
Okay.

369
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,364
Even if we survive...

370
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,992
we may not see each other again.

371
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,372
Okay, let's do it.

372
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:39,208
Wait, wait. Wait for one second.
One second.

373
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,961
So, what if...

374
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,217
What if...

375
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,054
from now on, if... if we make it...

376
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,892
wherever you run, I...

377
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,352
I run with you?

378
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,439
You're not serious.

379
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,275
I've never been more serious.

380
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:10,990
This... Elektra, this is a part of me that I need.

381
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:14,494
And you're the only one who gets it.

382
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:17,789
Without this, I'm not alive.
I'm not. Not really.

383
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:20,958
And I know that now, thanks to you.

384
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,046
I don't know what we are together,

385
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,674
and if we have any chance in the future...

386
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,801
I don't...

387
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,971
But I... I do know that I'm free with you.

388
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:36,766
Like with no one else.

389
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,269
You hide from yourself.

390
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,649
You don't let anyone in.

391
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:45,817
You.

392
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,529
I let you in.

393
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,533
Think about it.

394
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,619
What if this isn't the end?

395
00:33:57,954 --> 00:33:59,706
What if it's just the beginning?

396
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:01,958
No.

397
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,921
They'll find us.

398
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,505
No, we'll keep moving.

399
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:13,553
We'll change identities. We'll...
we'll hide. They'll never catch us.

400
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,013
What do you say?

401
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,977
Uh, I say...

402
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,395
let's go to London.

403
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,608
Yeah? Madrid.
Tunisia.

404
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:28,735
There are sexy places to hide.

405
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:32,780
Hey, I've never been further north
than 116th Street, so...

406
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,700
Because you love New York.

407
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:38,285
And I'd give my life for it, but...

408
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,249
there's one thing in this world
that makes me feel more alive.

409
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,376
And that's you.

410
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:50,590
I'm the Black Sky, Matthew.

411
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:53,134
Yeah, and I'm the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

412
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,641
The airport's just a cab fare away.

413
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:03,728
All we gotta do is survive whatever's
waiting for us behind that door.

414
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,480
Let's get out of here.

415
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:26,458
Remember they're trying to kill me, not you.

416
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:27,919
Over my dead body.

417
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,732
No one...

418
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,028
escapes destiny.

419
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,496
You belong to us.

420
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,333
- And you...
- belong in the ground.

421
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,839
You're done, Nobu.

422
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,424
Your army will crumble.

423
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,010
And you will leave my city alone.

424
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:44,471
Your city belongs to no one.

425
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,473
And she...

426
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,392
belongs to us!

427
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:46,783
No.

428
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,582
No, Elektra.

429
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:00,756
They have nothing now.

430
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:04,010
I took it all away.

431
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:11,683
It's okay. It's okay.
Try not to talk.

432
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,731
I know... I know now...

433
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:21,652
what it feels...

434
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,031
to be good.

435
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,785
Just relax.

436
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,620
Try not to... try not to talk.

437
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,419
Does it always hurt that much?

438
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,343
Yeah.

439
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,639
Yeah, it, uh... it always hurts that much.

440
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,979
This is not the end.

441
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:48,155
Finish him.

442
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,045
Get down. Get down.

443
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,505
Don't move!
Everybody get down!

444
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,042
Frank.

445
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,763
See you around, Red.

446
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:13,049
And this time, you piece of shit...

447
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:21,475
...stay down.

448
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,264
I wanted to say a few words, but...

449
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,934
I don't have any.

450
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:08,480
God rest her soul.

451
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,817
That should be enough.

452
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,573
You know, once in college, I brought her roses.

453
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,577
She hates roses.

454
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,293
You wanted her dead.

455
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,510
Was it worth it?

456
00:44:41,347 --> 00:44:42,681
What?

457
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:45,559
Loving her.

458
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,776
You taught me to cut all my ties to humanity...

459
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,488
to other people.

460
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,033
I had only a few moments with her...

461
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,332
amidst all the... noise, chaos, and the violence.

462
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,880
We were together only for moments.
That was all.

463
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,763
Orchids.

464
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,349
She likes orchids.

465
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:31,104
And, yeah, Stick... it was worth it.

466
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:40,196
Matt, you are the toughest
son of a bitch I have ever met.

467
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,617
Let's go home.

468
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,512
Are you gonna be okay?

469
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:50,183
I came to New York thinking there's no way
I could feel lonely in a city of millions.

470
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:53,395
But you do.

471
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:55,731
Somehow it makes it all worse.

472
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:00,402
I used to love coming here...

473
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:02,320
with you and Matt.

474
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:05,657
Josie's actually felt like home.

475
00:47:06,617 --> 00:47:10,829
A home with... very sticky floors
and belligerent drunks, nightly.

476
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,330
Right.

477
00:47:13,457 --> 00:47:15,166
And now, no Matt.

478
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:18,587
No us.

479
00:47:19,505 --> 00:47:21,507
No Nelson, Murdock, Page.

480
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,472
We may not be working together anymore...

481
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,932
but you're not alone, Karen.

482
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,018
I'm still your friend...

483
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,103
if you'll let me be.

484
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:40,108
Yeah, you're not getting out that easy, Nelson.

485
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,735
You are stuck with me.

486
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,987
Wouldn't have it any other way.

487
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,365
You're gonna be all right.

488
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:49,951
More than all right.

489
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:52,287
- You're gonna come out on top.
- Thanks.

490
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,914
How about you?

491
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:57,375
Big job, hotshot, corner office lawyer man.

492
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:59,795
It could be exciting.

493
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,963
- Yeah, you could be rich.
- Yeah, rich enough to stop drinking

494
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,425
the rotgut swill they serve here.

495
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:09,179
Hey, Josie.

496
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:13,266
About that long-running Nelson-Murdock tab...

497
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,976
- Yeah, yeah, I'll add it on.
- No.

498
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,146
We're, uh... we're gonna settle up.

499
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:21,608
Close us out, Josie.
We're done here.

500
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:50,303
Karen Page, what the hell are you still doing here?

501
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,763
It's Christmas Eve.

502
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:55,851
Shouldn't you be home celebrating
with all that family that you...

503
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,978
can't stand, like everybody else?

504
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,896
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I must be projecting.

505
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,273
I, uh...

506
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,486
can't seem to stop staring at a blank screen.

507
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:07,153
- Writer's block.
- Mmm.

508
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:08,655
There's a cure.

509
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:12,450
- Scotch.
- That helps you write?

510
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,202
Wow! No.

511
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,414
No, it just... helps me not care so much.

512
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:21,042
Yeah, well, that's definitely my problem.

513
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,547
I care, probably too much, about all of it.

514
00:49:26,507 --> 00:49:29,635
I don't even know if I should start with...

515
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:32,804
the hostage crisis, or Frank, or vigilante justice--

516
00:49:32,888 --> 00:49:34,723
That's just... that's just garbage.

517
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,602
- Well, it's news.
- No, it's not.

518
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:42,105
Not anymore. I mean, all the facts
about that have been reported already.

519
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,399
Look.

520
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:49,487
If you... if you really wanna
torture yourself this holiday,

521
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:51,072
go ahead, be my guest.

522
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:54,284
But at least write something new.

523
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,244
Something different.

524
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,205
- Something that only you can write.
- Right. Which...

525
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,625
which would be what?

526
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:02,959
The truth.

527
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:06,171
Your truth, Karen.

528
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:10,216
All of it.
Everything that you've been through.

529
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,260
Don't pull any punches.

530
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,932
This is New York.
People think that they've seen everything.

531
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:22,813
Prove 'em wrong.
Tell them something they don't know.

532
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:27,483
Hell, I'd read the shit out of that.

533
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,329
Happy Hanukkah.

534
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:44,751
- Scotch.
- Mmm, you know, just... just in case.

535
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:50,090
I'll expect 2,000 words in my inbox
before Santa shows up.

536
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,134
You got it, boss.

537
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:10,193
Okay.

538
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:30,130
"What is it, to be a hero?

539
00:51:31,632 --> 00:51:33,884
Look in the mirror and you'll know."

540
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:51,943
"Look into your own eyes
and tell me you are not heroic,

541
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:55,238
that you have not endured, or suffered...

542
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:58,950
or lost the things you care about most.

543
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,913
And yet, here you are...

544
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,624
a survivor of Hell's Kitchen...

545
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,920
the hottest place anyone's ever known.

546
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:12,881
A place where cowards don't last long.

547
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,425
So... you must be a hero.

548
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:19,846
We all are.

549
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:23,183
Some more than others, but none of us alone.

550
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:27,478
Some bloody their fists
trying to keep the Kitchen safe.

551
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:35,111
Others bloody the streets
in the hope they can stop the tide,

552
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,155
the crime, the cruelty...

553
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:41,159
the disregard for human life all around them.

554
00:52:42,703 --> 00:52:44,370
But this is Hell's Kitchen.

555
00:52:46,707 --> 00:52:51,502
Angel or devil, rich or poor,
young or old, you live here.

556
00:52:52,462 --> 00:52:55,799
You didn't choose this town.
It chose you.

557
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:04,557
Because a hero isn't someone
who lives above us, keeping us safe.

558
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,268
A hero is not a god or an idea.

559
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,105
A hero lives here...

560
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:13,984
on the street, among us, with us.

561
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:17,988
Always here but rarely recognized.

562
00:53:19,865 --> 00:53:24,160
Look in the mirror
and see yourself for what you truly are.

563
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,468
You're a New Yorker.

564
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:47,100
You're a hero.

565
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,561
This is your Hell's Kitchen.

566
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,689
Welcome home."

567
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,088
Thanks for meeting me.

568
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,517
What am I doing here, Matt?

569
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:34,147
I, uh... I have something.

570
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,817
- No, I don't want it.
- I have something...

571
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,071
that I need you to see.

572
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,261
I'm Daredevil.
