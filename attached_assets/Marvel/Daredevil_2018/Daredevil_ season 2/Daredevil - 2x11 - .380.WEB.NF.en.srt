1
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,097
Now, watch out.

2
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,682
One of them killed his father with a scalpel.

3
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:58,643
I don't know about the rest,
but don't take any chances.

4
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:00,770
We just need to quarantine them until the cops can--

5
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,230
- Claire...
- Oh, my God!

6
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:03,397
What the hell?

7
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,243
Temple!

8
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:16,661
No! Louisa!

9
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:07,521
Don't let him take us back down there.

10
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,574
So, there's this...

11
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,451
organization.

12
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:47,205
Its members believe in some pretty... strange shit.

13
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,249
And they have deep pockets,

14
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,169
even deeper connections all over Hell's Kitchen.

15
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,589
- Like a cult?
- It's kinda hard to explain.

16
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,342
They call themselves the Hand.
Nobu's one of them.

17
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,928
Those killers who attacked us,
I think they work for him.

18
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,762
Why did they want those patients back?

19
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,764
Honestly, I don't know.

20
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,189
That candle that you're burning at both ends?

21
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:16,400
Sooner or later, it's gonna fizzle out.

22
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:18,402
I'm fine. Really.

23
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,657
You know the problem with martyrs?

24
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,202
The good ones end up dead.

25
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,997
You know, it's... it's one thing
to try to take on the mob,

26
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,208
or to block some shady real estate deal.

27
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,292
But this stuff?

28
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,378
- Those people just killed your friend.
- I know!

29
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,131
I can't just let that happen, Claire.
Not in my city.

30
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:40,633
It's not your city anymore!

31
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,843
Matt, admit...

32
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,304
you're in over your head.

33
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,348
There's no shame in that.

34
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,187
Yeah?

35
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,315
When? Oh...

36
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,401
I'll be right down.
Thanks.

37
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,489
Hey, I gotta go.
It's important.

38
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,160
Okay.

39
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,204
Really am sorry.

40
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,125
So am I.

41
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:31,809
We're almost done.

42
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,103
Thanks.

43
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:37,273
Just want to go over your statement one more time.

44
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,818
You're sure you didn't see anything
unusual outside your apartment?

45
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,070
Not that I remember.

46
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,155
And the man who blindsided the two officers,

47
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,532
you couldn't tell if it was Castle?

48
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,783
Like I said in my statement,

49
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,120
when the shooting began,
I hit the decks and stayed there.

50
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,621
I didn't see anything.

51
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,874
Smart.
Powell, I think we're good.

52
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,336
Go ahead and pull your car around.

53
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,344
Are you okay?

54
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,221
It's been a long night.

55
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,474
Have there been any developments?

56
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,102
Besides making sure Castle's face is plastered across

57
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,145
every TV channel and newspaper?

58
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,815
The DA and the medical examiner are dead,

59
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,068
the same asshole takes a shot at you,

60
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,863
and so far nobody in this entire city's
seen a damn thing.

61
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,323
I'm...

62
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,953
I'm sorry.
That wasn't, uh, very professional.

63
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,039
Mmm. Like you said, it's been a long night.

64
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:36,582
We'll nail him.

65
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,294
Until then, I'm just glad you agreed
to accept police protection.

66
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,589
I appreciate the offer.

67
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,174
All right, the car's outside.

68
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:47,926
Powell and Reed will escort you to a safe location.

69
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,764
We'll keep someone posted outside, 24/7.

70
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:52,890
Right.

71
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:56,185
If you remember anything, anything...

72
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,979
you know where to find me.

73
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,960
Sorry, he's, uh...

74
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,712
Can you give me a minute?

75
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:24,797
Thanks.

76
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,550
- Matt.
- Karen.

77
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,010
What are you doing here?

78
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,886
Brett reached out.
Someone shot at you?

79
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,015
Yeah, it's... it's okay.
I'm fine.

80
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,684
Why didn't you call me?

81
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,851
Would you have answered?

82
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,865
Look, Matt, I know that you mean well,
but I can take care of myself.

83
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,816
No, you can't, Karen.

84
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,277
Not if Frank Castle wants you dead.
No one can.

85
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,200
You're right! You're right!
Castle's dangerous,

86
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,281
and maybe I can't handle this,
but I don't want your help.

87
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,404
What's going on with you?
What are you holding back?

88
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,748
Frank didn't do this, okay?

89
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,584
Matter of fact, he saved me.

90
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,711
What?

91
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,258
He was at my apartment last night.

92
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,510
And if he hadn't been watching the place,
I'd be dead.

93
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,346
Except the cops have it all wrong.

94
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,348
Frank didn't kill Reyes.

95
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,558
But whoever did knew that Frank would take the blame,

96
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,227
and what do you know, every cop in New York City

97
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,894
wants Punisher's head on a stick.

98
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,233
You told this to the police?

99
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,401
- No.
- Great! Lying to the cops. Smart, Karen.

100
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,445
But that's my problem, not yours.

101
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,530
Frank thinks he can find this guy
faster than the NYPD,

102
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,532
and, honestly, I agree with him.

103
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,662
He saved my life and he asked me for time.
I... I owe him that much.

104
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:42,833
Not saying I'm going along with this,
but if Castle's not the shooter, who is?

105
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:47,463
Everything points back to the Central Park sting.

106
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,341
That's where everything fell apart.
What Reyes mentioned.

107
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,927
- This Blacksmith?
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

108
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,554
Frank has a source in prison.

109
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:58,238
Turns out the DA was right,
that the Blacksmith arranged the meet.

110
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,976
Why would the Blacksmith come after you?

111
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,687
I've been working with Ellison at the Bulletin.

112
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:07,441
Yep. Yeah, that'll be it.

113
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,610
- When... when, when did this start?
- Ever since the trial.

114
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,196
When I was trying to find evidence
for the Castle case.

115
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,990
We were looking into the Central Park shootings,

116
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,534
and I guess we're getting too close.

117
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,702
- Then you need to back off.
- No, Matt. You need to back off!

118
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,579
This is not a game, Karen.
This is dangerous.

119
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,332
Right, well, so was working
at Nelson and Murdock. I...

120
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:30,005
The cops have offered me protection
and I'm... I'm taking it.

121
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,341
So you don't have to worry.
I'm... I'm fine.

122
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,511
Look, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

123
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,971
- I'm gonna come with you--
- No! Matt, I'm...

124
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,808
I'm not yours to protect.

125
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,448
Room's been checked, it's clear.

126
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,700
You need anything, anything at all,
we'll be just outside.

127
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,953
Okay, thanks.
What I need is about 12 hours' sleep.

128
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,132
You said you'd bring a car, not steal mine.

129
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,675
It's a good song.

130
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,928
We used to sing along to that.

131
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,055
Imagine me doing that.

132
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,477
I inherited the tapes with the car.

133
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,981
Hey...

134
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,028
Look, maybe you don't wanna be here, mmm?

135
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,531
Gotta say, I'm having second thoughts.

136
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,284
I'm not a lawyer.

137
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,952
I'm not protected by attorney-client privilege.

138
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,837
Lying to the cops, that makes me an accessory.

139
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:27,998
Okay.

140
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,834
So, walk away. Go.

141
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:39,343
Blacksmith already tried to get me once.

142
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,554
I really don't wanna give him a second chance.

143
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,226
He's not gonna get it.

144
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,781
Hello, Mr. Nelson.
You decent?

145
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,371
Oh, boo.
I was hoping to catch an eyeful.

146
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,540
No such luck.

147
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,124
It's a Foggy Bear.

148
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,710
Calm down, I also brought you this.

149
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:17,840
There's a, uh, lot of extra security out there.

150
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:18,924
Oh.

151
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,718
Anything going on I should know about?

152
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:22,886
Um, I don't know.

153
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,972
I heard a hell of a lot of noise last night.

154
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,849
You didn't see Matt on the way in, did you?

155
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,308
Sorry.

156
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,894
So, how are you, really?

157
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,146
Peachy.

158
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,950
I'm in the hospital with a hole in my arm
and Nelson-Murdock's kaput.

159
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,234
They say it comes in threes.

160
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,694
Next you're gonna tell me Josie's burnt down.

161
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,738
Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

162
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:44,575
But actually, I'm here...

163
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,660
to present you with a new opportunity.

164
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,245
People around town have been talking about you.

165
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,873
About how I blew the trial of the century?

166
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,332
Give yourself more credit.

167
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,002
Your opening statement set the tone for the trial.

168
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,712
Which, if Castle hadn't been such a lunatic,

169
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,838
you might've actually won.

170
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,508
Some are saying it was... impressive.

171
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,802
I lost the case.
My firm imploded.

172
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,846
And now you're a free agent.

173
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,099
You can finally be your own man.

174
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:14,021
What you might consider a failure
could actually be something else.

175
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,313
A new beginning.

176
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:19,943
I knew you were gonna be sensitive about this.

177
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,570
That's what I like about you.

178
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:27,743
I'm just asking if it would be okay,
in the near future,

179
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,537
for me to set up a meeting.

180
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,705
Where?

181
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,041
All in time.

182
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,959
I need to float your name first.

183
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:39,046
And here I was thinking you were gonna
take advantage of me in my fragile state.

184
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,214
No, Franklin.

185
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,552
Not yet.

186
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,683
You've already gone above and beyond.

187
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,522
This has been a very traumatic day.
You sure you wanna be down here?

188
00:14:56,605 --> 00:15:00,275
Ms. Temple, we get that NYPD paperwork finished?

189
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,359
Yeah.

190
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:05,072
Did you mention the part
where you unethically and unilaterally

191
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,450
brought those five patients into this hospital?

192
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,909
Whoa, easy.

193
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,704
With all due respect, we just lost one of our own.

194
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,121
And whose fault was that?

195
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,667
The board is gonna have
a goddamn field day with this.

196
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,044
All right, stay put.

197
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,005
There's no way he can put all this on you.

198
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,215
He'll try.

199
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,301
I broke the rules.

200
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,804
He came after you, Claire.
What choice did you have?

201
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,556
I'm a nurse.

202
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,975
Took an oath to save people, not kill them.

203
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:36,687
It was you or him, and you saved yourself.

204
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,524
Male. Height, 5'10".

205
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,360
Approximate age, 30, 35 years.

206
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:46,071
Weight, 185...

207
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,366
- What the hell?
- What is that?

208
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,078
- This scar, it looks like it's from--
- An autopsy.

209
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,873
That's not possible.

210
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,416
I've seen enough dead bodies
to know what a Y-incision looks like.

211
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,418
He was cut evenly.
Precisely.

212
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,129
That's where they spread open the body cavity

213
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,631
and examine the internal organs.

214
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,508
Maybe it was some sort of freak accident.

215
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,636
Uh, uh, unorthodox open-heart surgery...

216
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,054
Look at him.
He was gutted like a fish.

217
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,600
Claire, you are not seriously suggesting
that this guy's been dead before.

218
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:15,893
Wait a minute, she said what?

219
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,230
All right, that's it.
I'm shutting this down.

220
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,565
You and you, out!

221
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,609
And you, not a word to anyone, understand?

222
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,973
You don't think that this looks
just a little bit strange?

223
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,238
At least bring in the coroner,
have them check and see--

224
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,865
You're not hearing me.

225
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,409
I'm not jeopardizing this hospital's financial future

226
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,077
over a nurse's wild-eyed--

227
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,841
Wait, all of a sudden, this is about money?

228
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,289
That's none of your business.

229
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,457
This hospital was attacked.
People are dead--

230
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:42,294
Enough. I've heard all I'm going to from you, Temple.

231
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,130
Go back to your job, and let me do mine.

232
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,343
Come on.

233
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,782
Shh! Take it easy.

234
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,325
Breathe.

235
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,953
It's better me than Frank Castle.

236
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,706
But he's not your only problem right now.

237
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,333
Give me everything you have on the Blacksmith.

238
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,586
How did you hear about him?

239
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:26,880
All you need to know is that Frank Castle wants him.

240
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,758
And he's gonna turn this city
into a war zone to find him.

241
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,052
Okay, what do you need?

242
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,762
Whatever you have.

243
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:35,556
Nationality, source point, known allies, anything.

244
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,891
We don't have it.
We never had more than his code name.

245
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,644
That's what makes him so high value, he's elusive.

246
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,368
Look, I'm telling you, three government
agencies couldn't find him.

247
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,023
The only lead we have...

248
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,318
Say it.

249
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,072
Look, it's thin.

250
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:55,784
Reyes was looking into the Blacksmith's competition.

251
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,452
There's a new rival on the scene.

252
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,121
Doesn't move half the product but...

253
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,081
but it's still more than everyone else.

254
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,126
- Look, Reyes figured if anyone has--
- Keep your eyes forward.

255
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,337
If anyone has a clue about the Blacksmith's identity,

256
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,047
it would be his worst enemy.

257
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,676
- Give me the name.
- We don't have one.

258
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,804
- Uh, but our intel gave us a source point.
- Where?

259
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:21,018
Look, the only place where drugs
and corruption rival your neighborhood.

260
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,729
Chinatown.

261
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,024
All right, good. Now get up.

262
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,358
Slowly.

263
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,243
Wherever you were going...

264
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,663
just stay there.

265
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,417
Not so sure stopping is such a good idea.

266
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,961
- You're not hungry?
- No, not really.

267
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,632
You don't think the neighborhood's a little sketchy?

268
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,884
Oh, yeah.
I'm shaking in my boots.

269
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,510
Ma'am?

270
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,387
Just get a little black coffee over here?

271
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,143
Anything new from the cops?

272
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,689
Just that they want you dead.

273
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,315
Yeah...

274
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:12,235
How about that, uh... that DA?
She have anything on the Blacksmith?

275
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,822
Only that he's moving an unprecedented--

276
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,244
Unprecedented volumes
of uncut narcotics into Manhattan.

277
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,164
- How's he doing it?
- Well, that'd be the mystery.

278
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,376
Okay, look, there's, uh...

279
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,922
an unfinished highway on Long Island

280
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,133
that was illegally used
as a landing strip in the '90s.

281
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,969
I mean, it would require payoffs, bribes--

282
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,930
This guy's a ghost.
He works alone or close to it. I just--

283
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,682
- How do you know?
- I just do.

284
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:48,271
Okay, so, what, that leaves us with
railroads, shipping lines, trucks, maybe?

285
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,439
Hey.

286
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,399
Thank you.

287
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,612
- How 'bout you, hon?
- Sure, yeah.

288
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,450
Get anything else right now?

289
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,828
You know what, I'm gonna need about
as much black coffee

290
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,162
as this place would pump out.

291
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,373
So, just keep it coming.

292
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,750
Thank you.

293
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,545
You didn't seem surprised that I owned a gun.

294
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,884
I guess the only thing that surprised me
is that you didn't plug me.

295
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,097
You pick it out yourself?

296
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,306
Why?

297
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,559
People who don't know shit about guns
usually go for something shiny.

298
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,813
You know, something with a... with a fancy grip.

299
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,107
There's always the asshole
who gets the big hand cannon

300
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,777
that kicks like a mule
and they're too afraid to use it.

301
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,155
But a... 380 shows thought.

302
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,786
- Maybe it's not your first rodeo.
- Maybe it isn't.

303
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,541
- Almost took the shot.
- Did you?

304
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,709
And, uh...

305
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,671
can I ask you why you didn't?

306
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,215
Because I believe you.

307
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,639
I don't like what you do.

308
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,643
And ultimately, I think you probably belong in jail.

309
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,145
But you...

310
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,232
you're honest. You...

311
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,068
you never lie to me.

312
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,737
Does he?

313
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:21,573
- Who?
- Come on.

314
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,491
Let's not do that.

315
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,411
Okay. The lawyer.

316
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,496
Not the other one, uh...

317
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,208
Murdock.

318
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,129
Um...

319
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,718
Yeah. Yeah.

320
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:47,182
He's got issues.
It's complicated, like most people.

321
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,311
Hard person to get to know.
I just think that inside he's--

322
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,355
You love him, right?

323
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,276
- You can't know that.
- I'm sorry, can't know what?

324
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,612
You can't...

325
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,739
Come on.
We're in court,

326
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,867
all that shit going on, it's all over your face.

327
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,577
You can't hide that.
You love him.

328
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,705
Ma'am, just a little bit more.
Thank you.

329
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,375
I might have... feelings for Matt Murdock,

330
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,503
but it's just... it's a swirl, it's a lot of things.

331
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,255
Like...

332
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,382
ingredients.
It's not love.

333
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,052
Ma'am, can I ask you,
do you guys always serve bullshit here

334
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,471
or is that just her, huh?

335
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,723
Fresh pot.

336
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,852
I'm sorry. You were saying?

337
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,317
He's the kind of man who hurts people.

338
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,404
Not like you, but...

339
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,490
he damages them.

340
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:48,701
Breaks them.

341
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,871
Sorry, is that supposed to mean something?

342
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,291
So those are the people
that you get out of your life.

343
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,084
Is that right?

344
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,796
Look, I might generally be considered
out of my skull,

345
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,965
so this might not mean much,
but this could be the craziest,

346
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,176
most batshit thing I've ever heard in my life.

347
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,886
People that can hurt you,
the ones that can really hurt you,

348
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,431
are the ones that are close enough to do it.

349
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:12,017
People that get inside you and... and...

350
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,769
and tear you apart, and make you feel
like you're never gonna recover.

351
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,980
Shit. I'd--

352
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:21,068
I-- I would chop my arm off
right here, in this restaurant,

353
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,445
just to feel that one more time for my wife.

354
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,575
My old lady, she didn't just break my heart.
She...

355
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,997
She'd rip it out, she'd tear it apart,
she'd step on that shit, feed it to a dog.

356
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,916
I mean, she was ruthless.
She brought the pain.

357
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,836
But she'll never hurt me again.

358
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,381
You see, I'll never feel that.

359
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,971
You sit here and you're all confused
about this thing, but you have it.

360
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,680
You have everything.

361
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,642
So, hold on to it.

362
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:58,771
Use two hands and never let go.
You got it?

363
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,901
Now, you need to go in the back and get the waitress.

364
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,071
You tell the cook and anyone else
who's back there to find

365
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,754
the biggest piece of stainless steel
and you get under it. Go now.

366
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,117
Wait. What's happening?

367
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,578
The Buick. It's rolled around the block
three times before it pulled up.

368
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,746
Who are they?

369
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,624
Just some guys who are about to
walk into a diner for the last time.

370
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,835
Wait, you... you wanted them here.

371
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,881
You parked me outside like... bait.

372
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,174
You need to go.

373
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,427
- You're such an asshole.
- Yeah.

374
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,554
You got that right.

375
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,389
Pell drop is done.
Still waiting on Lafayette and Ludlow.

376
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:20,228
Ping, your kid's messing around
with the carousel again.

377
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:23,731
My kid's at basketball, asshole.

378
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,917
Yang, you better get up here.

379
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,778
Come here!

380
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,241
Who do you work for?

381
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,743
Screw you.

382
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,605
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

383
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,192
Madame Gao.

384
00:26:56,032 --> 00:27:00,287
I see from the uniform
you've taken the Devil's name to heart.

385
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:06,209
Yeah, I had to... 'cause of people like you.

386
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:10,129
So, you continue your fight,
but for how long, I wonder?

387
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,799
And at what price?

388
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:22,642
- Call your men off.
- Why would I do that?

389
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,395
'Cause, otherwise, I'm gonna break their legs.

390
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,774
We speak alone.

391
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,986
Call them off.

392
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,244
They'll be gone shortly.

393
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,499
When you are satisfied we're alone, we'll talk.

394
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:51,248
The Blacksmith. Where is he?

395
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,959
Screw you.

396
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,387
Where?

397
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,847
Go to hell.

398
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,559
Okay.

399
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,357
Okay.

400
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:36,168
I want a place.

401
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,340
41st Street.

402
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:43,843
The pier.

403
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,764
I can take you.

404
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,413
Frank...

405
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:17,084
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

406
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:22,799
You need to call the police, get protective custody.

407
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,968
Get away from this thing.

408
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,220
Get away from me.

409
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,354
Just stay away from me.

410
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,333
911, what is your emergency?

411
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,544
Hello, yes, please.

412
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:02,004
Connect me to the 15th Precinct, please.

413
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,551
Trust me, my men won't disturb us.

414
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,847
Yeah, I don't take much on faith these days.

415
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:18,855
You know, word was you left Hell's Kitchen.

416
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,898
I'm surprised you came back.

417
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,692
What made you think I ever left?

418
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:26,738
The multiple charges pending against you,
drug dealing, money laundering.

419
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:29,115
Oh, yeah, slavery.

420
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,784
That's the reason you come to me?

421
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,453
It's not enough?

422
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,539
I suppose after all this time,
I expected more from you.

423
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,290
Like what?

424
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:43,004
An understanding of the real threat facing this city.

425
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,965
Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'm looking at one.

426
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:51,596
However, tonight I'm only after information.

427
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,556
Perhaps you should ask your police.

428
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,142
I don't want you.

429
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,686
I want your competition.

430
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,649
A heroin dealer with the street name Blacksmith.

431
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,656
And you think I can help you?

432
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:12,199
I know he's been cutting into your territories.

433
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,745
Heroin is illegal.

434
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:21,333
And as far as territories go,
New York is only one of mine.

435
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:25,379
I could have 100 cops here in an hour.

436
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,925
I've grown bored with tea.

437
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:36,599
However, it does seem that our interests
have momentarily aligned.

438
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,521
The heroin being imported by the Blacksmith...

439
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:44,356
is the purest I've seen.

440
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,067
He's also ruthless.

441
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,279
His crew has been systematically eliminating

442
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,533
my chemists and street dealers.

443
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,247
I can end it tonight.

444
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,249
But I need a place to start.

445
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,669
My sources tell me...

446
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,422
his product come in by ship.

447
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,007
Which pier?

448
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:13,010
If I knew that...

449
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,972
this conversation wouldn't be necessary.

450
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:18,224
That's not a lot to go on.

451
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,978
You can be sure his goods will be well-guarded

452
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:25,690
by professionals clearly more capable than my own.

453
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:27,817
Thanks, Madame Gao.

454
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,989
But I fear that the path you've chosen...

455
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,199
isn't going to be an easy one.

456
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,246
Yeah, it never is.

457
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:53,009
- So?
- So...

458
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:56,137
good news is, you're not fired.

459
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,055
But this is strike two.

460
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,350
Um... I protected you in there.

461
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:06,105
All you gotta do is keep your mouth shut,
do your job, and everything will be fine.

462
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,609
- That's it?
- That's it.

463
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:17,033
They're just gonna sweep this all
under the rug, aren't they?

464
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,701
What about Louisa?

465
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:25,416
The story is, Louisa got killed by a junkie.

466
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,920
Got his hands on a scalpel, things got out of hand.

467
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,547
It was very unfortunate,
and could happen to any of us.

468
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:34,759
- You can't possibly be okay with this.
- Claire...

469
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:39,346
There's a body downstairs
being prepped for its second autopsy!

470
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,557
I was willing to take responsibility for what I did,

471
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,935
take whatever punishment that they want to dole out.

472
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,218
- But pretending like it never happened?
- Shh. Come on.

473
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:49,857
Those killers are still out there,
and we're not gonna report that?

474
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:51,734
I've got no way to confirm it,

475
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:56,613
but I'm pretty sure the hospital just
received a major anonymous donation.

476
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:59,325
So, now we're taking hush money?

477
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,744
Shirley, Louisa was one of us.

478
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:05,247
I don't know about you, but I need my job.

479
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,791
Wow.

480
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:09,293
- What?
- Really?

481
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,796
That's how you're gonna play this?

482
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:15,257
Those patients were never formally checked in,

483
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,051
which means there are no records.

484
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,178
The hospital cops aren't talking...

485
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,347
and Louisa's gone.

486
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,307
That makes it your word against the administration's.

487
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,728
And believe me, that is a fight you cannot win.

488
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,146
You already got two strikes.

489
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,523
- Yeah.
- Wait. No, Claire!

490
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:33,192
Claire, wait--

491
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,236
Let's just call this strike three, shall we?

492
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,989
- Ms. Temple--
- I'm not sure exactly when this hospital

493
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:41,200
became more concerned with private donations

494
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,869
or saving our own asses.

495
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:43,995
But just an FYI,

496
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:48,499
it used to be a place where
job number one... was saving lives.

497
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,543
I won't be any part of this.

498
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,924
- I'm out.
- Claire.

499
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:39,425
Multiple shots.

500
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,137
I got no idea where they're coming from.
No.

501
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:46,265
And our outside perimeter's not gonna--

502
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,948
You still here, chickenshit?

503
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,409
It's just you and me now.

504
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:50,329
You hiding?
Huh, you afraid?

505
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,558
Looks like you're all out.

506
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:56,353
That's all you got, huh?

507
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:03,860
The cash, the shit...
Just take it. Take it all.

508
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:08,199
- That what you think's gonna happen, huh?
- Please...

509
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,402
You think you're gonna
talk your way out of this shit?

510
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,463
I've been looking for you.

511
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,508
You're the Blacksmith.

512
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,219
- Say it.
- God, I don't wanna die!

513
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:37,186
Say it.
I want you to tell me.

514
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:39,646
Say, "I'm the Blacksmith."

515
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:47,821
Say, "I'm the Blacksmith.

516
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,449
I killed your wife."

517
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,077
Say it.
Say, "I killed your children."

518
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:55,871
- You feel me?
- I did it, I did it.

519
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:59,333
I'm the Blacksmith.
I'm the one you want.

520
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,045
- Just finish it! Finish it!
- That's what you want.

521
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,470
Here it comes.

522
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,015
- Don't shoot him, Frank! Frank!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

523
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:15,474
Get outta here, Red.

524
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,725
He's lying, Frank.

525
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,060
We're here for the same reasons, all right?

526
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:20,521
I want the Blacksmith just as much as you,
but he's not him.

527
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,564
I know when someone's
telling the truth, Frank. He's not.

528
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,899
Bullshit! Just get outta here!

529
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,276
He's not the man you came for, Frank.

530
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,652
It's me, I swear...

531
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,072
Are you lying to me?

532
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:31,323
Are you lying to me?

533
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:33,117
He's not the Blacksmith.
Put the gun down.

534
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,663
- Either way...
- You kill him, we have nothing.

535
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:38,955
...you die.

536
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,963
You just couldn't let it be, could you?
You just couldn't let it--

537
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:48,632
You kill him, we got nothing, Frank.

538
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,305
Castle's on board.

539
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,932
Get back to the boat now.

540
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:01,103
When are you gonna learn?

541
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:03,980
Mind your own goddamn business!

542
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:06,025
Goddamn it, Frank.

543
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:09,361
- We want the same thing.
- That's bullshit. That's--

544
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,990
I don't want to fight you.
I don't want to fight you.

545
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:15,867
You want me to take it easy?

546
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,594
Stay down, Frank.

547
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:37,639
I'm so sick of you.

548
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,362
Get off me!

549
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,949
Just couldn't let me have it, could you?

550
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,244
You just couldn't let me have it.

551
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:00,537
One second in peace.

552
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:02,789
It was right there.
You had to sweep in.

553
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:04,833
You feel good about yourself?

554
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,003
Piece of shit.

555
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:10,214
Oh, come on, Frank.

556
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:13,008
It wouldn't have been the truth, and you know it.

557
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:14,385
I can't let you start a war

558
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:16,803
- for the wrong reasons.
- Maybe a war is what I need.

559
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,556
Maybe I need that.

560
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:23,310
These people, they took my children from me.

561
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:25,437
They killed my kids!
Don't you get that?

562
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:27,356
Then do right by them!

563
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:30,109
Help me. Work with me
to find the man who gave the order.

564
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:32,153
And then what, Red?
We gonna--

565
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:35,239
We gonna bring him in for justice?
Is that what we're gonna do?

566
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:37,324
Your way's bullshit, Red.
It doesn't work.

567
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:40,286
I need him... I need him gone.
It's gotta be permanent!

568
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:42,089
- It's gotta be finished!
- I... I understand.

569
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:43,705
You're right.
My way isn't working.

570
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:46,750
So, maybe just this once...

571
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,296
Maybe...

572
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:53,840
yeah, your way is what it's gonna take.

573
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,843
Red, just this once?

574
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,721
No. No, no, no, no, no, Red.
That's...

575
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:02,808
that's not how it works.

576
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,353
It's just...

577
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,731
you cross over to my side of the line...

578
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:13,319
you don't get to come back from that.

579
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,321
Not ever.

580
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,702
I count ten. Armed.

581
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,310
There's a lot of gunpowder below decks.

582
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:32,213
Any of these guys starts shooting, this whole ship--

583
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:33,797
It'll blow straight to hell.

584
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,550
We gotta get off this boat before they open fire.

585
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,177
You're goddamn right you do.

586
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,144
We got him.

587
00:44:48,229 --> 00:44:50,564
One batch, two batch...

588
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:52,065
penny and dime.

589
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:56,237
Here I come.
Here I come.

590
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,280
Been a long time, hasn't it, Frank?

591
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:00,782
Kill him.

592
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:33,440
- Just got word from Midtown.
- Who'd she get?

593
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:35,276
The Frenchman.

594
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,279
Jacques screwed the pooch.

595
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:40,238
What an asshole.

596
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,701
Now Ellie's on the war path, working her way up.

597
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:48,372
You know, sooner or later, she'll find you.

598
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,749
Kid's always been a doer.

599
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,250
Follow me.

600
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,131
A guy once told me there's a power in surrender.

601
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,884
In choosing when your time's up.

602
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,178
But I chose.

603
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:09,225
Now, that asshole's dead.

604
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:13,564
I want you outta here.

605
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:17,150
If there's gonna be a tomorrow for anyone...

606
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:20,612
you gotta follow the plan.

607
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:24,240
Go. Get me what I need.

608
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:22,257
No.

609
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,317
My God...

610
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:50,243
- Brett?
- Be careful, Karen.

611
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,289
Cover these bodies.
Castle said he was coming here?

612
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,832
You sure?

613
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,672
Fifteenth Squad Sergeant to Central.

614
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:05,467
Pier 81 on four-one street.
I need FD and ambulances forthwith,

615
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:08,679
and notify Harbor to respond.
And Narcotics.

616
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:11,139
This could be the largest heroin seizure in years.

617
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:14,309
Frank...

618
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:16,812
Why?

619
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,876
- You heading out?
- Yeah. You?

620
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,211
Yep.

621
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:42,754
Clean bill? Congrats.

622
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:45,507
Yeah, I'm a regular poster boy for health.

623
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:47,258
You going on a trip?

624
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:49,135
Something like that.

625
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:51,555
- I just quit.
- As in, your job?

626
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,808
As in, our mutual friend is gonna
have to get friendly with another nurse,

627
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:57,478
because the next time he needs
help at the hospital, I won't be here.

628
00:48:57,561 --> 00:48:58,854
They're trying to keep

629
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:02,065
what happened last night quiet,
like it never happened.

630
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,693
Oh, wow. What did happen?

631
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,277
Ask your friend.

632
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:08,113
I'm ready.

633
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:56,119
And now, it's ready.

634
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,059
Oh, you need help.

635
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:03,061
Hey, hey!
We need some help here!

636
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:06,522
She found him.

637
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:07,941
She found him.

638
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:10,443
What?

639
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:14,489
She found Stick...

640
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:17,408
and she's gonna kill him.

641
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,830
Who?

642
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,626
Elektra.

643
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,456
Hmm.

644
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,872
We need to talk.

645
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,714
I'm all ears.
