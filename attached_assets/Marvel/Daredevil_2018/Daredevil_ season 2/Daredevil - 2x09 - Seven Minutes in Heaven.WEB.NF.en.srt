1
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:21,189
All right, watch your head.

2
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:28,655
Inmate 5-5-4-6-7.
Fisk, Wilson.

3
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:35,620
Everything off.
Clothing and personal items in the bin.

4
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,923
Newbies wear white.

5
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,467
That's yours.

6
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,624
I deeply regret that it's come to this, Mr. Fisk.

7
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,252
I assure you my firm did everything we could...

8
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,881
but the case against you was,
quite simply, bulletproof.

9
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,136
How is the progress regarding my appeal, Mr. Donovan?

10
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,848
We're making progress, but I have to be honest.

11
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,725
Given the magnitude of charges,

12
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,569
we were lucky we could plead you out at all.

13
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,063
Vanessa, huh?

14
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,400
I've secured a percentage of your
holdings offshore, as requested.

15
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,779
- She wants to come see you.
- She can't.

16
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,531
She must stay where she's safe for the time being.

17
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:39,077
Of course.
She'll have everything she needs.

18
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,080
But with that said, you need to understand

19
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,750
that a good number of your assets
were seized by the government, Mr. Fisk.

20
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,127
Your remaining capital is... limited.

21
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,966
- How long will she be safe for?
- Long enough.

22
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,428
Mr. Fisk, I'm doing everything I can to get you out,

23
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,015
but we're talking about a process
that could take months, maybe years.

24
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,769
In the interim, we need you to keep your head down

25
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:07,021
and avoid trouble while you're in here.

26
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:10,775
The state will jump on any infraction
to shoot down an early release...

27
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,443
to keep you inside.

28
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,446
It's the best move, Mr. Fisk.

29
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,157
In fact, it's the only move.

30
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:30,628
Those you cannot teach to fly, teach to fall faster.

31
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,427
Wilson Fisk.

32
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,847
The boogeyman of crime.

33
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,599
The man who cast a shadow in the dark.

34
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,688
You'll stop reading those eventually.

35
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,068
It's best to accept that real life
is what happens on the inside.

36
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,612
Maybe your life, Mr. Dutton, not mine.

37
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,909
- We never met before, have we?
- No, but your reputation precedes you.

38
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,496
A life of running drugs
buys you that much in New York City.

39
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:10,459
You may have made a name
for yourself on the outside...

40
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:11,753
but I run the big box.

41
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,588
I just wanna make that clear...

42
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,966
in case you get any ideas about stepping up.

43
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,887
- I have no intentions of doing that.
- Cut the shit, fat man.

44
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:25,767
I've known guys like you my whole life.
I killed most of 'em.

45
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,144
You ain't never seen a throne
you didn't wanna sit in.

46
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:31,230
So I'm here to make myself crystal clear.

47
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:33,194
There's only room for one of us in this prison,

48
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,568
and it ain't gonna be you.
Not ever.

49
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,528
Because I'm the kingpin of this bitch.

50
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,366
Catch you later.

51
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,605
Mind if I sit?

52
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,399
Fine.

53
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,528
I won't bother you.
Just wanted to meet.

54
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,032
You know, in here,
guys like us need to stick together.

55
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,994
Guys like us?

56
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:29,205
I was a mortgage analyst on the outside.

57
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,666
Seven figure salary, summer house in the Hamptons.

58
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,670
Just made the wrong deal, crossed the wrong guy.

59
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:38,923
It turned out that his brother was
some bigwig in the Justice Department.

60
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:42,093
Some luck, huh?
Look, what I mean is...

61
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,013
we're not like these savages in here.
That's all.

62
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:53,729
Smart to steer clear of that asshole.

63
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,815
It's not just the guys at his table
that are on his side.

64
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,069
He runs about 80% of the contraband in this place.

65
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:02,473
Most of the guards are in his pocket,
from what I can tell.

66
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,035
The two men you were speaking to.

67
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,578
- Valdez brothers.
- They your friends?

68
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:12,248
Slim pickings in here, but, yeah.

69
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,875
Yeah, they don't talk much.

70
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,879
Let's just say what they did
to get in here was ghastly.

71
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,632
Do they have family?

72
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:26,220
A mother.
She'll be alone for a while.

73
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,311
I wish I had better news, Mr. Fisk, but the appeal--

74
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:36,147
- I didn't ask you here for that.
- Oh.

75
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:39,525
I need you to write down the following.

76
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,238
The office of Caplan and Dayhill...

77
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,200
they have a client, his name is Stewart Finney.

78
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:50,453
- He needs his legal retainer bolstered.
- What?

79
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,912
Andrea Valdez.

80
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,833
She's 62.
She lives in Spanish Harlem.

81
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,586
Needs her rent paid indefinitely.

82
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,216
- What is this?
- Untraceable, if you handle it correctly.

83
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,801
Mr. Fisk, I warned you
about getting involved in the--

84
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,303
Get it done!

85
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:30,534
- Fisk.
- Anything on Dutton?

86
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,618
He and his men haven't emerged from block A today.

87
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,913
No way to get in.
That wing's impenetrable.

88
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,583
For now.

89
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,962
The paper's interesting, though.
Check out the front page.

90
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,925
The Punisher.

91
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,761
Apparently, he gunned down the Irish in a big way.

92
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,639
Mmm, Nesbitt was a problematic leader.

93
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,182
He took out the Dogs of Hell, too.

94
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,906
Blew up their clubhouse.
They charged him with 37 counts of murder.

95
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,480
Wow, perhaps his name suits him.

96
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,401
I'd say. Rumor is some of the Cartel
got meat hooks through their faces.

97
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,822
- The Cartel?
- The Mexicans.

98
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,451
If I'm correct...

99
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,414
Dutton didn't do business with the Cartel.

100
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:26,674
On the 22nd, Dutton's lieutenant mentioned...

101
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:31,387
a deal with the Aryans
to move product in the Dogs' territory.

102
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,721
A hostile takeover.

103
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,893
Does Dutton have connections with the Irish?

104
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,757
Some heroin deal gone south.
That was a while back, though.

105
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,652
I know what I'm asking for will be difficult.

106
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,073
I'm not worried about difficult.
I'm not even worried about illegal.

107
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,533
Your funds have almost been depleted.

108
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,161
Building up your little protection crew wasn't cheap.

109
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,995
Nor should it be.

110
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,666
Your cash is almost gone.
If I do this, that's it.

111
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,420
After that, anything you need
for the rest of your stay,

112
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,840
you'll be dipping into the reserves,
into Vanessa's protection.

113
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,426
I won't need anything after this.

114
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,642
This guard you've spoken to,

115
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,730
do I want to know what you'll be asking him to do?

116
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,178
I see you got my message.

117
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,123
Shh, I've got you, Matthew.

118
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,788
Who's... who's there?

119
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:03,682
Elektra?

120
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,939
Oh, slowly.

121
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,068
You okay?

122
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,657
Where is he?

123
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,911
- Stick? He left. Remember?
- No, not Stick.

124
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,371
The boy.

125
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,749
The one you killed.

126
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,211
- It's been taken care of.
- Not "it."

127
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,464
He.

128
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:38,592
Well, he tried to kill you.

129
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,220
He was scared.
He was just a kid.

130
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:47,726
If you'd spared him, he would've sent
his big brothers after us.

131
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,103
I killed him in self-defense.

132
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,523
Even your precious court of law
would say that's legitimate--

133
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,857
It doesn't work that way.

134
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,986
Well... it's a good thing I'm not on trial.

135
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:03,784
- We need to tell the police.
- Tell them what?

136
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:07,538
I killed a member
of an ancient organization of ninjas

137
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,249
that are digging a giant hole in midtown Manhattan?

138
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:14,169
Perhaps we should.
Maybe they need a laugh.

139
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,507
But you and I, we've seen it.

140
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,594
The Hand is very real.

141
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,890
And they know we're onto them.
The battle has begun, Matthew.

142
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,435
There's nothing we can do about it now but fight.

143
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,061
Look...

144
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,733
I wish I could tell you that
I'm not going to pull my sword...

145
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,736
- but I will if I have to.
- You said you wanted to be good.

146
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,741
- I do.
- But you don't.

147
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,869
I saw it ten years ago with Roscoe Sweeney...

148
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,788
and I saw it again last night.

149
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,125
Your adrenaline spiked, Elektra.

150
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,335
You enjoy killing.

151
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:03,969
And you may say you wanna be good for me,
but that's not who you really are, is it?

152
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,772
The first time I took a life...

153
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,816
I was 12 years old.

154
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,447
I did it of my own volition.

155
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,242
I wasn't saving another.

156
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,703
I wasn't even protecting myself.

157
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,667
I did it...

158
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,669
because I needed to know that I could.

159
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,339
Not that I could get away with it.

160
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:45,886
Not that I could get used to it.

161
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,265
And you enjoyed it.

162
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,317
You know, Stick taught us
to never let anyone get close.

163
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,826
- I fell in love with you.
- I loved you, too.

164
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,329
That wasn't a lie.

165
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,958
I fell in love with you, so I don't want
to keep judging you for who you are.

166
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,838
And this... this is who I am.

167
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,468
We have to stop corrupting each other.

168
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,186
We can't do this anymore.

169
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,817
Say something.

170
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,363
The Hand will decimate your city.

171
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,828
Not if I stop them.

172
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,540
- You'll die.
- Yeah, maybe.

173
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,376
But this is a war I need to fight alone.

174
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:06,675
Goodbye, Elektra.

175
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:30,073
The circumstances are unfortunate,
but each loss brings opportunity.

176
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,661
- I'm glad we have this chance to meet.
- Hmm.

177
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,205
You have something you wanna say to me?

178
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,043
I've been following your case...

179
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:45,964
as much as one could in this cage.

180
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:53,346
I want you to know...
what happened to your family that day--

181
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,515
Don't you do that.

182
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,809
You don't talk about my family.
You got that?

183
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,393
Just don't do it.

184
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,439
- I consider it a tragedy.
- That right?

185
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,984
You can save your bullshit sympathy,
'cause I don't buy it.

186
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,028
I understand why you'd think that.

187
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,282
Look, you got something to say to me or not?

188
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:17,245
Yes. I've crossed paths
with your attorneys... before.

189
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,499
Needless to say, I'm not a... a huge fan.

190
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,671
Pushing you towards a sentence
in a mental health facility,

191
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,799
after everything you've been through,
that would have been a travesty.

192
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,427
- As opposed to what?
- Closure.

193
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,348
Since I've been incarcerated,

194
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:40,894
I've developed an empathy towards those
who suffer by the hand of the law.

195
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,480
I think I've heard enough of your bullshit, okay?

196
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,775
You said closure.
What'd you mean?

197
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:54,032
There's a man, here, in the big box.

198
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,706
He's a prisoner.

199
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,959
He's been overheard...

200
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:08,380
boasting about his involvement
with several criminal factions.

201
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:15,512
This man... he most definitely had a hand
in the massacre in the park.

202
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,141
I want a name.

203
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,061
- He's in another cell block...
- I didn't ask you that.

204
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,606
...which he essentially owns,

205
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,525
heavily guarded by guards and inmates alike.

206
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,528
- I don't give a shit. I want a name.
- Dutton.

207
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:37,242
He's not Irish.
He's not Cartel.

208
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,952
He's not a biker.

209
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,206
He's something else entirely.

210
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,502
I believe that he facilitated the deal...

211
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,298
between the three groups that you've been targeting.

212
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,590
What's in it for you?

213
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,844
He controls much of this prison...

214
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:00,849
which has... made my life here...

215
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,477
difficult.

216
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,897
So why haven't you done it yourself?

217
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,692
'Cause, Mr. Castle,
unlike most of the population here,

218
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,568
my plan is to keep my head down,

219
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,947
so I can get out... in the foreseeable future.

220
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,005
- They with you?
- Yeah, something like that.

221
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,082
That right?

222
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:38,261
Well, I don't help shitbag, has-been mob bosses.

223
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,263
- "Has-been"?
- You heard what I said.

224
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,653
- I'm simply proposing an arrangement.
- I don't do arrangements.

225
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,656
You should rethink that...

226
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:01,409
considering the amount of enemies you have in here.

227
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,370
I'm not gonna be your goddamn trigger man.

228
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,873
- I'm not doing it.
- I'm offering you the opportunity

229
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:10,585
to confront the man implicated
in the deaths of your family.

230
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,463
Yes, I benefit from your actions.

231
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,719
But the tide raises all ships, Mr. Castle.

232
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:25,642
If, for some reason, my involvement
diminishes your passion for answers...

233
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,227
for revenge...

234
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,563
well, that's your choice.

235
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:35,027
But the war you waged on New York City...

236
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,821
it got you nowhere.

237
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:45,620
I'm offering you something... no one else could.

238
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,418
If you don't want my help, fine.

239
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,671
By all means...

240
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:56,840
enjoy prison.

241
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:01,762
How would it work?

242
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,104
My resources here are limited,

243
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:15,025
but I can assure you safe passage to cell block A...

244
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:19,071
which is run by Dutton and his men.

245
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,658
Guards have a shift change at 1500 hours.

246
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,286
Dutton's men will be in their cells.
We can get you to him.

247
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,996
We have one guard on our side, but you'll only have

248
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,541
a seven-minute window to reach Dutton,
get your answers and get out.

249
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,168
I assume that gives you enough time.

250
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,462
- When?
- Does that mean you'll do it?

251
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,422
- When?
- Today.

252
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,179
After this, you and me, we're done.

253
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,014
Yes, we're done.

254
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,858
The shiv is the best I can offer.

255
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,194
Something tells me you'll make do.

256
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,745
Hey.

257
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:13,541
- You're hurt?
- What makes you say that?

258
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,254
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

259
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:20,798
We need to talk.

260
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:24,011
It's not a great time, Foggy.

261
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:28,015
Never is. Not lately.
And that's the point, so I'll be brief.

262
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,600
I think we should shutter the office for a few weeks.

263
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,436
It may be drastic,
but after everything that just happened,

264
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,605
we need to think about our priorities.

265
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,191
To decide how to proceed with Nelson and Murdock.

266
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:44,114
Are you talking about our firm...
or you talking about our friendship?

267
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,824
For a while, they went hand-in-hand.

268
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,163
I think you're right.

269
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,541
I think putting some distance between us is smart.

270
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:59,212
What?
Isn't that what you wanted?

271
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:05,177
What I wanted... was time for us to rethink things--

272
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,220
Time isn't gonna change who I am, or what I do.

273
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:08,931
- I don't want to talk about that--
- Yes, you do.

274
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,183
- That's why you came.
- I came to talk to my friend,

275
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,935
not the vigilante.

276
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,978
They're the same person, Foggy.

277
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:18,898
They weren't always.

278
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,404
Either way... I have to do this.

279
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,533
As we speak, there are horrible things
happening in this city.

280
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,952
Of course.

281
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,911
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, so...

282
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:35,707
You don't get to create danger,
and then protect us from that danger.

283
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,418
That's not heroic.

284
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,962
That's insane.

285
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,296
We were really close

286
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,799
to winning the Frank Castle case
and getting that guy the help he needed.

287
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,260
I don't know what tanked it,
but I know we had a shot,

288
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:51,014
mostly because I worked my ass off to cover for you.

289
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:54,559
- I deserve better than that.
- I know.

290
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,605
Every time I walk up those stairs...

291
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,088
I wonder if today is the day
you're dead in your living room.

292
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,151
I'm not gonna stop, Foggy.

293
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:04,861
Not anytime soon.

294
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:09,282
And to be honest, I'm done
apologizing to you for who I am.

295
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:14,537
If I'm holding you back, then you should
consider closing the office for good.

296
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:18,291
You can start over without the stuff
that gets in your way.

297
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,461
Without me.

298
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:26,424
- That's not what I came to say.
- But it's what I'm saying.

299
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,303
What am I supposed to tell Karen?

300
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:36,309
I don't know.
Same thing I'm telling you.

301
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,479
You're better off without me.

302
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:47,237
See you around, Matt.

303
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,532
Take care of yourself.

304
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,547
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I... I never set an alarm.

305
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,215
I never need to, but, uh...

306
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,678
let's be honest, it's been, uh... quite the week.

307
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,184
What's going on?

308
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,438
- Packing up.
- The Castle files?

309
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,273
Are you hungry?
Let's get some food.

310
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,733
Thanks to Frank Castle, anyone that was
gonna walk through those doors

311
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:26,859
is now gonna go elsewhere.

312
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,778
Actually, can I show you something?

313
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:37,329
We should take a long lunch.
We need to talk.

314
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:41,374
Yeah, yeah, we should.
Um... do you remember John Doe?

315
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,210
The report the... the medical examiner falsified?

316
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,044
Nope. Totally blocked it.

317
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,715
Um... well, I think I...
I found something pretty big here.

318
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,509
- Whose house did you break into this time?
- No need.

319
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,679
It's just press passes and NYPD files and, um...

320
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,975
So these pictures are all from the day
Frank's family was killed.

321
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,519
I've seen enough bloody bodies to last me a lifetime.

322
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,855
- Can we please just--
- Just a sec.

323
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,692
Okay, um... look.

324
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,864
- All right, you see him?
- Sure do.

325
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,033
Now look.

326
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,870
Maybe he was bagged and tagged already?

327
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,080
Right, well, that's what I thought, but... I checked

328
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,844
and I couldn't find any death certificate.

329
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:25,001
Whoever he was, it's like he was never there.

330
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,545
Foggy, look. He was.

331
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,673
He was there.
What if he is our John Doe?

332
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,050
Karen... let it go.

333
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:35,262
The trial is over.

334
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:40,225
Wait.

335
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,685
No, no, nothing has changed.

336
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,103
There is still a conspiracy.
I mean, this...

337
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:46,481
this guy could be the key to exposing the cover-up.

338
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,651
Maybe. Somebody else's problem now.

339
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,111
What... But just like that?
I don't--

340
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:55,490
We're lawyers.
I got bigger things to worry about.

341
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:58,326
Like what? Like... like getting
Nelson and Murdock back on top?

342
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,205
- This would do that.
- There is no Nelson and Murdock.

343
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,541
Look around.

344
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,212
Okay. You and Matt, you fought at the courthouse.

345
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,714
You weren't your best selves,
but none of us have been for a long time--

346
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,758
I was my best self that day...

347
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,386
at the courthouse, covering for him.
And so were you.

348
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,347
You're eerily good at this stuff.

349
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,723
But Matt has--

350
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,350
He's...

351
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:25,228
He's got other things to take care of.

352
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,986
All right, when I went over
to his apartment the other day...

353
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,657
to get him to come to the trial, there...

354
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,870
there was a... a woman there, in his bed.

355
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,792
Okay, no. You know, whatever...

356
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,712
Whatever is going on with Matt, he's...

357
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,381
he's either not capable or... or not willing

358
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:57,219
to make room for anything else
in his life... right now.

359
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,513
I should've warned you.

360
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,436
No. No, you shouldn't have.

361
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,605
Look...

362
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:12,650
if Matt doesn't wanna share his life
with me, that is between me and him.

363
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,778
The same way that your friendship
with Matt is between you and him.

364
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,781
I don't need to be warned, Foggy, I just...

365
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,992
I cannot be lied to anymore.

366
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,246
All I want is the truth about something.

367
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,457
I get it.

368
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:32,003
I'll give you a call if something changes...

369
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,673
but for now I suggest that...

370
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:40,262
both of us start thinking
about a life outside this office.

371
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,220
Oh, God.

372
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:26,098
Come on. Shit, shit, shit.
Come on, come on.

373
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,100
You don't want to do that, Stan.

374
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,186
Don't... don't move.

375
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,855
You're an accountant.

376
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,358
A greedy one, yes...

377
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:39,153
but something tells me, even if you
take that shot, you're gonna miss.

378
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,365
And trust me... you don't wanna miss.

379
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,950
I'm not like them.

380
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:48,330
- Who?
- I don't do what they do.

381
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:52,124
- Are you talking about the Hand?
- Yes.

382
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,002
Put the gun down.

383
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,806
How do I know you're not working with them--

384
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,258
I didn't say anything.
Please, I didn't say anything.

385
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:04,512
That's the problem, Stan.
What do you know about the Hand?

386
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:07,056
I don't. Please, I'd rather die.

387
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,933
Well, that's not gonna help anyone.

388
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:12,061
They destroy everything that gets in their way.

389
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:14,647
The Roxxon Corporation...

390
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:20,277
the secret room... the ledger, the dirt, the hole.

391
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:23,823
I know about it all, Stan.
I need to know what they're planning.

392
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,326
Planning? It's already been done.

393
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,244
- What's been done?
- Nothing!

394
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,204
I'll protect you.

395
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,833
They have my son.

396
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,293
They took Daniel!

397
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,296
I don't know what they're doing to him.

398
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:46,012
These bodyguards weren't protecting me.
They were holding me hostage.

399
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:51,559
If I tell you anything... they will kill my son.

400
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,904
- Where are they holding him?
- Some kind of drug operation.

401
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:06,824
I don't know what they're doing there.
They call it the Farm.

402
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:10,077
- Take me there.
- I've thought about it...

403
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:11,454
but it's a fortress.

404
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:16,083
- It's impossible to get inside.
- Take me there.

405
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,221
Karen Page.

406
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,600
Well, you guys had a hell of a day in court.

407
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,102
Front row seats to the trial of the decade.

408
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,729
Did you bring me a T-shirt?

409
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,065
No. Uh...

410
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,359
I might have something better.

411
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:43,861
These are from the NYPD files

412
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,072
- from Castle's family's autopsy report.
- Mmm-hmm.

413
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:49,659
- Um... so, here... you can see here--
- The... the body and here...

414
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,953
the body's gone.
Is this some sort of test?

415
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,830
Well, I... I think this is the John Doe

416
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,915
the medical examiner said he covered up.

417
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:59,461
- Said when?
- During the Frank Castle trial.

418
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:01,879
Tepper's testimony wasn't public.

419
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:05,467
Oh, my God. Sorry, they...
they cleared the courtroom.

420
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,218
I was one of a handful of people who heard it.

421
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,179
Okay, so we... we identify John Doe,

422
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,932
and then we find out why
he was important enough to hide.

423
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,602
Uh... you know what?
Actually, I think that, um...

424
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,854
I think you should do this.

425
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,648
- Trial's over.
- So?

426
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:23,275
So, Frank is in prison,

427
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,237
and everyone's retreated to their corners,
including my bosses,

428
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,073
one of whom has repeatedly told me
to let it go and move on.

429
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,784
And do you... do you wanna move on?

430
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,328
Case is closed.

431
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,413
Castle tanked his own case.
He got put away.

432
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:37,957
I just think you should carry the torch on this.

433
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,460
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

434
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,630
Okay, so...
I just wanna rewind this informal meeting

435
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,465
- we're having by about 30 seconds.
- What?

436
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:48,968
You come to me with a lead, with a...
a really good lead, right?

437
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,887
And now you just wanna take off?
Right?

438
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,305
I mean, it's... it's sort of like
a pitcher going to the 8th inning

439
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:54,932
with a no-hit shutout, and just walking away.

440
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:57,894
Look, this was supposed to be about
saving my law firm, and I didn't--

441
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,312
I get that. At first, yeah.

442
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:03,065
But I have to tell you, in the last week,
I've gotten about ten phone calls

443
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,549
from people wanting to know
where I'm getting my information.

444
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:08,488
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

445
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,157
What'd you tell 'em?

446
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,617
What do you think I told 'em?
I took all the credit.

447
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,868
But the point is...

448
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,411
...that when my phone starts ringing like that,

449
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,335
that means that you're shaking the right trees.

450
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,041
So, yeah, uh, sure.
I mean, the... the case is closed.

451
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:23,252
Frank Castle's in prison.
But this thing ain't over.

452
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,379
Not yet. Not by a long shot.

453
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,049
You know it.
'Cause you know you're on to something.

454
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,972
- Yeah, okay, okay.
- Okay. All right, so, um...

455
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,891
I pull some strings, we, um...

456
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:40,102
find out the last known address
of medical examiner Tepper,

457
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:43,147
and maybe he'll be more willing to have
a conversation outside of the courtroom,

458
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,107
away from the icy death gaze of Frank Castle.

459
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,358
No, but wait.
Talk to who?

460
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:47,482
- Whom.
- Wait, talk to me?

461
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,236
- I--
- No, no, no. To us.

462
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,863
Karen, to us.

463
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,907
And don't get cocky.
You're not that good yet.

464
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,283
Got a long time to go.

465
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:12,509
Cell 305. Room with a view.

466
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,638
Seven minutes, and that's it.

467
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:52,216
...makes the grab, so a wasted single by Young

468
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,425
somehow sends it into...

469
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:54,677
Twelve.

470
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:58,848
Prick's 200 light.
Rat-faced son of a bitch.

471
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,609
You and me, we gotta talk.

472
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,116
This is it. The Farm.

473
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,953
- Stay here.
- I'm coming with you.

474
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,872
He's my son.

475
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:26,125
You wanna be alive to see him?
Stay here.

476
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,297
Doctor? Doctor, my name's Karen Page, I...

477
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:38,512
Sir, I know your testimony in the case
against Frank Castle hurt your career.

478
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,349
I think I can help you.

479
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,519
But I also think there are other people involved

480
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,521
who could really use your help.

481
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,780
I remember you.

482
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,282
You were with the defense.

483
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,119
- I'm not with them now.
- We're with the New York Bulletin.

484
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,371
Please.

485
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,504
After what happened at the courthouse,

486
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,925
the mayor asked me to step down.

487
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:19,011
I know I sound paranoid, but...

488
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,973
there have been people following me.

489
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:24,641
You're a target because of what you know.

490
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:28,020
'Cause whatever that is,
they... they want to keep in the dark.

491
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:32,233
Karen has found something
that will bring the truth to light.

492
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:33,609
Here, uh...

493
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,946
This... is this the body
they asked you to make disappear?

494
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,824
- I shouldn't be talking to you.
- I understand you're afraid.

495
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,034
You can either continue to be trapped
by what you've done

496
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:43,995
or you can tell us what you know

497
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:45,955
so that we can go out and expose the real bad guys.

498
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,082
And then you can get back to living
your life, because...

499
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,252
this place is not where your story ends.

500
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,885
That's him.

501
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:01,888
- That's the John Doe.
- Okay, um...

502
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:03,890
Uh, did he have a wallet?

503
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,850
Uh, what about any... any identifying marks?

504
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:09,395
- Scars? Tattoos? Any--
- I tell you this...

505
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,817
you have to substantiate it
before you print a word of it.

506
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:16,235
Of course.

507
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,322
All right, he didn't have a name,

508
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:23,200
but tucked inside his left shoe,
he did have something.

509
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,912
- What?
- A police call sign.

510
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:28,705
A special code.

511
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,750
Look, John Doe wasn't a criminal,

512
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:34,628
and he wasn't some innocent bystander
in the park, either.

513
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,505
He was an undercover cop.

514
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,927
Jesus.

515
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,931
Now, you make any noise, anything at all,
I'm gonna open you up like a bag.

516
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,391
I'll watch you bleed out all over this floor.

517
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,894
Now, you nod if you understand me.

518
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,604
Okay.

519
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,565
Shh.

520
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,692
Stanton massacre.

521
00:37:56,776 --> 00:38:00,196
The carousel hit.
I hear you were there.

522
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,738
What if I was?

523
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:06,077
You're a goddamn lunatic.

524
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,829
What the hell were you doing there?

525
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,916
Drug deal.

526
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:14,168
I was brokering between three groups of assholes

527
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,651
who barely spoke the same language.

528
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,713
- What happened?
- What do you think happened?

529
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:19,631
- Tell me who started the shooting.
- What?

530
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,593
You tell me who pulled the trigger.
Who made the order?

531
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,470
- It went south.
- What do you mean, "It went south"?

532
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,263
- It happens.
- What does that mean, "It went south"?

533
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:27,348
What do you mean?

534
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:30,517
It means we're not as dumb as they thought we were.

535
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:33,770
- We realized what it was.
- What was it?

536
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:37,108
It wasn't a massacre, asshole.
It was a sting.

537
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:41,112
- A what?
- My source warned me.

538
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,655
The feds infiltrated one of the gangs.
I'm not sure which.

539
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:47,784
They found out how big the deal was.
Massive exchange.

540
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,288
A real game changer.
But they weren't after any of us.

541
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:52,748
They were after the man in charge,

542
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:54,791
the man who organized the whole damn thing.

543
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:56,460
Who's that?
Who is that? I want a name.

544
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:57,628
I never met him.

545
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,256
He never showed his face.

546
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,842
All I know is he had a line on pure heroin.

547
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,511
Shit shipped from the Middle East.

548
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:08,014
They called him the Blacksmith.

549
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,101
The whole thing should've went
by the numbers, but he got wise.

550
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,769
He stayed away.

551
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,980
And when they realized he wasn't gonna show,

552
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,315
someone started shooting.
That's all I know.

553
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,568
I swear... to God.

554
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:28,284
I heard about you.

555
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,702
News travels fast around here.

556
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,706
But there were almost 100 bangers that day,

557
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,667
and every finger found a trigger.

558
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,296
You know, this crusade of yours...

559
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,965
it's never gonna end, right?

560
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,092
Right?

561
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:52,766
Yeah... yeah, you're right.

562
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,727
You're right.

563
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,006
Open the door.

564
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,467
Open the door.

565
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,266
What are you doing?

566
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,477
Open the goddamn door.

567
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,563
Hey. Hey.

568
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:42,191
Mr. Castle...

569
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,151
thank you.

570
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,694
I couldn't have done it without you.

571
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,989
- They got Dutton!
- Holy shit, man!

572
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:51,283
There he is. There he is.
You're a dead man.

573
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,869
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

574
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:57,164
Come on. You're dead!

575
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:43,645
Inmate! Fall on your knees!

576
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:00,036
Open up!

577
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:10,506
Not strong enough.

578
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,299
Hai.

579
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,931
Mmm.

580
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:21,767
We found two guards unconscious

581
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,893
in the Roxxon garage.

582
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,520
What were they protecting?

583
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,230
Stan Gibson, sir.

584
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:30,651
Find him.
The process is almost complete.

585
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:45,374
Tell your man to stand down.

586
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,751
Don't shoot.
Lower the gun.

587
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:50,171
Lower the gun!

588
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:04,976
There are more men outside.

589
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,063
Not conscious ones.

590
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,691
Tell me about the Farm.

591
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,027
What are you growing here?

592
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,202
I am not afraid to hurt you.

593
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:22,786
I know you're not.

594
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:27,708
But you are not the only devil
who will walk these streets.

595
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,882
- What's in the basement?
- The rising is coming.

596
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:38,719
You are but one man, akuma-san.

597
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:41,847
You cannot stop what we have started.

598
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,644
What is that?

599
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,110
That's blood.

600
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:58,697
It wasn't just a random gang shootout.
It was a sting.

601
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,867
- Who knows who's involved?
- Cops, DA's office, obviously.

602
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,871
- The mayor? How high does this go?
- I don't know.

603
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,373
But I can tell by that look in your eye

604
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:10,083
that you're not gonna get any rest
till you figure it out.

605
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:13,086
So if you wanna camp out in here...

606
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:15,922
it's all yours.

607
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,301
Start digging.

608
00:45:22,346 --> 00:45:25,015
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

609
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:03,804
Ben was the best researcher I've ever known.

610
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:05,681
I remember.

611
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:18,193
- Did you--
- Read that? Yes. Yeah, I... I read it.

612
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:21,237
Look, Ben didn't care, and I don't, either.

613
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:30,163
Get to work, okay?

614
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:22,132
Go.

615
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:23,550
Are you sure that's a good idea, Mr. Fisk?

616
00:47:23,634 --> 00:47:24,968
Go now!

617
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,481
How quickly we turn into savages.

618
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,693
As if the moment we walk through these prison doors--

619
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:43,779
You tried to have me killed.

620
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:47,073
Yes, it would've been cleaner that way,
but you got what you wanted!

621
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:48,784
Given the condition that he was in,

622
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:54,122
I assume that Dutton admitted
to some involvement in your tragedy.

623
00:48:01,547 --> 00:48:05,216
What do you want?
Why am I still alive?

624
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:08,637
Because plans change.

625
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,264
Because if you want to survive, you adapt.

626
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:16,478
Yes! The plan was to kill you.
I needed to close that loop.

627
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:19,981
I'd already made a deal with the rest of the guards.

628
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:22,734
I doubled the cut that Dutton was paying them.

629
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:26,488
But that didn't work out, did it?
No, I was wrong.

630
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:30,408
That's difficult to admit, but...

631
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:35,872
you have a gift, Mr. Castle.

632
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:40,043
I assumed that the stories that I read in the paper

633
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:45,131
about your attacks on the criminal world
were apocryphal.

634
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:47,884
How could one man be capable of such...

635
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:50,637
violence?

636
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,181
But then I saw it...

637
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,268
with my own two eyes.

638
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:03,900
And when one comes across someone with such talent...

639
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:06,444
with such a gift... well...

640
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:10,448
you don't let that go to waste.

641
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:13,201
No.

642
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,912
No, you don't.

643
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,710
How's that?

644
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,573
Release him.

645
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:53,659
- Mr. Fisk, I--
- Do it now!

646
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:11,843
What the hell is this?

647
00:50:12,928 --> 00:50:15,180
I'm in control now.

648
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,974
- And I've set you free.
- What does that mean, "free"?

649
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:20,143
I'll show you.

650
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:23,647
Stay back.

651
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:27,192
'Cause everyone warned me

652
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:30,987
that prison would be an inhumane environment.

653
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,451
It is.
But I... I find it refreshing.

654
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:39,537
The perfect microcosm of the animal world.

655
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:44,751
When an animal wants something,
when it needs something, other things...

656
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:46,419
need to be stepped on.

657
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:50,757
You want me on the outside
so I step on every piece of shit I see.

658
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:54,427
That way, nobody gets strong, and we...
The city's yours for the taking.

659
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,055
Something like that. Yeah.

660
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:58,807
So if you can do that, if you can get me out,

661
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,308
why not just do it yourself?

662
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:03,186
Because I play the long game, Mr. Castle.

663
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,982
You see, when I'm finally let out of this cage...

664
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:11,569
it won't be to wage war.
It will be to win one.

665
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:17,325
You, sir... you need to focus on now.

666
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:22,122
I've given you a chance to walk free.

667
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:25,876
To put that gift of yours to work, to find...

668
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:28,003
What does Dutton call him?

669
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:30,505
The Blacksmith.

670
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,425
If I were in your shoes...

671
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:37,929
I would use this opportunity to find your justice,

672
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:40,891
to kill your way to justice!

673
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:45,353
And not for me. Of course not.
Not for yourself.

674
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:49,565
For your family.

675
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:53,069
For them.

676
00:51:57,658 --> 00:51:58,659
Fisk.

677
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:01,369
Yes?

678
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,708
You know...

679
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:09,502
next time I see you...

680
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:12,588
only one of us walks away.

681
00:52:13,674 --> 00:52:15,383
Yes, of course.

682
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:18,053
I'm counting on it.

683
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,961
- Is someone there?
- Someone...

684
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:17,779
These people...

685
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:24,327
Jesus.

686
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:38,716
What are they doing to you?

687
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:48,226
Daniel. Daniel!

688
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,270
Daniel. Oh, Daniel!

689
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,563
We're gonna get them out.
Stan, we're gonna get them all out.

690
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:53,648
Daniel, my boy.

691
00:53:54,983 --> 00:53:58,444
Oh, my boy. Oh, my boy.

692
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,490
Keys.

693
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:06,661
Just hold on, my son.

694
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,843
Come here. Thank God.

695
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:25,513
Thank God. God.

696
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:29,392
Get down!

697
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,481
They weren't finished.

698
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:48,619
The physician says that your condition is...

699
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:50,914
is grave.

700
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,543
That your lungs are filling with liquid.

701
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:02,843
In a few hours, you're likely
to suffocate in your own blood.

702
00:55:07,222 --> 00:55:11,059
But you won't suffer alone.
I'll be here.

703
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,979
Because you were right.

704
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:20,735
In prison, there's only room for one kingpin.

705
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:56,664
You still have scars to remember me by, I hope.

706
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,415
Wait...

707
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:43,836
You're dead.

708
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,883
There is no such thing.
