1
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,543
Wait for it.

2
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,463
- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.

3
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,470
Jane, you can't keep doing this.

4
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,308
The last 17 occurrences
have been predictable to the second.

5
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,894
Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.

6
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,812
I'm telling you, there's a connection

7
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,690
between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.

8
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:52,361
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you to fly
out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.

9
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,821
Jane?

10
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,490
I think you want to see this.

11
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,995
What is that?

12
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,005
I thought you said
it was a subtle aurora!

13
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,256
Go!

14
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,516
- Get closer.
- Right. Good one.

15
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,683
Go!

16
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,661
What are you doing?

17
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,831
I am not dying for six college credits!

18
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,770
I think that was legally your fault.

19
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,355
Get the first aid kit.

20
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,107
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

21
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,483
Please.

22
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,323
Where did he come from?

23
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:42,680
Once, mankind accepted
a simple truth,

24
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,434
that they were not alone
in this universe.

25
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:52,440
Some worlds man believed
to be home to their gods.

26
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,526
Others, they knew to fear.

27
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,868
From a realm of cold and darkness
came the Frost Giants,

28
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,761
threatening to plunge the mortal world
into a new ice age.

29
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,188
But humanity
would not face this threat alone.

30
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:13,104
Our armies drove the Frost Giants
back into the heart of their own world.

31
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,734
The cost was great.

32
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,447
In the end, their king fell.

33
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:31,122
And the source of their power
was taken from them.

34
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,291
With the last great war ended,

35
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,713
we withdrew from the other worlds
and returned home

36
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,965
to the Realm Eternal,

37
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,968
Asgard.

38
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,252
Here we remain as a beacon of hope,

39
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,173
shining out across the stars.

40
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,552
And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,

41
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:32,224
it was Asgard and its warriors

42
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,768
that brought peace

43
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,519
to the universe.

44
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,234
But the day will come

45
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,112
when one of you

46
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,032
will have to defend that peace.

47
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,951
Do the Frost Giants still live?

48
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,286
When I'm king,

49
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,290
I'll hunt the monsters down
and slay them all!

50
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,959
Just as you did, Father.

51
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,087
A wise king

52
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,257
never seeks out war.

53
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,681
But he must always be ready for it.

54
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,946
- I'm ready, Father.
- So am I.

55
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,908
Only one of you can ascend
to the throne.

56
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,995
But both of you were born to be kings.

57
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,101
Oh, please.

58
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,203
Thor Odinson,

59
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,289
my heir,

60
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,252
my firstborn.

61
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:11,508
So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer Mjolnir,

62
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,678
forged in the heart of a dying star,

63
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,015
its power has no equal,

64
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,809
as a weapon to destroy

65
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,103
or as a tool to build.

66
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,398
'Tis a fit companion for a king.

67
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,486
I have defended Asgard

68
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,657
and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms

69
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,117
from the time of the great beginning.

70
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,453
Though the day has come...

71
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,774
Do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms?

72
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,401
I swear.

73
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,696
And do you swear
to preserve the peace?

74
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,281
I swear.

75
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,366
Do you swear

76
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,995
to cast aside all selfish ambition

77
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,956
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the Realms?

78
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,207
I swear!

79
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,876
Then, on this day,

80
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,587
I, Odin Allfather,

81
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,674
proclaim you...

82
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,480
The Frost Giants!

83
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,819
The Jotuns must pay
for what they've done!

84
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,238
They have paid, with their lives.

85
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,408
The Destroyer did its work,

86
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,744
the Casket is safe, and all is well.

87
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,079
All is well?

88
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,624
They broke into the weapons vault!

89
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,293
If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

90
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,629
- They didn't.
- Well, I want to know why!

91
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,634
I have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotuns.

92
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:03,305
He just broke your truce!
They know you are vulnerable!

93
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,349
What action would you take?

94
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,811
March into Jotunheim as you once did.
Teach them a lesson.

95
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,312
Break their spirits

96
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,523
so they'll never dare
try to cross our borders again.

97
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,967
You're thinking only as a warrior.

98
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,234
This was an act of war!

99
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,569
It was the act of but a few,
doomed to fail.

100
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,154
Look how far they got!

101
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,679
We will find the breach in our defenses
and it will be sealed.

102
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,911
As King of Asgard...
But you're not king!

103
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,165
Not yet.

104
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,908
It's unwise to be in my company
right now, Brother.

105
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,829
This was to be my day of triumph.

106
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,374
It'll come.

107
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,960
In time.

108
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,296
What's this?

109
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,884
If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.

110
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,803
About the Frost Giants,
about Laufey, about everything.

111
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,765
If they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defenses once,

112
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,392
who's to say they won't try again?

113
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,519
- Next time with an army.
- Exactly.

114
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,397
There's nothing you can do
without defying Father.

115
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,401
No, no, no. I know that look.

116
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,769
That's the only way
to ensure the safety of our borders.

117
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,863
Thor, it's madness.

118
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,782
Madness? What sort of madness?

119
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,076
We're going to Jotunheim.

120
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,704
What?

121
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,998
This isn't like a journey to Earth

122
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,125
where you summon
a little lightning and thunder,

123
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,878
and the mortals worship you as a god.

124
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,254
This is Jotunheim.

125
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,632
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

126
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,468
defeated their armies
and took their Casket.

127
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,220
We would just be looking for answers.

128
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,596
It is forbidden!

129
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,935
My friends, have you forgotten
all that we have done together?

130
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,062
Fandral, Hogun.

131
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,023
Who led you
into the most glorious of battles?

132
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,983
You did.

133
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,402
And Volstagg,
to delicacies so succulent,

134
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,072
you thought you'd died
and gone to Valhalla?

135
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,491
You did.

136
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,617
Yes!

137
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,661
And who proved wrong
all who scoffed at the idea

138
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,205
that a young maiden could be
one of the fiercest warriors

139
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,329
this realm has ever known?

140
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,374
I did.

141
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,418
True, but I supported you, Sif.

142
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,836
My friends,

143
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,256
we're going to Jotunheim.

144
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,683
You leave this to me.

145
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,979
- Good Heimdall...
- You're not dressed warmly enough.

146
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,188
I'm sorry?

147
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,066
Do you think that you can deceive me?

148
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,095
- You must be mistaken...
- Enough!

149
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,741
Heimdall, may we pass?

150
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:57,331
Never has an enemy slipped my watch
until this day.

151
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,834
I wish to know how that happened.

152
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,545
Then tell no one where we have gone
until we've returned.

153
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,464
Understand?

154
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,095
What happened?
Silver tongue turn to lead?

155
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,183
Be warned.

156
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,854
I will honor my sworn oath
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

157
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,316
If your return
threatens the safety of Asgard,

158
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,777
Bifrost will remain closed to you

159
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,322
and you'll be left to die
in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

160
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,366
Couldn't you just
leave the bridge open for us?

161
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,742
To leave the bridge open

162
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,994
would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost

163
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,081
and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.

164
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,458
I have no plans to die today.

165
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,252
None do.

166
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,799
We shouldn't be here.

167
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,595
Let's move.

168
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,780
Where are they?

169
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,866
Hiding, as cowards always do.

170
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,589
You've come a long way to die,
Asgardians.

171
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,217
I am Thor Odinson!

172
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,302
We know who you are.

173
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,972
How did your people get into Asgard?

174
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,443
The House of Odin is full of traitors.

175
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,029
Do not dishonor my father's name
with your lies!

176
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,950
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

177
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,412
And why have you come here?
To make peace?

178
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,748
You long for battle. You crave it.

179
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,334
You're nothing but a boy

180
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:14,004
trying to prove himself a man.

181
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,717
Well, this "boy"
has grown tired of your mockery.

182
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,851
Thor, stop and think.

183
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,644
Look around you, we're outnumbered.

184
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,438
Know your place, Brother.

185
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:35,108
You know not
what your actions would unleash.

186
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,112
I do.

187
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,992
Go now, while I still allow it.

188
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,006
We will accept your most gracious offer.

189
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,103
Come on, Brother.

190
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,861
Run back home, little princess.

191
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,321
Damn.

192
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,953
Next?

193
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,349
At least make it a challenge for me!

194
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,371
That's more like it.

195
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,283
Don't let them touch you!

196
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,410
Thor!

197
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,789
- We must go!
- Then go!

198
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,022
Run!

199
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,317
Thor!

200
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,384
Heimdall!

201
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,386
Open the bridge!

202
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,537
Father! We'll finish them together!

203
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,039
Silence!

204
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,421
Allfather.

205
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,925
You look weary.

206
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,138
Laufey, end this now.

207
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,266
Your boy sought this out.

208
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,184
You're right.

209
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,730
And these are the actions of a boy,
treat them as such.

210
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,986
You and I can end this here and now,
before there's further bloodshed.

211
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,739
We are beyond diplomacy now,
Allfather.

212
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,493
He'll get what he came for.

213
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,619
War

214
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,705
and death.

215
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,833
So be it.

216
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,524
Why did you bring us back?

217
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,044
Do you realize what you've done?
What you've started?

218
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,154
- I was protecting my home.
- You cannot even protect your friends!

219
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,989
How can you hope
to protect a kingdom?

220
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,782
Get him to the healing room! Now!

221
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,661
There won't be a kingdom to protect
if you're afraid to act.

222
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:48,249
The Jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.

223
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,960
That's pride and vanity talking,
not leadership.

224
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,088
You've forgotten everything I taught you
about a warrior's patience.

225
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,842
While you wait and be patient,
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

226
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,302
The old ways are done.

227
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,055
You'd stand giving speeches
while Asgard falls.

228
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,641
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

229
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,770
And you are an old man and a fool!

230
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,778
Yes.

231
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,280
I was a fool

232
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,532
to think you were ready.

233
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,159
Father...

234
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,791
Thor Odinson,

235
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,545
you have betrayed
the express command of your king.

236
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,423
Through your arrogance and stupidity,

237
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,385
you've opened these peaceful realms
and innocent lives

238
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,180
to the horror and desolation of war!

239
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:54,148
You are unworthy of these realms!

240
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,068
You're unworthy of your title!

241
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,820
You're unworthy

242
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:05,952
of the loved ones you have betrayed.

243
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,423
I now take from you your power!

244
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,593
In the name of my father

245
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,887
and his father before,

246
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,849
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

247
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,775
Whosoever holds this hammer,
if he be worthy,

248
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,527
shall possess the power of Thor.

249
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,262
I think that was legally your fault.

250
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,014
Get the first aid kit.

251
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,515
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

252
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,607
Does he need CPR?
Because I totally know CPR.

253
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,954
Where did he come from?

254
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,876
You all right?

255
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,337
Hammer?

256
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,581
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
It's pretty obvious.

257
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,592
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

258
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,470
We have to move quickly
before this all changes.

259
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,223
Jane, we have to take him
to the hospital.

260
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,725
- Father!
- He's fine, look at him.

261
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,812
Heimdall! I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!

262
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,814
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

263
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,400
You. What realm is this?

264
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,985
Alfheim? Nornheim?

265
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,111
New Mexico?

266
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:08,533
You dare threaten me, Thor,
with so puny a weapon?

267
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,038
What? He was freaking me out!

268
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,499
Next time
you decide to taser somebody,

269
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,001
make sure he's already in the car, okay?

270
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,296
Jane! Come on.

271
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,357
Name?

272
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,985
He said it was Thor?

273
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:47,321
T-H-O-R.

274
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,408
- And your relationship to him?
- I've never met him before.

275
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,993
Until she hit him with a car.

276
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,787
I grazed him, but she tasered him.

277
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,414
Yes, I did.

278
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,125
Hi.

279
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,582
Just taking a little blood.

280
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,005
How dare you attack the son of Odin?

281
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,965
I need some help!

282
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,593
Call security!

283
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,012
Security to ER 3, stat!

284
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,986
You're no match for the Mighty...

285
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,300
You don't think
this was just a magnetic storm, do you?

286
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,387
Look, the lensing around these edges

287
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,889
is characteristic
of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

288
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,140
A what?

289
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,370
- I thought you were a science major?
- Political science.

290
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,228
She was the only applicant.

291
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,980
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection

292
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,376
between two different points
of space-time.

293
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,733
It's a wormhole.

294
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,820
- Erik, look. What do you see?
- Stars.

295
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,738
Yeah, but not our stars.

296
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:56,575
See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year,

297
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,787
and unless Ursa Minor decided
to take a day off,

298
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,081
these are
someone else's constellations.

299
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,999
Hey! Check this out.

300
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,591
No, it can't be.

301
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,762
I think I left something at the hospital.

302
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,363
It's not possible!

303
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,755
He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.

304
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,056
Oh, my God.

305
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,604
I just lost
my most important piece of evidence.

306
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,730
Typical.

307
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,982
- So now what?
- We find him.

308
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,442
Did you see what he did in there?

309
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,319
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

310
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,798
Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event,

311
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,491
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

312
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,617
Okay.

313
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,328
So we're gonna look
all over New Mexico, right?

314
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,746
Exactly.

315
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,043
What?

316
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,255
I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

317
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,941
I got it, I got it.

318
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,577
Come on, kick it in now!

319
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,462
Did it work?

320
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,403
Sir, we found it.

321
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,997
You know, for a crazy homeless person,
he's pretty cut.

322
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,127
Hey, sorry I tased you!

323
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,548
Excuse me, excuse me!

324
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,307
What is this?

325
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,477
My ex.

326
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:15,024
Good with patients
and bad with relationships.

327
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,587
They're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.

328
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:18,652
They will suffice.

329
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,738
You're welcome.

330
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,281
This mortal form has grown weak.

331
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,199
I need sustenance.

332
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,262
We should never have let him go.

333
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,014
There was no stopping him.

334
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,058
Well, at least he's only banished,
not dead.

335
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,434
Which is what we'd all be

336
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,228
if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

337
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,111
How did the guard even know?

338
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,696
I told him.

339
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,199
What?

340
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,868
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

341
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,430
He should be flogged for taking so long.

342
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,996
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

343
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,122
You told the guard?

344
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,208
I saved our lives.

345
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,126
And Thor's.

346
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,671
I had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.

347
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:20,881
Loki.

348
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,426
You must go to the Allfather
and convince him to change his mind.

349
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,137
And if I do, then what?

350
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,057
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

351
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,268
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.

352
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,312
You saw how he was today.

353
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,205
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

354
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:46,573
He may speak of the good of Asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

355
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,743
We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

356
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,912
Laufey said

357
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,498
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

358
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,420
A master of magic
could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

359
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,923
Loki's always been one for mischief,

360
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,426
but you're talking
about something else entirely.

361
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,281
Stop!

362
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,453
Am I cursed?

363
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,954
No.

364
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,293
What am I?

365
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,795
You're my son.

366
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,974
What more than that?

367
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,398
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,

368
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:02,483
was it?

369
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,574
No.

370
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,744
In the aftermath of the battle,

371
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,663
I went into the temple
and I found a baby.

372
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,004
Small for a giant's offspring.

373
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,341
Abandoned, suffering, left to die.

374
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,514
Laufey's son.

375
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,352
Yes.

376
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,940
Why?

377
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,693
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood,
why would you take me?

378
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,278
You were an innocent child.

379
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:52,366
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

380
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,038
Tell me!

381
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,543
I thought
we could unite our kingdoms one day.

382
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,963
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

383
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,631
Through you.

384
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,882
What?

385
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,302
But those plans no longer matter.

386
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,141
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

387
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,685
locked up here
until you might have use of me.

388
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,228
Why do you twist my words?

389
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,392
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,

390
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,398
why didn't you?

391
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,816
You're my son.

392
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,485
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

393
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,572
Because I'm the monster

394
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,740
parents tell their children about
at night?

395
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,909
- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!

396
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,745
Why you favored Thor all these years!

397
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,707
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

398
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,419
you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

399
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,773
Guards!

400
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,776
Guards, please, help!

401
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,367
How'd you get inside that cloud?

402
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,120
Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts

403
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,747
and still be this hungry?

404
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,922
- This drink, I like it.
- I know. It's great, right?

405
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,131
Another!

406
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,218
Sorry, lzzy. Little accident.

407
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,890
- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.

408
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,184
- Well, you could have just said so.
- I just did.

409
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,687
- No, I mean, ask nicely.
- I meant no disrespect.

410
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,132
All right. Well, no more smashing.

411
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,440
Deal?

412
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:51,902
You have my word.

413
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,196
Good.

414
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,449
The usual, please, lzzy.

415
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,077
You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.

416
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,580
They're saying some kind of satellite
landed out in the desert.

417
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,540
Yeah, we were having
a good time with it

418
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,334
until the Feds showed up.

419
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,254
Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?

420
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,380
Yeah.

421
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,882
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook.
Smile.

422
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,178
What did it look like, the satellite?

423
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,932
I don't know anything about satellites,
but it was heavy.

424
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:26,186
I mean, nobody could lift it.

425
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,939
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

426
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,691
Which way?

427
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,861
Fifty miles west of here.

428
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,905
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

429
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,990
Looked like the whole Army
was coming when we left.

430
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,163
Dumbass!

431
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,332
Where are you going?

432
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,751
- Fifty miles west of here.
- Why?

433
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:53,213
- To get what belongs to me.
- So you own a satellite now?

434
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,358
It's not what they say it is.

435
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,424
Well, whatever it is,

436
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:56,902
the government seems to think
it's theirs.

437
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,969
So, you just intend to go in there
and take it?

438
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,137
Yes.

439
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,806
If you take me there now,

440
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,570
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

441
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,143
- Everything?
- Yes.

442
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,021
All the answers you seek will be yours
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

443
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,148
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

444
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,191
Can I have a word, Jane?

445
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,739
Please don't do this.

446
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,907
You saw what I saw last night.

447
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,470
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.

448
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,514
But I'm not talking about the crater,
I'm talking about him.

449
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,248
- But he's promising us the answers.
- He's delusional.

450
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,413
Listen to what he's saying.

451
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:33,378
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

452
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,922
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

453
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,842
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

454
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,053
He's dangerous, Jane.

455
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,895
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

456
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,438
Then this is where we say goodbye.

457
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,575
Thank you?

458
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:10,874
Jane Foster, Erik Selvig,
Darcy, farewell.

459
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:15,837
All right.

460
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:18,090
Back to work.

461
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,112
That's my stuff!

462
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,118
What the hell is going on here?

463
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,203
Ms. Foster,
I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

464
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,955
Is that supposed to mean something
to me?

465
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,331
- You can't do this!
- Jane!

466
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,543
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.

467
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,670
Let it go? This is my life.

468
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,005
We're investigating a security threat.

469
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,800
We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.

470
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,302
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

471
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,096
Here, this should
more than compensate you

472
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
for your trouble.

473
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,850
I can't just buy replacements
at Radio Shack,

474
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,643
I made most of this equipment myself!

475
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,087
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

476
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:16,273
And I'm sure I can sue you
for violating my constitutional rights!

477
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,859
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster,
but we're the good guys.

478
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,027
So are we!

479
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,322
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

480
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,199
And everything I know
about this phenomenon

481
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,160
is either in this lab or in this book.

482
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,954
And you can't just take this away... Hey!

483
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,833
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...

484
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,087
Thank you for your cooperation.

485
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,858
Years of research, gone.

486
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,777
They even took my iPod.

487
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:05,530
- What about the backups?
- They took our backups.

488
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,284
They took the backups of our backups.
They were extremely thorough.

489
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,703
I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.

490
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,706
Could you please stop with your iPod?

491
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,417
Who are these people?

492
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,879
I knew this scientist.

493
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,924
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

494
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,134
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up

495
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,054
and he wasn't heard from again.

496
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,308
They're not gonna do that to us.
I'm gonna get everything back.

497
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,186
Come on, please.
Let me contact one of my colleagues.

498
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,772
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

499
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,483
I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.

500
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:43,985
They took your laptop, too.

501
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,664
Allfather,
we must speak with you urgently.

502
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,512
My friends.

503
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,514
Where's Odin?

504
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,684
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.

505
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,854
Mother fears
he may never awaken again.

506
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,565
We would speak with her.

507
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,943
She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.

508
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,948
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

509
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,707
Your king.

510
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:54,264
My King, we would ask
that you end Thor's banishment.

511
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,355
My first command
cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.

512
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,611
We're on the brink of war
with Jotunheim.

513
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,656
Our people need a sense of continuity,

514
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,534
in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.

515
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:17,537
All of us must stand together

516
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,040
for the good of Asgard.

517
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,085
Yes, of course.

518
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,380
- Good. Then you will wait for my word.
- If I may

519
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:33,553
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty
to perhaps reconsider...

520
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,888
We're done!

521
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,869
I need a horse!

522
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:45,291
We don't have horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds...

523
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,627
Then give me one of those
large enough to ride.

524
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,796
Hey, you still need a lift?

525
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,721
I've never done anything like this before.

526
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:02,475
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

527
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,060
Many times.

528
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,396
But you're brave to do it.

529
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,023
Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.

530
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,025
I don't really have much left to lose.

531
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,403
Yeah, but you're clever.

532
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,407
Far more clever than anyone else
in this realm.

533
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,034
"Realm"? "Realm"?

534
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,204
- You think me strange.
- Yeah, I do.

535
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,082
Good strange or bad strange?

536
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,251
I'm not quite sure yet.

537
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,924
I'm sorry.

538
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,181
But who are you?

539
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,768
Really?

540
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,730
You'll see soon enough.

541
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,191
You promised me answers.

542
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,738
What you seek, it's a bridge.

543
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,990
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

544
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,241
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

545
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,705
God, I hope you're not crazy.

546
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,885
I never get used to seeing him like this.

547
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,806
He's put it off for so long now,
that I fear...

548
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,060
How long will it last?

549
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:31,731
I don't know. This time it's different.
We were unprepared.

550
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,652
So why did he lie?

551
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:40,740
He kept the truth from you
so that you would never feel different.

552
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:43,159
You are our son, Loki,

553
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,787
and we, your family.

554
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,668
We mustn't lose hope
that your father will return to us.

555
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,337
And your brother.

556
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,590
What hope is there for Thor?

557
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:01,427
There's always a purpose
to everything your father does.

558
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,795
That's no satellite crash!

559
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,190
They would have hauled
the wreckage away,

560
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,894
they wouldn't have built a city around it.

561
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,720
- You're going to need this.
- What? Wait, why?

562
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,391
Now stay here.

563
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,312
Once I have Mjolnir, I will return
the items they've stolen from you.

564
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,646
Deal?

565
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,316
No. Look what's down there.

566
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,277
You think you're just gonna walk in,
grab our stuff and walk out?

567
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,404
No. I'm going to fly out.

568
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,081
Sir, feed from the keyhole
can barely penetrate the cloud cover.

569
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,708
Tech's barely working as it is,

570
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,002
with all the interference
that thing's giving off.

571
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,838
And we've got a commercial aircraft
coming right over us.

572
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:22,008
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.

573
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,332
Reroute it like all the others.

574
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,094
Hold a sec.

575
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,514
We've got something outside the fence,
west side.

576
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,060
Delancey, Jackson.
West side perimeter. Go check it out.

577
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:35,897
There it is.

578
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,324
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

579
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,542
Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.

580
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:13,643
You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.

581
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,647
Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, I'm fine,

582
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,358
but just in case
you don't hear from me in the next hour,

583
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,319
just come by the crater site
and try and find me, okay?

584
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:26,239
I did exactly what you told me not to.
I'm sorry.

585
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,991
So sorry. Bye.

586
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,121
Bravo quadrant, move!

587
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:47,760
Entering south tunnel!

588
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,431
Negative, negative.
I have no comms.

589
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,321
Target sighted, east tunnel!

590
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,282
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

591
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,267
Moving north!

592
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,234
What have we got?

593
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,839
There's a massive
electromagnetic surge

594
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,029
coming off that thing.

595
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,906
Systems are barely coping.

596
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,824
Barton? Talk to me.

597
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,827
You want me to slow him down, sir?

598
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,289
Or are you sending in more guys
for him to beat up?

599
00:56:58,499 --> 00:56:59,999
I'll let you know.

600
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,182
You're big.

601
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,643
Fought bigger.

602
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:06,983
Better call it, Coulson,
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

603
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:28,671
Last chance, sir.

604
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,840
Wait. I want to see this.

605
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,870
All right, show's over.
Ground units, move in.

606
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,550
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

607
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,802
- I can't just leave him there!
- Why?

608
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,054
You didn't see what I saw!

609
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,390
Look! Look, it's Myeu-muh.

610
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,229
Where'd you find this?

611
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,647
The children's section.

612
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,150
I just wanted to show you
how silly his story was.

613
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,152
But you're the one
who's always pushing me

614
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,362
to chase down every possibility,
every alternative!

615
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,698
I'm talking about science, not magic!

616
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,094
Well, magic's just science
that we don't understand yet.

617
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,745
- Arthur C. Clarke.
- Who wrote science fiction.

618
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,331
- A precursor to science fact!
- In some cases, yeah.

619
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,095
Well, if there is
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

620
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,602
then there's something
on the other side.

621
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,336
And advanced beings
could have crossed it!

622
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,503
Jane.

623
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,631
A primitive culture like the Vikings
might have worshipped them as deities.

624
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,425
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

625
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,351
You made my men,

626
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,895
some of the most
highly trained professionals in the world,

627
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,773
look like a bunch of minimum-wage
mall cops.

628
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,817
That's hurtful.

629
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:41,364
In my experience, it takes someone
who's received similar training

630
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,903
to do what you did to them.

631
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,036
Why don't you tell me
where you received your training?

632
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:50,998
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?

633
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,503
No, you strike me
more as the soldier of fortune type.

634
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,173
Where was it? South Africa?

635
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:04,595
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

636
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,349
Who are you?

637
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,731
One way or another,
we find out what we need to know.

638
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,400
We're good at that.

639
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,490
Don't go anywhere.

640
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:33,457
Loki! What are you doing here?

641
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,292
I had to see you.

642
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,295
What's happened?

643
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,631
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

644
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,383
Let me explain to Father.

645
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,801
Father is dead.

646
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,308
What?

647
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:54,812
Your banishment,

648
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,982
the threat of a new war,

649
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,818
it was too much for him to bear.

650
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,656
You mustn't blame yourself.

651
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,992
I know that you loved him.

652
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,662
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

653
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,167
It was so cruel
to put the hammer within your reach,

654
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,210
knowing that you could never lift it.

655
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,799
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

656
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,057
Can I come home?

657
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,978
The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.

658
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:42,443
- Yes, but couldn't we find a way...
- And Mother has forbidden your return.

659
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,406
This is goodbye, Brother.

660
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,744
I'm so sorry.

661
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,501
No.

662
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,670
I am sorry.

663
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,345
Thank you for coming here.

664
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,184
Farewell.

665
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,532
Goodbye.

666
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,534
Goodbye?

667
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,452
I just got back.

668
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,406
Sir?

669
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,658
He's got a visitor.

670
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,832
His name is Donald Blake?

671
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,750
Dr. Donald Blake.

672
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,711
You have dangerous coworkers,
Dr. Selvig.

673
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:27,840
He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all our research.

674
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,926
That was years of his life, gone!

675
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,180
You can understand
how a man could go off like that.

676
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,725
A big, faceless organization like yours

677
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,727
coming in with their
jackbooted thugs and...

678
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,355
That's how he put it.

679
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,565
That still doesn't explain

680
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,369
how he managed
to tear through our security.

681
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,945
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.

682
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,781
Sir?

683
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,787
It says here that he's an M.D.

684
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,332
Well, he is! Or he was.

685
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,959
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

686
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,961
A brilliant physicist.

687
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:08,255
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

688
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,552
Donny, Donny, Donny!

689
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:18,057
There you are. You're gonna be all right.
I'm taking you home now.

690
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,989
Dr. Selvig!

691
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,493
Just keep him away from the bars.

692
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,328
I will!

693
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,999
- Where are we going?
- To get a drink.

694
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,668
Follow them.

695
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,259
You know, I had it all backwards.

696
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,846
I had it all wrong.

697
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,937
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

698
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,189
You start asking the right questions.

699
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:15,364
For the first time in my life,

700
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:20,077
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

701
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,081
Anyone who's ever going to
find his way in this world

702
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:27,292
has to start by admitting
he doesn't know where the hell he is.

703
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,796
Thank you for what you've done.

704
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,298
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.

705
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,553
Her father and I
taught at university together.

706
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,471
He was a good man.

707
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,557
He never listened.

708
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,476
Neither did I.

709
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,813
My father
was trying to teach me something,

710
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,815
but I was too stupid to see it.

711
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,945
I don't know if you're delusional
or if you're pulling some kind of con,

712
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,363
I don't care.

713
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:57,781
I just care about her.

714
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,577
I've seen the way she looks at you.

715
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,499
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

716
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:08,751
Good.

717
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:13,422
In that case, I'll buy you another round,
and you leave town tonight.

718
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:20,429
Two boilermakers.

719
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:13,607
Kill him.

720
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,194
After all I've done for you?

721
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:24,201
So you're the one
who showed us the way into Asgard.

722
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:26,703
That was just a bit of fun, really.

723
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,874
To ruin my brother's big day.

724
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:35,546
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

725
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,174
I will hear you.

726
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:47,057
I will conceal you
and a handful of your soldiers,

727
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:52,729
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

728
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,857
Why not kill him yourself?

729
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,611
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly

730
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,947
to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

731
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:06,201
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you

732
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:11,290
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

733
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,502
Glory.

734
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,130
I...

735
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,466
Accept.

736
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:28,891
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

737
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:34,146
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

738
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:36,064
You were shrouded from me,

739
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,317
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

740
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,987
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

741
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,739
Or perhaps someone has found a way

742
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:46,909
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

743
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,245
You have great power, Heimdall.

744
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,249
Did Odin ever fear you?

745
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,170
- No.
- And why is that?

746
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,506
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

747
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:06,011
He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.

748
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:07,930
Yes?

749
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,770
Yes.

750
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,190
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

751
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,109
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

752
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,876
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

753
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,212
He's fine. Not injured at all.

754
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,631
I'm sorry, my friend.

755
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,549
- What happened?
- We drank, we fought,

756
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,134
he made his ancestors proud.

757
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,428
Put him on the bed.

758
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:03,235
I still don't think
you're the God of Thunder.

759
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,071
But you ought to be.

760
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,667
Are these your chambers?

761
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,754
It's more of a temporary living situation.

762
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:27,426
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

763
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,929
Actually, I never have guests.

764
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,267
That's not the right place for it.

765
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,936
I'm sorry.

766
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,065
Can we go outside?

767
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,359
Yes, of course.

768
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,159
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

769
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:56,371
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

770
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,959
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

771
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,882
I'm really glad you're safe.

772
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,469
You've been very kind to me,

773
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,388
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

774
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,265
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

775
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,392
so I think that kind of evens things out.

776
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,646
Perhaps I had it coming.

777
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:28,820
Oh, my God!

778
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:31,406
I don't believe it!

779
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:35,077
It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

780
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:39,831
No, no, this is great! This is...
I don't have to start from scratch now.

781
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,500
Thank you.

782
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,589
What's wrong?

783
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,008
S.H.I.E.L.D.

784
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,426
Whatever they are,

785
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,569
they're gonna do
everything in their power

786
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:57,349
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

787
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:58,850
No, Jane.

788
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,353
Listen to me. You must not give up.

789
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,605
- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

790
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,440
Because you're right.

791
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,275
Here, look.

792
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,365
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

793
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,701
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

794
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,884
What is that?

795
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,013
My father explained it to me like this,

796
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,849
that your world

797
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,768
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,

798
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:44,855
linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,

799
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,149
the Worlds Tree.

800
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,068
Now you see it every day
without realizing.

801
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,405
The images glimpsed through...
What did you call it?

802
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,657
This Hooble Telescope.

803
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:59,077
- Hubble.
- Hubble Telescope.

804
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,498
Tell me more.

805
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,584
So, the Nine Realms.

806
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,753
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

807
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,589
This is Alfheim.

808
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,592
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.

809
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,760
And Asgard.

810
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,180
And that's where I come from.

811
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:36,948
Thank you, Jane.

812
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,330
Our dearest friend banished,
Loki on the throne,

813
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:46,791
Asgard on the brink of war,
yet you've managed to consume

814
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:50,045
four wild boar,
six pheasant, a side of beef,

815
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:53,590
and two casks of ale. Shame on you.
Don't you care?

816
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,468
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

817
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,553
Stop it, both of you!

818
01:15:58,888 --> 01:15:59,888
Stop.

819
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,642
- We all know what we have to do.
- We must go.

820
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:08,563
We must find Thor.

821
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:10,732
It's treason.

822
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,734
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

823
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,986
Thor would do the same for us.

824
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,405
Now shush.

825
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,243
Heimdall might be watching.

826
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:28,917
Heimdall demands your presence.

827
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,756
We're doomed.

828
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,510
You would defy the commands of Loki,
our king,

829
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,596
break every oath you
have taken as warriors,

830
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:44,015
and commit treason to bring Thor back?

831
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,684
- Yes.
- Good.

832
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,352
So you'll help us?

833
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,315
I am bound by honor to our king.
I cannot open the bridge to you.

834
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,693
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

835
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,611
Now what do we do?

836
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,281
Look!

837
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,070
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, sir.

838
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,446
We got massive energy readings
out of nowhere

839
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,972
and then they just disappeared.
Fifteen miles due northwest.

840
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,390
Let's go take a look.

841
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:51,624
Thank you.

842
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,710
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

843
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,678
Base to Team 2,
we've got activity outside the town.

844
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:04,888
Stay on your target.

845
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:16,733
Ensure my brother does not return.

846
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,238
Destroy everything.

847
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:34,417
Mom?

848
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,302
Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?

849
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:45,720
Call it in.

850
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:47,389
Yeah.

851
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:52,894
Base, we've got Xena, Jackie Chan
and Robin Hood.

852
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,730
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

853
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:59,734
But you won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.

854
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,152
Not without hard evidence.

855
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,071
Found you!

856
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,079
My friends!

857
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,582
This is good! This is good.

858
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,167
I don't believe it.

859
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,295
Excuse me.
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

860
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:23,591
My friends,

861
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:26,177
I've never been happier to see anyone.

862
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,054
But you should not have come.

863
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:31,349
We're here to take you home.

864
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,519
You know I can't go home.

865
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,440
My father

866
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,608
is dead because of me.

867
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:43,820
And I must remain in exile.

868
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,113
Thor,

869
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,157
your father still lives.

870
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,508
Tell me, Loki,
how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?

871
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:09,220
You think the Bifrost is the only way
in and out of this realm?

872
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,905
There are secret paths
between the worlds

873
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,641
to which even you, with all your gifts,
are blind.

874
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,895
But I have need of them no longer,
now that I am king.

875
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,646
And I say, for your act of treason,

876
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,649
you are relieved of your duties
as Gatekeeper,

877
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,526
and no longer citizen of Asgard.

878
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:26,613
Then I need no longer obey you.

879
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:50,011
Get somebody from Linguistics
down here.

880
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,998
Was somebody else coming?

881
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:24,295
Is that one of Stark's?

882
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,966
I don't know.
The guy never tells me anything.

883
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:32,929
Hello.

884
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,723
You are using
unregistered weapons technology.

885
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:36,975
Identify yourself.

886
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:41,729
Here we go.

887
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,484
Incoming!

888
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,535
Jane, you have to leave.

889
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,662
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm staying here.

890
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,581
Thor's going to fight with us!

891
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,249
My friends,

892
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:05,670
I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way,
or worse, get one of you killed.

893
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,839
But I can help
get these people to safety.

894
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,174
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

895
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,760
- We'll need some time.
- You'll have it!

896
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,887
Okay, move it, people!

897
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,932
Everybody out! Use the back door.

898
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:19,934
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

899
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,532
Keep it distracted.

900
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,633
For Asgard!

901
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,002
Fall back!

902
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:45,728
Go. Now. Run!

903
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,509
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

904
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:19,095
No. I will die a warrior's death.

905
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,305
Stories will be told of this day.

906
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:24,308
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

907
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,438
Now go.

908
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,865
You must return to Asgard.
You have to stop Loki.

909
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,533
What about you?

910
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:43,119
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.

911
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:45,037
Come on.

912
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,419
We need to fall back. Come on.

913
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,503
Come on.

914
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:01,554
Wait!

915
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,646
What's he doing?

916
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:41,177
Brother,
whatever I have done to wrong you,

917
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:44,514
whatever I have done
to lead you to do this,

918
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,682
I am truly sorry.

919
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,894
But these people are innocent.

920
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:54,357
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.

921
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:03,366
So take mine

922
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:05,409
and end this.

923
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:20,466
No.

924
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:37,900
It's over.

925
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,570
No. It's not over.

926
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:43,114
I mean, you're safe.

927
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:45,199
We're safe.

928
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:46,909
It's over.

929
01:26:52,916 --> 01:27:00,916
No.

930
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,672
- We're spiking.
- Levels increase!

931
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:43,633
Whosoever holds this hammer,

932
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,178
if he be worthy,

933
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:52,350
shall possess the power of Thor.

934
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,241
Jane!

935
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,789
- No. No. No!
- Come!

936
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:39,230
Oh. My. God.

937
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:50,051
So, is this how you normally look?

938
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:51,927
More or less.

939
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,513
It's a good look.

940
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:58,100
We must go to the Bifrost site.
I would have words with my brother.

941
01:29:58,185 --> 01:29:59,268
Excuse me!

942
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:04,523
Donald?

943
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,128
I don't think
you've been completely honest with me.

944
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,360
Know this, Son of Coul.

945
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:11,614
You and I, we fight for the same cause,
the protection of this world.

946
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:13,741
From this day forward,
you can count me as your ally

947
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:16,827
if you return the items
you have taken from Jane.

948
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,579
- Stolen.
- Borrowed.

949
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,582
Of course,
you can have your equipment back.

950
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,834
You're gonna need it
to continue your research.

951
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,921
Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?

952
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,215
Sure.

953
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:32,885
Wait, I need to debrief you!

954
01:30:40,102 --> 01:30:41,310
Welcome to Asgard.

955
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,130
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

956
01:31:16,847 --> 01:31:18,139
Heimdall?

957
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:23,686
Heimdall!

958
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,231
He doesn't answer.

959
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:29,483
Then we are stranded.

960
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:32,486
Heimdall!
If you can hear me, we need you now!

961
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:36,157
Heimdall! We need you now!

962
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:43,873
Heimdall!

963
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:01,557
I must go back to Asgard,
but I give you my word,

964
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,102
I will return for you.

965
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:13,903
Deal?

966
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,792
Deal.

967
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,311
Get him to the healing room!

968
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,314
Leave my brother to me.

969
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:16,674
It's said

970
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:21,679
you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.

971
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:25,182
I hope it's true,

972
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:29,186
so that you may know

973
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:34,149
your death came at the hand

974
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,360
of Laufey.

975
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,997
And your death came
by the son of Odin.

976
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:55,254
Loki!

977
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:56,839
You saved him!

978
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:03,595
I swear to you, Mother,

979
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,140
that they will pay for what
they've done today.

980
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:07,558
Loki.

981
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:09,393
Thor!

982
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,313
I knew you'd return to us.

983
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,361
Why don't you tell her

984
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:23,073
how you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?

985
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,158
What?

986
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,660
Why, it must have been enforcing
Father's last command.

987
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:29,621
You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been.

988
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:31,498
It's good to have you back.

989
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,502
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

990
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:18,420
You can't stop it.

991
01:35:18,505 --> 01:35:21,840
The Bifrost will build until
it rips Jotunheim apart.

992
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:44,863
Jane?

993
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:48,325
Why have you done this?

994
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:52,329
To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

995
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:55,249
When he wakes,
I will have saved his life.

996
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:58,043
I will have destroyed that
race of monsters.

997
01:35:58,128 --> 01:36:00,254
And I will be true heir to the throne!

998
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:02,631
You can't kill an entire race!

999
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:04,049
Why not?

1000
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:10,097
And what is this newfound love
for the Frost Giants?

1001
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:14,518
You could have killed them all
with your bare hands.

1002
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,687
- I've changed.
- So have I.

1003
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,940
Now fight me.

1004
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:24,778
I never wanted the throne!

1005
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,948
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1006
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,784
I will not fight you, Brother!

1007
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:32,286
I'm not your brother.

1008
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,329
I never was.

1009
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:35,914
Loki, this is madness.

1010
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:38,125
Is it madness?

1011
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,796
Is it?

1012
01:36:43,882 --> 01:36:47,885
Come on. What happened to you
on Earth that turned you so soft?

1013
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:51,388
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1014
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:54,600
It was!

1015
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:58,812
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,
I'll pay her a visit myself!

1016
01:37:41,147 --> 01:37:43,065
Thor!

1017
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:51,323
Brother, please.

1018
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:04,002
Enough!

1019
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:48,964
Look at you,

1020
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:52,968
the Mighty Thor,

1021
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:58,223
with all your strength,

1022
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,560
and what good does it do you now?

1023
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:06,690
Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!

1024
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,959
What are you doing?

1025
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:31,048
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

1026
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:42,351
Forgive me, Jane.

1027
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,849
I could have done it, Father!

1028
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,686
I could have done it!

1029
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:27,437
For you!

1030
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:29,648
For all of us!

1031
01:40:31,818 --> 01:40:33,151
No, Loki.

1032
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:42,911
Loki, no.

1033
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,331
No!

1034
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:51,753
No.

1035
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:09,438
It's gone.

1036
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:24,805
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1037
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:29,142
I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!

1038
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:32,896
Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?

1039
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:38,985
As a matter of fact, falling was a tactic
lulling the Destroyer...

1040
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,002
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1041
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:03,176
How is he?

1042
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,514
He mourns for his brother.

1043
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,016
And...

1044
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:12,769
He misses her.

1045
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:15,105
The mortal.

1046
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:33,290
You'll be a wise king.

1047
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:40,130
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

1048
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,216
Or a better father.

1049
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:57,272
I have much to learn.

1050
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:00,775
I know that now.

1051
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:07,741
Someday, perhaps,

1052
01:44:09,035 --> 01:44:10,952
I shall make you proud.

1053
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:20,795
You've already made me proud.

1054
01:44:35,353 --> 01:44:37,354
So Earth is lost to us.

1055
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:39,689
No.

1056
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,692
There is always hope.

1057
01:44:46,697 --> 01:44:48,198
Can you see her?

1058
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:52,452
Yes.

1059
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:58,041
I have the particle detectors!

1060
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,210
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

1061
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:02,379
Yeah. Have you seen my taser?

1062
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:03,880
How is she?

1063
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:06,049
In the car. Come on, Jane!

1064
01:45:06,384 --> 01:45:08,468
She searches for you.

1065
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,959
Dr. Selvig.

1066
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:24,964
So you're the man behind all this?

1067
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:29,135
It's quite a labyrinth.

1068
01:53:29,887 --> 01:53:33,806
I was thinking
they're taking me down here to kill me.

1069
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:43,983
I've been hearing
about the New Mexico situation.

1070
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:48,488
Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.

1071
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:50,573
I have a lot to work with.

1072
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:54,452
The Foster Theory.
A gateway to another dimension.

1073
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:56,120
It's unprecedented.

1074
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:00,082
Isn't it?

1075
01:54:03,504 --> 01:54:06,839
Legend tells us one thing,
history, another.

1076
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:11,385
But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.

1077
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:20,186
What is it?

1078
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,395
Power, Doctor.

1079
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:23,940
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1080
01:54:24,358 --> 01:54:25,858
maybe unlimited power.

1081
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:33,655
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
