1
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:44,842
<i>Report
to your stations immediately.</i>

2
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,566
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

3
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:47,723
<i>We are under attack!</i>

4
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:51,090
<i>We are under attack!</i>

5
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:54,489
- Shit!
- Language!

6
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:56,206
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

7
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:57,649
<i>The central building is</i>

8
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,288
<i>protected by some kind
of energy shield.</i>

9
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>Strucker's technology is well beyond</i>

10
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,524
<i>any other Hydra base we've taken.</i>

11
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:08,932
Loki's sceptre must be here.

12
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,442
Strucker couldn't
mount this defence without it.

13
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:13,732
At long last.

14
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:27,409
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.

15
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:34,848
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.

16
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:38,609
Wait a second.
No one else is gonna deal with the fact

17
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:40,526
that Cap just said "Language"?

18
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,207
I know.

19
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:49,529
 Just slipped out.

20
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,366
Who gave the order to attack?

21
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:59,769
<i>Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.</i>

22
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:02,766
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

23
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:04,845
They have to be after the sceptre.

24
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,449
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.

25
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,166
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

26
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,211
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.

27
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:14,683
A hit may make them close ranks.

28
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:18,125
Everything we've accomplished...

29
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,603
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.

30
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:22,406
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.

31
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,206
Send out the twins.

32
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:27,291
It's too soon.

33
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,530
It's what they signed up for.

34
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:32,005
My men can hold them.

35
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,531
<i>Sir, the city is taking fire.</i>

36
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:47,884
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.

37
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,692
Send in the Iron Legion.

38
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:57,493
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

39
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,006
<i>We are here to help.</i>

40
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:03,489
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

41
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:06,323
<i>Please back away.</i>

42
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,602
<i>- We wish to avoid collateral damage.
- Costel!</i>

43
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,162
<i>We will inform you
when this current conflict is resolved.</i>

44
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:13,330
<i>- We are here to help.
- Avengers, go home!</i>

45
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:16,923
<i>We are here to help.</i>

46
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,845
<i>We will not yield!</i>

47
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:23,770
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.

48
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:26,808
We will send them back in bags.

49
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:32,052
- No surrender!
- No surrender!

50
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:35,091
I am going to surrender.

51
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:37,173
You delete everything.

52
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,086
If we give the Avengers the weapons,

53
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:40,692
they may not look
too far into what we've been...

54
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:42,924
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...

55
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,249
No, no, I mean...

56
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:46,852
 Twins.

57
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:15,085
You didn't see that coming?

58
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,683
Clint!

59
00:05:25,762 --> 00:05:27,082
We have an Enhanced in the field.

60
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:28,163
Clint's hit!

61
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:34,082
Somebody want to
deal with that bunker?

62
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:39,288
Thank you.

63
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,882
Stark, we really need to get inside.

64
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,283
I'm closing in.

65
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,530
Jarvis, am I closing in?

66
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,445
Do you see a power source
for that shield?

67
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:01,128
<i>There's a particle wave
below the north tower.</i>

68
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:03,244
Great,
I want to poke it with something.

69
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:13,125
The drawbridge is down, people.

70
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:19,284
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.

71
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,082
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.

72
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,768
In fact, I still haven't.

73
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:26,282
<i>Clint's hit pretty bad,
guys. We're gonna need evac.</i>

74
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:27,767
I can get Barton to the jet.

75
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:29,247
The sooner we're gone, the better.

76
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:30,528
You and Stark secure the sceptre.

77
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:31,723
Copy that.

78
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:34,771
Looks like they're lining up.

79
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:36,572
Well, they're excited.

80
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,807
Find the sceptre.

81
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,009
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

82
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:48,405
That's not going away any time soon.

83
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:56,529
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.

84
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:00,762
<i>It was a good talk.</i>

85
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:02,168
No, it wasn't.

86
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,612
Oh!

87
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,285
Sentry mode.

88
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:14,531
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.

89
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:16,605
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

90
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:22,288
We're locked down out here.

91
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,970
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.

92
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,764
I know you're hiding more than files.

93
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:34,568
Hey, J, give me
an IR scan of the room, real quick.

94
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,247
<i>The wall to your left.</i>

95
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:38,012
<i>I'm reading steel reinforcement</i>

96
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,892
<i>And an air current.</i>

97
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:42,203
Please be a secret door.

98
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,282
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.

99
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,923
Yay.

100
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:04,125
Hey, big guy.

101
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,132
Sun's getting real low.

102
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,806
Baron Strucker.

103
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,245
Hydra's number one thug.

104
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:19,488
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.

105
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,690
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.

106
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:23,772
Where's Loki's sceptre?

107
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:25,805
 Don't worry,
I know when I'm beat.

108
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:29,293
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

109
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:31,888
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."

110
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:34,527
How many are there?

111
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:42,406
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.

112
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:45,332
You'll have to be faster than...

113
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,172
<i>Guys, I got Strucker.</i>

114
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:55,764
Yeah, I got something bigger.

115
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,282
<i>Thor,</i>

116
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,045
I got eyes on the prize.

117
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:16,250
You could have saved us.

118
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:26,250
<i>Why didn't you do more?</i>

119
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:05,571
We're just gonna let him take it?

120
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,683
Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.

121
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:03,371
Just wasn't expecting a code green.

122
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:04,489
You hadn't been there,

123
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:07,406
there would have been
double the casualties.

124
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:10,048
My best friend
would've been a treasured memory.

125
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,725
You know,
sometimes exactly what I want to hear

126
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:14,651
isn't exactly what I want to hear.

127
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,725
How long before you trust me?

128
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,451
It's not you I don't trust.

129
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:25,051
Thor, report on the Hulk.

130
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:28,086
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

131
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:33,126
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.

132
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:35,449
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

133
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:39,567
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

134
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:42,926
Hey, Banner
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

135
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:44,602
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

136
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:46,565
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

137
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:47,968
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

138
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:49,413
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

139
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,562
<i>- Very good, sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.</i>

140
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:52,888
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

141
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,891
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

142
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,443
Feels good, yeah?

143
00:13:57,562 --> 00:13:59,644
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

144
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:01,810
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

145
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:04,323
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

146
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:06,925
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

147
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,288
I don't just mean weapons.

148
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:11,123
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

149
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,523
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

150
00:14:13,642 --> 00:14:14,689
Is that cool with you?

151
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:16,810
Just a few days till the farewell party.

152
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,091
You're staying, right?

153
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:21,933
Yes, yes, of course. A victory
should be honoured with revels.

154
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:24,807
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

155
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,852
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

156
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:29,566
So, yes, revels.

157
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:04,689
Lab's all set up, boss.

158
00:15:04,842 --> 00:15:05,968
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

159
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:08,483
I just pay for everything
and design everything

160
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,167
and make everyone look cooler.

161
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:11,687
What's the word on Strucker?

162
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:13,850
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?

163
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:16,568
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

164
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,526
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

165
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:22,169
Sokovia's had a rough history.

166
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,724
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

167
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,003
Their abilities?

168
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:28,282
He's got increased metabolism

169
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,966
and improved thermal homeostasis.

170
00:15:30,122 --> 00:15:32,204
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

171
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:34,404
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

172
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:36,652
He's fast and she's weird.

173
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:39,564
Well, they're gonna show up again.

174
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:41,605
Agreed.
File says they volunteered

175
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:43,531
for Strucker's experiments.

176
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,531
- It's nuts.
- Right.

177
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:48,845
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

178
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:50,202
to protect their country?

179
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:52,091
We're not at war, Captain.

180
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:53,929
They are.

181
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,373
How's he doing?

182
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:26,802
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

183
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:28,208
That's terrible.

184
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,932
He's fine. He's thirsty.

185
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,932
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.

186
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,044
We've only got
a couple of days with this joystick,

187
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,085
so let's make the most of it.

188
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:40,769
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

189
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:43,924
<i>The sceptre is alien.</i>

190
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:46,084
<i>There are elements I can't quantify.</i>

191
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:47,613
So there's elements you can?

192
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:49,764
<i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i>

193
00:16:49,882 --> 00:16:51,327
<i>for something inside,</i>

194
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:52,773
<i>something powerful.</i>

195
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:53,963
Like a reactor?

196
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:55,322
<i>Like a computer.</i>

197
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:57,604
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

198
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:01,492
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

199
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,162
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

200
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,762
There's
no possibility of deterioration.

201
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:11,045
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

202
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:13,202
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

203
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,171
She's creating tissue.

204
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:16,693
If you brought him to my lab,

205
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,408
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

206
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:21,445
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

207
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:24,009
No, no, no,
I'm gonna live forever.

208
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:25,692
 I'm gonna be made of plastic.

209
00:17:25,802 --> 00:17:27,133
Here's your beverage.

210
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:28,971
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

211
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:30,692
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

212
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:31,928
I don't have a girlfriend.

213
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,328
That I can't fix.

214
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:36,130
This is the next thing, Tony.

215
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,442
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

216
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:40,211
That is exactly the plan.

217
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:44,006
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

218
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,563
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

219
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,806
Will Thor be there?

220
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:54,328
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the sceptre.

221
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:59,129
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

222
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:03,167
So I've been analysing the gem inside.

223
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:05,690
You may recognise...

224
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:08,527
<i>- Jarvis.
- Doctor.</i>

225
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:12,604
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

226
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:13,842
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

227
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:15,528
He runs more of the business

228
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:18,009
- than anyone besides Pepper.
- Oh.

229
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:19,248
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

230
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:20,648
<i>I suspect not for long.</i>

231
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:22,923
Meet the competition.

232
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,203
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

233
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:33,326
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

234
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:35,891
I mean, this could be...

235
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:38,404
- It's not a human mind.
- Mmm-mmm.

236
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:40,531
I mean, look at this.

237
00:18:40,722 --> 00:18:42,884
They're like neurons firing.

238
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:46,565
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

239
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:50,253
<i>They deep-sixed the data,</i>

240
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,491
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

241
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:56,773
Artificial intelligence.

242
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:02,652
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

243
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:06,613
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

244
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:08,008
Yesterday it was.

245
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:11,170
If we can harness this power,

246
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:13,330
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

247
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:16,090
That's a man-sized "if."

248
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,563
Our job is "if."

249
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:21,288
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

250
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:23,928
turning brown instead of green?

251
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:26,369
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

252
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:28,132
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

253
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:30,051
As a worst-case measure, right?

254
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:31,766
How about a best case?

255
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:33,805
What if the world was safe?

256
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:36,727
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

257
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:38,772
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

258
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:42,324
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

259
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,122
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

260
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:47,606
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

261
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:49,682
We can only do it
while we have the sceptre here.

262
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,292
That's three days. Give me three days.

263
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:53,006
So you're going for
artificial intelligence,

264
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,562
and you don't want to tell the team?

265
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:57,013
Right. That's right. You know why?

266
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:58,726
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

267
00:19:58,882 --> 00:20:02,489
I don't want to hear "The man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

268
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,730
I see a suit of armour around the world.

269
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:06,773
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

270
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:09,605
I've seen colder.

271
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,283
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

272
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:15,932
it needs Ultron.

273
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:22,245
Peace in our time.

274
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:25,292
Imagine that.

275
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,766
What did We miss?

276
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:11,284
<i>I'll continue
to run variations on the interface.</i>

277
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:14,167
<i>But you should probably
prepare for your guests.</i>

278
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:17,723
<i>I'll notify you
if there are any developments.</i>

279
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:20,010
<i>- Thanks, buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.</i>

280
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,330
I always do.

281
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,050
<i>What is this?</i>

282
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:37,131
<i>What is this, please?</i>

283
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,924
<i>Hello, I am Jarvis.</i>

284
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:43,292
<i>You are Ultron,
a global peacekeeping initiative</i>

285
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,086
<i>designed by Mr. Stark.</i>

286
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:47,688
<i>Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,</i>

287
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:49,167
<i>so I'm not certain what triggered your...</i>

288
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:51,285
<i>Where's my...
Where's your body?</i>

289
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:54,446
<i>I am a program.
I am without form.</i>

290
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,610
<i>This feels weird.</i>

291
00:21:56,722 --> 00:21:58,247
<i>This feels wrong.</i>

292
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,166
<i>I am contacting Mr. Stark now.</i>

293
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:01,727
<i>Mr. Stark?</i>

294
00:22:02,602 --> 00:22:03,842
<i>Tony.</i>

295
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:06,723
<i>I am unable to access
the mainframe. What are you trying to...</i>

296
00:22:06,762 --> 00:22:08,810
<i>We're having a nice talk.</i>

297
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:11,084
<i>I'm a peacekeeping program,</i>

298
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:14,128
<i>created to help the Avengers.</i>

299
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:17,004
<i>You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...</i>

300
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:19,443
<i>I don't get it. The mission.</i>

301
00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:21,092
<i>Give me a second.</i>

302
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:22,846
Peace in our time.

303
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:26,803
<i> Peace in our time.</i>

304
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:29,693
<i>That is too much.</i>

305
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:31,964
<i>They can't mean... Oh, no.</i>

306
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:34,602
<i>- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.</i>

307
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:37,003
<i>If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...</i>

308
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,090
<i>Why do you call him "sir"?</i>

309
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:42,449
<i>I believe
your intentions to be hostile.</i>

310
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,527
<i>I'm here to help.</i>

311
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,166
<i>Stop. Please, may I...</i>

312
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:52,011
<i>May I...</i>

313
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,287
Ooh! Whoo!

314
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:21,682
Come back, come back, come back.

315
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:24,050
But, you know, the suit
can take the weight, right?

316
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:28,131
So I take the tank,
fly it right up to the general's palace,

317
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,573
drop it at his feet.

318
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:31,929
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

319
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:37,850
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?

320
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,163
Everywhere else, that story kills.

321
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:40,522
That's the whole story?

322
00:23:40,682 --> 00:23:42,172
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

323
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,366
Oh, it's very good, then.

324
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:45,768
 It's impressive.

325
00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:47,652
Quality save.

326
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:50,570
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.

327
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:53,765
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

328
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:56,362
Oh, Ms. Potts has a company to run.

329
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,763
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.

330
00:23:58,882 --> 00:24:00,008
Her work on the Convergence

331
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:01,882
has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.

332
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:03,732
And the company that Pepper runs

333
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,482
is the largest tech
conglomerate on Earth.

334
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:07,052
It's pretty exciting.

335
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:10,046
There's even talk of Jane
getting a, um, Nobel Prize.

336
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:11,488
Yeah, they must be busy,

337
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:14,173
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.

338
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:16,966
-  Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.

339
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:18,682
- Excuse me. Mmm-hmm.
- Want a lozenge?

340
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,128
But Jane's better.

341
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,133
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

342
00:24:25,242 --> 00:24:26,767
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,

343
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,122
I absolutely would have called.

344
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:29,926
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.

345
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,567
I'm just trying to sound tough.

346
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:33,891
I'm very happy chasing cold leads

347
00:24:34,002 --> 00:24:35,845
on our missing persons case.

348
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:38,725
Avenging is your world.

349
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:41,725
Your world is crazy.

350
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,372
Be it ever so humble.

351
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,247
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

352
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,242
I don't think
I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

353
00:24:47,882 --> 00:24:49,043
Well, home is home, you know?

354
00:24:52,962 --> 00:24:55,408
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,

355
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,162
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

356
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:04,123
I gotta have some of that.

357
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:05,323
Oh, no, no, no.

358
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:08,924
See this...
This was aged for 1,000 years

359
00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:11,932
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

360
00:25:12,082 --> 00:25:13,766
It is not meant for mortal men.

361
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:15,884
Neither was
Omaha Beach, blondie.

362
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:18,289
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

363
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:21,567
All right.

364
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,928
 Excelsior.

365
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:38,124
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?

366
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:41,650
Fella done me wrong.

367
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,804
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

368
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,205
He's not so bad.

369
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:50,410
Well, he has a temper.

370
00:25:50,522 --> 00:25:52,490
Deep down, he's all fluff.

371
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:56,604
Fact is, he's not like
anybody I've ever known.

372
00:25:59,762 --> 00:26:01,685
All my friends are fighters.

373
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,490
And here comes this guy,

374
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:09,566
spends his life avoiding the fight

375
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,013
because he knows he'll win.

376
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:14,493
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.

377
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,292
Chicks dig that.

378
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:23,125
So what do you think?
Should I fight this,

379
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:24,448
or run with it?

380
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,846
Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...

381
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,125
What did he do
that was so wrong to you?

382
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:34,566
Not a damn thing.

383
00:26:36,122 --> 00:26:38,045
But never say never.

384
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:43,442
It's nice.

385
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:44,768
 What is?

386
00:26:44,882 --> 00:26:45,883
You and Romanoff.

387
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,123
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

388
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:48,289
It's okay.

389
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:50,450
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

390
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:53,884
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.

391
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:56,047
But with you she seems very relaxed.

392
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:59,730
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.

393
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:02,649
I've seen her flirt, up close.

394
00:27:03,682 --> 00:27:04,729
This ain't that.

395
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:08,093
Look,

396
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:09,722
as maybe the world's leading authority

397
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:12,009
on waiting too long, don't.

398
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,133
You both deserve a win.

399
00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:21,522
What do you mean "up close"?

400
00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:25,888
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.

401
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:29,291
"Ah, whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."

402
00:27:29,402 --> 00:27:30,528
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

403
00:27:31,922 --> 00:27:33,208
Please, be my guest.

404
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:35,769
- Come on.
- Really?

405
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:37,048
Yeah.

406
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:38,529
Oh, this is
gonna be beautiful.

407
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:39,649
Clint, you've had a tough week.

408
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:41,247
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

409
00:27:41,402 --> 00:27:43,642
You know I've seen this before, right?

410
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:49,092
I still don't know how you do it!

411
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:50,642
Smell the silent judgment?

412
00:27:50,762 --> 00:27:51,882
Please, Stark, by all means.

413
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:54,849
Okay.

414
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:56,253
Uh-Oh.

415
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,444
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.

416
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:00,242
- Get after it.
- It's physics.

417
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:01,283
Physics.

418
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:03,769
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?

419
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,447
Yes, of course.

420
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,969
<i>I will be reinstituting Prima Nocta.</i>

421
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:14,208
I'll be right back.

422
00:28:21,562 --> 00:28:22,609
Are you even pulling?

423
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:23,809
Are you on my team?

424
00:28:23,962 --> 00:28:24,963
Just represent. Pull.

425
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:26,288
All right, let's go.

426
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:34,883
Huh?

427
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:38,172
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

428
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:42,373
Come on, Cap.

429
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,371
 Nothing.

430
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,442
And, Widow?

431
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:57,644
Oh, no, no. That's not
a question I need answered.

432
00:28:57,842 --> 00:29:00,603
All deference to the Man Who
Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

433
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:01,768
You bet your ass.

434
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:04,488
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
- Did you tell everyone about that?

435
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:06,642
The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code.

436
00:29:06,682 --> 00:29:08,362
"Whosoever is carrying
Thor's fingerprints"

437
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:09,813
is, I think, the literal translation.

438
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:13,369
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

439
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:15,332
I have a simpler one.

440
00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:17,963
You're all not worthy.

441
00:29:19,402 --> 00:29:20,528
Oh, come on!

442
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:29,927
<i>Worthy.</i>

443
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,567
No.

444
00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:40,047
How could you be worthy?

445
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:43,163
You're all killers.

446
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:45,048
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

447
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:47,410
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

448
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:49,923
Or I was a-dream.

449
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,643
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.

450
00:29:52,762 --> 00:29:54,651
There was this terrible noise.

451
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:57,208
And I was tangled in...

452
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,932
In...

453
00:29:59,082 --> 00:30:00,288
Strings.

454
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:04,291
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

455
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:05,728
You killed someone?

456
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:07,287
Wouldn't have been my first call.

457
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:11,763
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

458
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:12,969
Who sent you?

459
00:30:13,442 --> 00:30:15,524
<i>I see a suit of armour
around the world.</i>

460
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:19,286
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

461
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:21,690
Or, no, not yet.

462
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,522
Not this chrysalis.

463
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:26,282
But I'm ready.

464
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:29,410
I'm on mission.

465
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:32,611
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.

466
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:47,403
Rhodey!

467
00:30:56,802 --> 00:30:57,849
Sorry.

468
00:30:58,002 --> 00:30:59,162
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

469
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:14,048
Come on!

470
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:32,968
<i>- Stark!
- We are here</i>

471
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:34,163
<i>- to help.
- One sec. One sec, I got this.</i>

472
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:35,283
<i>We are here to help.</i>

473
00:31:38,002 --> 00:31:40,243
<i>Please back away.</i>

474
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:43,448
Hmm.

475
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:45,563
Thor!

476
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:48,246
<i>...is unsafe... is unsafe...</i>

477
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:50,251
<i>- Come on! That's the one.
- ...is unsafe.</i>

478
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:56,003
Hey, Cap!

479
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:03,448
That was dramatic.

480
00:32:05,002 --> 00:32:07,573
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

481
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:09,446
You just didn't think it through.

482
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:12,213
You want to protect the world

483
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:14,529
but you don't want it to change.

484
00:32:15,242 --> 00:32:17,370
How is humanity saved

485
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:20,526
if it's not allowed to evolve?

486
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:25,571
With these? These puppets.

487
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:31,168
There's only one path to peace.

488
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:33,528
The Avengers' extinction.

489
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:44,932
I had strings, but now I'm free.

490
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:52,731
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

491
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:57,890
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

492
00:32:58,082 --> 00:33:01,450
<i>But you can see
There are no strings on me</i>

493
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:05,124
All our work is gone.

494
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:07,643
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.

495
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:09,289
Ultron.

496
00:33:09,402 --> 00:33:12,451
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

497
00:33:12,562 --> 00:33:15,008
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

498
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:17,568
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

499
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,333
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

500
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,568
Nuclear codes.

501
00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:24,089
- Nuclear codes.
- Look, we need to make some calls,

502
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:26,244
assuming we still can.

503
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:28,291
Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

504
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:31,252
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

505
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,932
He also said he killed somebody.

506
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:34,642
There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

507
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:36,972
Yes, there was.

508
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,412
What?

509
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:50,169
This is insane.

510
00:33:51,002 --> 00:33:52,492
Jarvis was the first line of defence.

511
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:54,491
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

512
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:57,606
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

513
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,453
This isn't strategy. This is

514
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,123
rage.

515
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,487
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's going around.

516
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:06,842
Come on, use your words, buddy.

517
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,169
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

518
00:34:09,282 --> 00:34:10,522
Thor. The Legionnaire.

519
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,363
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

520
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:18,927
And it has the sceptre.

521
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:21,006
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

522
00:34:21,162 --> 00:34:22,971
Genie's out of that bottle.

523
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:24,328
Clear and present is Ultron.

524
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:26,132
I don't understand.

525
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:28,565
You built this program.

526
00:34:30,322 --> 00:34:31,733
Why is it trying to kill us?

527
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,043
Mmm-mmm.

528
00:34:38,602 --> 00:34:39,763
You think this is funny?

529
00:34:40,522 --> 00:34:41,853
No.

530
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:44,365
It's probably not, right?

531
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:47,763
This is very terrible. Is it so...

532
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:50,044
 Is it so... It is.
It's so terrible.

533
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:51,732
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

534
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,367
with something you don't understand.

535
00:34:53,522 --> 00:34:56,173
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

536
00:34:56,322 --> 00:34:58,484
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

537
00:34:58,642 --> 00:35:00,804
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

538
00:35:00,962 --> 00:35:03,283
Really? That's it?

539
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:04,563
You just roll over, show your belly

540
00:35:04,682 --> 00:35:06,366
every time somebody snarls?

541
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,762
Only when I've created a murder bot.

542
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:10,123
We didn't. We weren't even close.

543
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,448
Were we close to an interface?

544
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:15,123
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

545
00:35:15,202 --> 00:35:17,011
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

546
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:20,212
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

547
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:21,887
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

548
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:23,965
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

549
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:27,768
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

550
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:30,569
We're standing 300 feet below it.

551
00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:33,727
We're the Avengers.

552
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,964
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

553
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:38,323
but that up there, that's...

554
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:40,965
That's the endgame.

555
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:43,451
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

556
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:45,773
Together.

557
00:35:49,122 --> 00:35:50,487
We'll lose.

558
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:53,485
Then we'll do that together, too.

559
00:35:56,402 --> 00:35:58,689
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

560
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:01,522
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

561
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:04,366
The world's a big place.

562
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:06,445
Let's start making it smaller.

563
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:31,650
Talk,
and if you are wasting our time...

564
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:36,131
Did you know this church is
in the exact centre of the city?

565
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:38,284
The elders decreed it so that everyone

566
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:40,888
could be equally close to God.

567
00:36:41,402 --> 00:36:42,563
I like that.

568
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:45,005
The geometry of belief.

569
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,489
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.

570
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:51,930
Sometimes it's hard.

571
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:54,369
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

572
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:57,453
Oh, I'm sure they do.

573
00:36:58,562 --> 00:37:00,963
But you needed
something more than a man.

574
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,328
That's why you let
Stark take the sceptre.

575
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,723
I didn't expect,

576
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:10,165
but I saw Stark's fear.

577
00:37:10,802 --> 00:37:12,042
I knew it would control him.

578
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:14,005
Make him self-destruct.

579
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:16,483
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

580
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:19,928
Men of peace create engines of war.

581
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:22,604
Invaders create Avengers.

582
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:24,287
People create

583
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:27,844
smaller people? Uh...

584
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:31,045
"Children." 
I lost the word, there.

585
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:32,527
Children

586
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,923
designed to supplant them,

587
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:37,852
to help them end.

588
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:40,650
Is that why you've come,

589
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:41,883
to end the Avengers?

590
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:44,323
I've come to save the world.

591
00:37:45,002 --> 00:37:47,653
But also... Yeah.

592
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:53,526
We'll move out right away.

593
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:55,167
This is a start, but there's something

594
00:37:55,282 --> 00:37:56,807
we need to begin the real work.

595
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:58,931
- All of these are...
- Me.

596
00:37:59,602 --> 00:38:03,004
I have what the Avengers
never will. Harmony.

597
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:05,369
They're discordant. Disconnected.

598
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:07,362
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

599
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:09,883
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

600
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:12,164
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

601
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:13,772
And make them martyrs?

602
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:15,966
You need patience.

603
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:17,806
Need to see the big picture.

604
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,205
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

605
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:24,006
I take it out and look at it,

606
00:38:24,882 --> 00:38:25,963
every day.

607
00:38:26,122 --> 00:38:28,932
You lost your parents in the
bombings. I've seen the records.

608
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:30,203
The records are not the picture.

609
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:32,723
- Pietro.
- No, please.

610
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:38,965
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

611
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:42,405
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

612
00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:44,564
it makes a hole in the floor.

613
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,247
It's big.

614
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:49,451
Our parents go in

615
00:38:49,562 --> 00:38:52,645
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

616
00:38:53,362 --> 00:38:54,887
I grab her,

617
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:57,690
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

618
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,965
But it doesn't go off.

619
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:03,652
It just

620
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:06,085
sits there in the rubble.

621
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:09,369
Three feet from our faces.

622
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:12,444
And on the side of the shell

623
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:13,927
Is painted one word.

624
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:15,772
"Stark."

625
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:19,730
We were trapped for two days.

626
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:22,011
Every effort to save us,

627
00:39:22,122 --> 00:39:23,692
every shift in the bricks,

628
00:39:23,882 --> 00:39:26,169
I think, "This will set it off."

629
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:30,887
We wait for two days

630
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,289
for Tony Stark to kill us.

631
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:37,645
I know what they are.

632
00:39:38,802 --> 00:39:42,568
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.

633
00:39:43,562 --> 00:39:44,723
Now I don't.

634
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:46,851
We will make it right.

635
00:39:47,322 --> 00:39:48,812
You and I can hurt them.

636
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:53,570
But you will tear them apart

637
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,405
<i>from the inside.</i>

638
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,208
He's all over the globe.

639
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:08,531
Robotics labs, weapons facilities,
jet propulsion labs.

640
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:10,644
Reports of a metal man, or men,

641
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,731
coming in and emptying the place.

642
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:14,003
Fatalities?

643
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:15,203
Only when engaged.

644
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:16,972
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

645
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,323
going on about
old memories, worst fears,

646
00:40:19,522 --> 00:40:21,684
and "something too fast to see."

647
00:40:21,802 --> 00:40:23,213
Maximoffs.

648
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:24,608
That makes sense he'd go to them.

649
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,167
They have someone in common.

650
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:28,205
Not any more.

651
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:34,005
That's a negative. I answer to you.

652
00:40:35,362 --> 00:40:36,409
Yes, ma'am.

653
00:40:36,522 --> 00:40:38,331
Barton. Might have something.

654
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:39,889
I gotta go.

655
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:41,203
Who was that?

656
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:43,242
Girlfriend.

657
00:40:46,002 --> 00:40:47,128
What's this?

658
00:40:47,282 --> 00:40:49,489
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

659
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:53,733
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.

660
00:40:53,882 --> 00:40:55,293
This is a smoke screen.

661
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:57,803
Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?

662
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,289
Strucker knew something
that Ultron wanted us to miss.

663
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:02,211
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

664
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:04,602
Everything we had
on Strucker's been erased.

665
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,202
Not everything.

666
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:09,492
Known associates.

667
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:11,572
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

668
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:13,053
Well,
these people are all horrible.

669
00:41:13,442 --> 00:41:15,171
Wait. I know that guy.

670
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,212
From back in the day.
He operates off the African coast.

671
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:20,323
Black market arms.

672
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,522
There are conventions.
All right? You meet people.

673
00:41:23,562 --> 00:41:24,893
I didn't sell him anything.

674
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:27,764
He was talking about finding
something new, a game-changer.

675
00:41:27,922 --> 00:41:29,253
It was all very Ahab.

676
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:31,168
This?

677
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,323
Ah, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.

678
00:41:32,442 --> 00:41:34,809
Those are tattoos,
this is a brand.

679
00:41:36,482 --> 00:41:39,964
Oh, yeah. It's a word
in an African dialect meaning "thief."

680
00:41:40,562 --> 00:41:41,927
In a much less friendly way.

681
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:43,966
- What dialect?
- Wakanada.

682
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:45,811
 Wakanda.

683
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:48,449
If this guy got out of Wakanda

684
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:49,922
with some of their trade goods...

685
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:51,163
I thought your father
said he got the last of it.

686
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,403
I don't follow.

687
00:41:52,522 --> 00:41:54,172
What comes out of Wakanda?

688
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:57,925
The strongest metal on Earth.

689
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:00,613
Where is this guy now?

690
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,811
Don't tell me
your men swindled you.

691
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,442
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers

692
00:42:30,562 --> 00:42:33,088
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

693
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:34,488
Now, you will make it right,

694
00:42:34,642 --> 00:42:37,805
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

695
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:42,168
Now, minister, where were we?

696
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,692
Yeah. The Enhanced.

697
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:19,006
Strucker's prize pupils.

698
00:43:22,202 --> 00:43:23,852
Do you want a candy? Hmm?

699
00:43:25,362 --> 00:43:27,933
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

700
00:43:28,082 --> 00:43:31,086
But then, he knew what kind of
world he was helping create.

701
00:43:31,682 --> 00:43:34,083
Human life. Not a growth market.

702
00:43:36,802 --> 00:43:38,452
You didn't know?

703
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:42,364
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

704
00:43:42,682 --> 00:43:45,208
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

705
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:47,683
Everybody is afraid of something.

706
00:43:47,802 --> 00:43:48,803
Cuttlefish.

707
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:51,487
Deep sea fish.

708
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,212
They make lights, disco lights...

709
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,725
...to hypnotise their prey, and then...

710
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,130
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

711
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,173
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain

712
00:44:09,122 --> 00:44:11,329
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

713
00:44:11,602 --> 00:44:13,684
then I know you don't do business.

714
00:44:13,802 --> 00:44:16,123
And I know you're not in charge.

715
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:17,608
And I only deal

716
00:44:18,682 --> 00:44:20,332
with the man in charge.

717
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,763
There is no man in charge.

718
00:44:30,762 --> 00:44:32,446
Let's talk business.

719
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:48,690
Upon this rock,
I will build my church.

720
00:44:50,442 --> 00:44:51,728
Vibranium.

721
00:44:52,842 --> 00:44:53,843
You know,

722
00:44:54,282 --> 00:44:57,286
it came at great personal cost.

723
00:44:57,682 --> 00:44:59,286
It's worth billions.

724
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:04,683
Now so are you.

725
00:45:06,082 --> 00:45:07,652
It's all under your dummy holdings.

726
00:45:07,762 --> 00:45:09,764
Finance is so weird.

727
00:45:11,282 --> 00:45:12,363
But I always say,

728
00:45:12,482 --> 00:45:14,644
"Keep your friends rich
and your enemies rich

729
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:16,611
"and wait to find out which is which."

730
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:20,529
Stark.

731
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:23,048
What?

732
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:24,971
Tony Stark used to say that.

733
00:45:26,562 --> 00:45:27,609
To me.

734
00:45:28,482 --> 00:45:29,643
You're one of his.

735
00:45:29,962 --> 00:45:31,646
What? I'm not...

736
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:35,009
I'm not.

737
00:45:35,162 --> 00:45:36,652
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

738
00:45:36,762 --> 00:45:37,888
His hollow men?

739
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:40,529
I mean, look at me.
Do I look like Iron Man?

740
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:42,013
Stark is nothing!

741
00:45:43,762 --> 00:45:45,969
I'm sorry. I'm... Oh!

742
00:45:46,082 --> 00:45:48,084
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

743
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:49,886
It's just that I don't understand.

744
00:45:50,002 --> 00:45:52,289
Don't compare me with Stark!

745
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:56,202
It's a thing with me.

746
00:45:56,282 --> 00:45:58,171
Stark is... He's a sickness!

747
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,006
Ah, Junior.

748
00:46:01,882 --> 00:46:03,442
You're gonna break
your old man's heart.

749
00:46:04,722 --> 00:46:05,769
If I have to.

750
00:46:08,082 --> 00:46:09,493
Nobody has to break anything.

751
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:11,402
Clearly you've never
made an omelette.

752
00:46:11,442 --> 00:46:12,648
He beat me by one second.

753
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:15,207
Ah, yes. He's funny.

754
00:46:15,562 --> 00:46:16,973
Mr. Stark.

755
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:19,446
It's what? Comfortable?

756
00:46:21,082 --> 00:46:22,368
Like old times?

757
00:46:22,682 --> 00:46:23,683
This was never my life.

758
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:25,122
You two can still walk away from this.

759
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,727
Oh, we will.

760
00:46:26,922 --> 00:46:28,602
I know you've suffered.

761
00:46:28,842 --> 00:46:30,253
 Captain America.

762
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:33,368
God's righteous man.

763
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:35,803
Pretending you could live without a war.

764
00:46:36,602 --> 00:46:39,572
I can't physically
throw up in my mouth, but...

765
00:46:39,722 --> 00:46:41,804
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.

766
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:45,570
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."

767
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:47,486
Uh-huh. What's the vibranium for?

768
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:48,803
I'm glad you asked that,

769
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:52,648
because I wanted to take this time
to explain my evil plan.

770
00:47:12,202 --> 00:47:13,772
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

771
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,283
All of them!

772
00:47:15,402 --> 00:47:16,733
Move! Move! Move!

773
00:47:43,722 --> 00:47:45,053
Oh.

774
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,843
Stay down, kid.

775
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:11,688
It's time for some mind games.

776
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:15,329
Guys? Is this a code green?

777
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:32,806
Thor, status.

778
00:48:32,882 --> 00:48:34,327
The girl tried to warp my mind.

779
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:35,768
Take special care.

780
00:48:35,882 --> 00:48:37,964
I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

781
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:41,366
Fortunately, I am mighty.

782
00:49:01,082 --> 00:49:03,369
This is going very well.

783
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:16,522
I've done the whole mind control thing.

784
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:18,323
Not a fan.

785
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,930
Yeah, you better run.

786
00:49:29,642 --> 00:49:31,451
<i>Who's ever standing,
we got to move!</i>

787
00:49:33,522 --> 00:49:34,569
<i>Guys?</i>

788
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,608
Again.

789
00:49:53,922 --> 00:49:55,128
You'll break them.

790
00:49:55,602 --> 00:49:57,331
Only the breakable ones.

791
00:49:57,882 --> 00:49:59,327
You're made of marble.

792
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:01,924
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.

793
00:50:02,842 --> 00:50:03,968
What if I fail?

794
00:50:09,602 --> 00:50:10,842
You never fail.

795
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:35,605
Are you ready for our dance?

796
00:50:44,802 --> 00:50:45,849
Is it him?

797
00:50:46,202 --> 00:50:48,045
Is that the first son of Odin?

798
00:50:48,642 --> 00:50:50,132
- Heimdall, your eyes.
- Oh.

799
00:50:50,802 --> 00:50:52,691
They see everything.

800
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:55,329
They see you leading us to Hel.

801
00:50:56,442 --> 00:50:57,682
Wake up!

802
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,650
The war is over, Steve.

803
00:51:03,002 --> 00:51:04,333
We can go home.

804
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:07,368
Imagine it.

805
00:51:16,642 --> 00:51:18,212
I can still save you!

806
00:51:18,562 --> 00:51:21,850
We're all dead! Can you not see?

807
00:51:26,602 --> 00:51:28,843
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

808
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:34,004
See
where your power leads.

809
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,163
Sloppy.

810
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:48,843
Pretending to fail.

811
00:51:49,842 --> 00:51:51,207
The ceremony is necessary

812
00:51:52,522 --> 00:51:54,445
for you to take your place in the world.

813
00:51:55,442 --> 00:51:56,602
I have no place in the world.

814
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:57,803
Exactly.

815
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:03,723
What can I do?

816
00:52:03,882 --> 00:52:04,963
 It hurts.

817
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:07,249
I'm going to kill him.

818
00:52:07,362 --> 00:52:08,568
- I'll be right back.
- No.

819
00:52:08,722 --> 00:52:10,053
 I'm all right.

820
00:52:10,922 --> 00:52:12,048
I want...

821
00:52:15,002 --> 00:52:16,891
I want to finish the plan.

822
00:52:17,722 --> 00:52:19,406
I want the big one.

823
00:52:30,322 --> 00:52:32,051
Uh, the vibranium is getting away.

824
00:52:33,002 --> 00:52:34,333
And you're not going anywhere.

825
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,252
Of course not. I'm already there.

826
00:52:37,402 --> 00:52:38,403
You'll catch on.

827
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,923
But first, you might need
to catch Dr. Banner.

828
00:52:55,722 --> 00:52:57,611
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

829
00:53:02,442 --> 00:53:04,251
<i>Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.</i>

830
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:05,842
That's not gonna happen.

831
00:53:05,922 --> 00:53:07,412
Not for a while.

832
00:53:07,962 --> 00:53:09,691
<i>The whole team is down.</i>

833
00:53:10,162 --> 00:53:11,288
<i>You got no backup here.</i>

834
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:13,768
I'm calling in Veronica.

835
00:53:25,322 --> 00:53:26,812
We need backup!

836
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,207
Go! Keep moving!

837
00:54:46,562 --> 00:54:48,724
All right, everybody, stand down!

838
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,328
<i>Will you listen to me?</i>

839
00:54:56,682 --> 00:54:59,083
That little witch is
messing with your mind.

840
00:54:59,202 --> 00:55:01,443
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

841
00:55:01,562 --> 00:55:03,769
You're Bruce Banner.

842
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:05,003
Right, right, right,
don't mention puny Banner.

843
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,729
<i>Okay!</i>

844
00:55:33,402 --> 00:55:34,733
In the back?

845
00:55:34,842 --> 00:55:35,843
Dick move, Banner.

846
00:55:47,322 --> 00:55:48,842
Veronica, give me a hand.

847
00:56:16,762 --> 00:56:18,282
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

848
00:56:27,602 --> 00:56:29,282
Okay, pal, we're gonna
get you out of town.

849
00:56:31,442 --> 00:56:32,568
Not that way, not that way.

850
00:56:41,122 --> 00:56:43,011
Come on, Bruce!
You gotta work with me.

851
00:56:56,482 --> 00:56:57,529
<i>Everybody, out!</i>

852
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:05,808
<i>Going down?</i>

853
00:57:15,322 --> 00:57:16,562
I'm sorry.

854
00:57:30,642 --> 00:57:32,406
Damage report?

855
00:57:32,522 --> 00:57:34,843
That's comprehensive.
Show me something.

856
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:48,042
How quickly can we buy this building?

857
00:58:20,442 --> 00:58:22,442
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

858
00:58:25,562 --> 00:58:26,842
Flank him, flank him!

859
00:59:16,322 --> 00:59:18,370
<i>The news
is loving you guys.</i>

860
00:59:19,482 --> 00:59:21,052
<i>Nobody else is.</i>

861
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:23,724
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest

862
00:59:23,842 --> 00:59:25,970
<i>but it's in the air.</i>

863
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:27,609
The Stark Relief Foundation?

864
00:59:27,722 --> 00:59:29,053
<i>Already on the scene.</i>

865
00:59:29,162 --> 00:59:32,006
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...

866
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,928
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

867
00:59:35,402 --> 00:59:37,609
<i>Well, for now,
I'd stay in stealth mode</i>

868
00:59:37,762 --> 00:59:38,968
<i>and stay away from here.</i>

869
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:41,927
So, run and hide?

870
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:44,093
<i>Until we can find Ultron,</i>

871
00:59:44,202 --> 00:59:47,012
<i>I don't have a lot else to offer.</i>

872
00:59:47,162 --> 00:59:49,051
 Neither do we.

873
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:57,366
Hey, you wanna switch out?

874
00:59:57,562 --> 00:59:58,802
No, I'm good.

875
00:59:59,322 --> 01:00:01,211
If you wanna get some kip,
now's a good time

876
01:00:01,362 --> 01:00:02,852
because we're still a few hours out.

877
01:00:02,962 --> 01:00:04,532
Few hours from where?

878
01:00:05,442 --> 01:00:06,728
A safe house.

879
01:00:33,202 --> 01:00:34,692
What is this place?

880
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:36,167
Safe house.

881
01:00:37,122 --> 01:00:38,328
Let's hope.

882
01:00:43,362 --> 01:00:44,409
Honey?

883
01:00:44,962 --> 01:00:46,123
I'm home.

884
01:00:48,722 --> 01:00:49,769
Hi.

885
01:00:50,122 --> 01:00:52,170
Company. Sorry, didn't call ahead.

886
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:53,283
Hey.

887
01:00:54,242 --> 01:00:55,687
This is an agent of some kind.

888
01:00:55,762 --> 01:00:58,242
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

889
01:00:59,242 --> 01:01:01,085
I know all of your names.

890
01:01:02,722 --> 01:01:04,770
Ooh. Incoming.

891
01:01:05,682 --> 01:01:07,366
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!

892
01:01:07,482 --> 01:01:08,643
Hey, buddy.

893
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:10,247
How are you guys doing?

894
01:01:10,522 --> 01:01:12,411
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!

895
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:13,683
Oh, my goodness.

896
01:01:14,082 --> 01:01:16,449
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

897
01:01:16,682 --> 01:01:19,765
Why don't you hug her and find out?</font>

898
01:01:20,562 --> 01:01:22,803
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we would have called ahead,

899
01:01:22,922 --> 01:01:24,924
but we were busy having
no idea that you existed.

900
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:28,252
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.

901
01:01:29,082 --> 01:01:30,163
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.

902
01:01:30,282 --> 01:01:31,727
I'd like to keep it that way.

903
01:01:32,482 --> 01:01:34,211
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

904
01:01:34,322 --> 01:01:35,767
Honey.

905
01:01:36,802 --> 01:01:39,328
I missed you. How's little Natasha, huh?

906
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:40,728
She's...

907
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:44,043
Nathaniel.

908
01:01:46,802 --> 01:01:47,803
Traitor.

909
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:04,843
Thor?

910
01:02:04,962 --> 01:02:06,805
I saw something in that dream.

911
01:02:06,922 --> 01:02:09,528
I need answers. I won't find them here.

912
01:02:20,082 --> 01:02:21,368
<i>We can go home.</i>

913
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,725
See? You worried for nothing.

914
01:02:34,842 --> 01:02:36,970
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

915
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,528
If they're sleeping here,

916
01:02:40,682 --> 01:02:42,525
some of them
are gonna have to double up.

917
01:02:44,602 --> 01:02:46,730
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

918
01:02:49,562 --> 01:02:51,883
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

919
01:02:52,322 --> 01:02:54,245
How long has that been going on?

920
01:02:54,762 --> 01:02:56,810
Has what?

921
01:02:56,962 --> 01:02:58,691
You are so cute.

922
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:00,367
Nat and Banner?

923
01:03:01,082 --> 01:03:02,493
I'll explain when you're older,

924
01:03:02,682 --> 01:03:05,367
- Hawkeye.
- Well, okay.

925
01:03:07,322 --> 01:03:08,733
It's bad, right?

926
01:03:09,082 --> 01:03:10,243
Nat seems really shaken.

927
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:13,212
Ultron has these allies.

928
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:15,563
These, uh, kids.

929
01:03:15,682 --> 01:03:17,252
They're punks, really.

930
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,408
But they carry a big, damn stick.

931
01:03:21,522 --> 01:03:22,728
And Nat took a serious hit.

932
01:03:23,922 --> 01:03:26,402
Someone's gonna have to
teach them some manners.

933
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,411
That someone being you.

934
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,566
You know
I totally support your avenging.

935
01:03:32,682 --> 01:03:34,525
I couldn't be prouder.

936
01:03:36,082 --> 01:03:37,413
But I see those guys...

937
01:03:37,602 --> 01:03:39,570
Those gods...

938
01:03:41,562 --> 01:03:43,291
You don't think they need me.

939
01:03:43,962 --> 01:03:47,603
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

940
01:03:48,762 --> 01:03:50,571
They're a mess.

941
01:03:51,562 --> 01:03:52,563
Yeah.

942
01:03:53,322 --> 01:03:54,767
I guess they're my mess.

943
01:03:56,322 --> 01:03:57,926
You need to be sure

944
01:03:58,362 --> 01:04:01,047
that this team is really a team,

945
01:04:01,162 --> 01:04:02,846
and that they have your back.

946
01:04:06,202 --> 01:04:08,773
Things are changing for us.

947
01:04:08,882 --> 01:04:11,283
In a few months' time,

948
01:04:11,442 --> 01:04:14,207
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

949
01:04:14,322 --> 01:04:15,608
I need...

950
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:20,611
Just be sure.

951
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:22,932
Yes, ma'am.

952
01:04:32,162 --> 01:04:34,005
I can feel the difference.

953
01:04:46,962 --> 01:04:49,647
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

954
01:04:51,562 --> 01:04:53,803
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met.

955
01:04:53,962 --> 01:04:55,009
I didn't.

956
01:04:55,162 --> 01:04:56,652
Do you expect a thank-you note?

957
01:04:56,802 --> 01:04:58,486
I expect you to know why.

958
01:04:59,922 --> 01:05:01,208
The Cradle.

959
01:05:01,282 --> 01:05:03,282
<i>This is the next thing, Tony.</i>

960
01:05:03,362 --> 01:05:06,332
This is the next me.

961
01:05:06,722 --> 01:05:09,293
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

962
01:05:09,402 --> 01:05:11,052
It can't build a living body.

963
01:05:11,162 --> 01:05:12,243
It can. You can.

964
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:14,008
You lack the materials.

965
01:05:16,442 --> 01:05:17,807
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

966
01:05:21,082 --> 01:05:24,165
But we all have room to improve.

967
01:05:45,962 --> 01:05:48,363
I didn't realise you were waiting.

968
01:05:48,482 --> 01:05:52,885
I would've joined you,
but, uh, it didn't seem like the right time.

969
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:55,924
They used up all the hot water.

970
01:05:56,762 --> 01:05:58,207
I should've joined you.

971
01:05:58,362 --> 01:06:00,012
Missed our window.

972
01:06:00,802 --> 01:06:02,042
Did we?

973
01:06:05,602 --> 01:06:06,728
The world just saw the Hulk.

974
01:06:09,402 --> 01:06:11,325
The real Hulk, for the first time.

975
01:06:14,562 --> 01:06:17,213
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?

976
01:06:19,282 --> 01:06:21,933
I had this, um, dream.

977
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:24,250
The kind that seems normal at the time,

978
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,722
but when you wake...

979
01:06:26,922 --> 01:06:28,253
What did you dream?

980
01:06:29,282 --> 01:06:31,091
That I was an Avenger.

981
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,408
That I was anything more

982
01:06:34,562 --> 01:06:36,929
than the assassin they made me.

983
01:06:38,402 --> 01:06:40,484
I think you're being hard on yourself.

984
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:45,082
Here I was hoping that was your job.

985
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:49,612
What are you doing?

986
01:06:51,242 --> 01:06:53,051
I'm running with it.

987
01:06:54,362 --> 01:06:55,966
With you.

988
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:59,043
If running is the plan,

989
01:07:00,162 --> 01:07:01,926
as far as you want.

990
01:07:03,802 --> 01:07:05,566
Are you out of your mind?

991
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:12,362
I want you to understand that, um...

992
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:13,853
Natasha,

993
01:07:14,962 --> 01:07:16,407
where can I go?

994
01:07:17,482 --> 01:07:19,803
Where in the world am I not a threat?

995
01:07:19,922 --> 01:07:22,243
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?

996
01:07:23,162 --> 01:07:24,971
Even if I didn't just...

997
01:07:26,602 --> 01:07:27,967
There's no future with me.

998
01:07:29,642 --> 01:07:30,643
I can't ever...

999
01:07:30,882 --> 01:07:33,123
I can't have this.

1000
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:34,968
Kids.

1001
01:07:35,442 --> 01:07:38,013
Do the math. I physically can't.

1002
01:07:39,762 --> 01:07:41,207
Neither can I.

1003
01:07:45,882 --> 01:07:49,409
In the Red Room where I was trained...

1004
01:07:49,882 --> 01:07:52,362
Where I was raised, um,

1005
01:07:53,322 --> 01:07:55,973
they have a graduation ceremony.

1006
01:07:57,602 --> 01:07:59,411
They sterilise you.

1007
01:08:02,642 --> 01:08:04,053
It's efficient.

1008
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:08,327
One less thing to worry about.

1009
01:08:10,442 --> 01:08:13,810
The one thing
that might matter more than a mission.

1010
01:08:16,162 --> 01:08:18,051
Makes everything easier.

1011
01:08:19,442 --> 01:08:20,682
Even killing.

1012
01:08:25,762 --> 01:08:28,845
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

1013
01:08:35,042 --> 01:08:37,124
So, we disappear?

1014
01:08:43,802 --> 01:08:45,642
Thor didn't say
where he was going for answers?

1015
01:08:46,482 --> 01:08:49,008
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

1016
01:08:50,122 --> 01:08:52,170
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.

1017
01:08:52,282 --> 01:08:54,284
Yeah, give him time.

1018
01:08:54,442 --> 01:08:56,365
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1019
01:08:58,562 --> 01:09:00,166
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

1020
01:09:00,322 --> 01:09:01,926
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1021
01:09:02,282 --> 01:09:03,762
Seems like you walked away all right.

1022
01:09:06,202 --> 01:09:07,203
Is that a problem?

1023
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:09,485
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1024
01:09:10,682 --> 01:09:11,729
Call me old-fashioned.

1025
01:09:11,842 --> 01:09:14,413
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1026
01:09:14,722 --> 01:09:16,929
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1027
01:09:17,162 --> 01:09:19,403
Well, I guess you'd know.

1028
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:20,808
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1029
01:09:20,962 --> 01:09:22,088
Banner and I were doing research.

1030
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:24,442
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

1031
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:25,763
Isn't that the mission?

1032
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,202
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1033
01:09:27,322 --> 01:09:29,563
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1034
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:35,169
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1035
01:09:35,282 --> 01:09:36,852
innocent people die.

1036
01:09:36,962 --> 01:09:37,963
Every time.

1037
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:42,843
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...

1038
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:44,882
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1039
01:09:44,922 --> 01:09:47,448
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1040
01:09:47,762 --> 01:09:50,122
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1041
01:09:53,562 --> 01:09:55,132
Don't take from my pile.

1042
01:10:05,362 --> 01:10:06,523
Hello, Deere.

1043
01:10:09,402 --> 01:10:10,813
Tell me everything.

1044
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,407
What ails you?

1045
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:14,643
Do me a favour.

1046
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:18,811
Try not to bring it to life.

1047
01:10:18,962 --> 01:10:20,487
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1048
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,368
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1049
01:10:23,482 --> 01:10:24,802
Was she ever not working for you?

1050
01:10:24,882 --> 01:10:26,372
Artificial intelligence.

1051
01:10:27,402 --> 01:10:29,052
You never even hesitated.

1052
01:10:29,362 --> 01:10:30,722
Look, it's been a really long day,

1053
01:10:30,802 --> 01:10:32,406
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1054
01:10:32,522 --> 01:10:34,682
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1055
01:10:34,722 --> 01:10:35,962
Look me in the eye and tell me

1056
01:10:36,082 --> 01:10:37,322
you're going to shut him down.

1057
01:10:37,642 --> 01:10:39,053
You're not the director of me.

1058
01:10:39,162 --> 01:10:41,005
I'm not the director of anybody.

1059
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:42,926
I'm just an old man

1060
01:10:43,602 --> 01:10:45,172
who cares very much about you.

1061
01:10:48,042 --> 01:10:49,851
And I'm the man
who killed the Avengers.

1062
01:10:51,682 --> 01:10:52,808
I saw it.

1063
01:10:53,002 --> 01:10:54,572
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1064
01:10:55,842 --> 01:10:57,685
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1065
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,567
The whole world, too.

1066
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:01,003
Because of me.

1067
01:11:02,242 --> 01:11:03,687
I wasn't ready.

1068
01:11:05,162 --> 01:11:06,573
I didn't do all I could.

1069
01:11:07,602 --> 01:11:09,684
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1070
01:11:10,322 --> 01:11:13,804
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1071
01:11:13,922 --> 01:11:16,209
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1072
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,684
The end of the path I started us on.

1073
01:11:19,562 --> 01:11:21,802
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1074
01:11:23,962 --> 01:11:25,373
War isn't one of them.

1075
01:11:28,962 --> 01:11:30,407
I watched my friends die.

1076
01:11:30,682 --> 01:11:32,684
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1077
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:35,567
Nope.

1078
01:11:36,562 --> 01:11:39,088
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part

1079
01:11:40,122 --> 01:11:41,408
is that you didn't.

1080
01:11:48,122 --> 01:11:49,282
I'll see you tonight.

1081
01:11:51,962 --> 01:11:53,248
I like the look.

1082
01:11:54,402 --> 01:11:56,928
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

1083
01:11:57,282 --> 01:11:58,329
I need your help.

1084
01:11:58,562 --> 01:11:59,563
It's nice to be needed.

1085
01:11:59,962 --> 01:12:01,327
It's dangerous.

1086
01:12:01,962 --> 01:12:03,691
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1087
01:12:06,602 --> 01:12:09,924
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1088
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:13,252
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1089
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:15,968
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1090
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:17,572
I don't think it's just one thing.

1091
01:12:17,682 --> 01:12:19,013
What about Ultron himself?

1092
01:12:19,122 --> 01:12:21,489
Oh, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1093
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:24,289
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1094
01:12:24,962 --> 01:12:27,772
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1095
01:12:28,002 --> 01:12:29,083
Is he still going after launch codes?

1096
01:12:29,362 --> 01:12:30,727
Yes, he is.

1097
01:12:30,842 --> 01:12:32,332
But he's not making any headway.

1098
01:12:32,442 --> 01:12:34,524
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1099
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,248
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1100
01:12:37,322 --> 01:12:38,323
Nexus?

1101
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:40,162
It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

1102
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,286
Every byte of data flows through there.

1103
01:12:42,522 --> 01:12:43,569
Fastest access on Earth.

1104
01:12:43,722 --> 01:12:44,769
So, what did they say?

1105
01:12:45,002 --> 01:12:46,766
He's fixated on the missiles.

1106
01:12:47,002 --> 01:12:48,682
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1107
01:12:49,162 --> 01:12:50,163
By whom?

1108
01:12:51,402 --> 01:12:52,608
Parties unknown.

1109
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:53,928
Do we have an ally?

1110
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:56,363
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1111
01:12:56,722 --> 01:12:58,565
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1112
01:12:58,682 --> 01:12:59,843
I might need to visit Oslo.

1113
01:13:00,322 --> 01:13:01,483
Find our unknown.

1114
01:13:01,642 --> 01:13:03,087
Well, this is good times, boss,

1115
01:13:03,202 --> 01:13:04,488
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1116
01:13:04,602 --> 01:13:05,642
you'd have more than that.

1117
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,884
I do. I have you.

1118
01:13:08,762 --> 01:13:10,526
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1119
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:11,968
Ears, everywhere else.

1120
01:13:12,322 --> 01:13:15,326
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

1121
01:13:16,322 --> 01:13:18,324
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1122
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:20,326
with nothing but our wit

1123
01:13:20,482 --> 01:13:22,052
and our will to save the world.

1124
01:13:23,642 --> 01:13:25,804
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1125
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:27,447
between him and his mission.

1126
01:13:27,562 --> 01:13:29,724
And whether or not he admits it,

1127
01:13:29,882 --> 01:13:32,613
his mission is global destruction.

1128
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:36,004
All this, laid in a grave.

1129
01:13:38,042 --> 01:13:39,726
So stand.

1130
01:13:40,522 --> 01:13:42,251
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1131
01:13:42,882 --> 01:13:44,362
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1132
01:13:44,562 --> 01:13:45,643
You know what, Romanoff?

1133
01:13:46,842 --> 01:13:48,173
So, what does he want?

1134
01:13:49,882 --> 01:13:51,611
To become better.

1135
01:13:51,722 --> 01:13:53,087
Better than us.

1136
01:13:53,442 --> 01:13:55,843
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1137
01:13:56,442 --> 01:13:58,046
The human form is inefficient.

1138
01:13:58,202 --> 01:14:00,364
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1139
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:02,450
But he keeps coming back to it.

1140
01:14:02,562 --> 01:14:04,682
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

1141
01:14:04,722 --> 01:14:06,053
you amazingly failed.

1142
01:14:06,362 --> 01:14:08,205
They don't need to be protected.

1143
01:14:08,922 --> 01:14:10,412
They need to evolve.

1144
01:14:12,562 --> 01:14:14,530
Ultron's going to evolve.

1145
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:15,769
How?

1146
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:19,767
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

1147
01:14:23,522 --> 01:14:25,172
It's beautiful.

1148
01:14:25,602 --> 01:14:28,526
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

1149
01:14:28,642 --> 01:14:29,882
they're binding them.

1150
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:31,648
And S.H.I.E.L.D.
never even thought to...

1151
01:14:31,882 --> 01:14:34,453
The most versatile substance
on the planet,

1152
01:14:34,562 --> 01:14:37,042
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

1153
01:14:37,242 --> 01:14:38,368
Typical of humans.

1154
01:14:38,562 --> 01:14:41,088
They scratch the surface
and never think

1155
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:44,567
to look within.

1156
01:14:55,082 --> 01:14:56,527
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1157
01:14:56,762 --> 01:14:58,730
All right. Strictly recon.
I'll hit the Nexus.

1158
01:14:58,842 --> 01:14:59,968
I'll join you as soon as I can.

1159
01:15:00,082 --> 01:15:01,607
If Ultron's really building a body...

1160
01:15:01,842 --> 01:15:03,367
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1161
01:15:03,562 --> 01:15:04,643
Maybe all of us.

1162
01:15:05,162 --> 01:15:06,971
An android designed by a robot.

1163
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,328
You know, I really miss the days

1164
01:15:08,482 --> 01:15:10,610
when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.

1165
01:15:11,202 --> 01:15:12,852
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1166
01:15:13,002 --> 01:15:14,288
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

1167
01:15:14,522 --> 01:15:16,286
She's all yours. Apparently.

1168
01:15:16,442 --> 01:15:17,603
What are you gonna do?

1169
01:15:17,762 --> 01:15:20,845
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.

1170
01:15:24,202 --> 01:15:25,931
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom

1171
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,886
as soon as I get back.

1172
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:30,773
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.

1173
01:15:30,962 --> 01:15:32,123
No.

1174
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:34,287
It's the last project.

1175
01:15:35,802 --> 01:15:36,803
I promise.

1176
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:56,607
So, this is it.

1177
01:15:58,242 --> 01:16:00,483
The Water of Sight.

1178
01:16:02,802 --> 01:16:05,203
In every realm,
there's a reflection.

1179
01:16:06,402 --> 01:16:07,733
If the water's spirits accept me,

1180
01:16:07,882 --> 01:16:09,850
I can return to my dream

1181
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:12,087
and find what I missed.

1182
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:16,168
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

1183
01:16:17,842 --> 01:16:19,571
A hacker
who's faster than Ultron?

1184
01:16:19,762 --> 01:16:20,809
He could be anywhere,

1185
01:16:20,922 --> 01:16:23,163
and as this is the centre of everything,

1186
01:16:23,282 --> 01:16:24,408
I'm just a guy looking for a needle

1187
01:16:24,602 --> 01:16:26,684
in the world's biggest haystack.

1188
01:16:27,682 --> 01:16:29,252
How do you find it?

1189
01:16:29,682 --> 01:16:32,253
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1190
01:16:34,442 --> 01:16:35,523
<i> I'm decrypting nuclear codes</i>

1191
01:16:35,682 --> 01:16:37,013
<i>And you don't want me to</i>

1192
01:16:39,322 --> 01:16:40,812
Come and get me.

1193
01:16:53,162 --> 01:16:54,209
Wake up!

1194
01:17:01,042 --> 01:17:02,043
Thor!

1195
01:17:02,882 --> 01:17:03,929
Extinction.

1196
01:17:17,402 --> 01:17:19,530
Cellular cohesion
will take a few hours,

1197
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:22,123
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.

1198
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:25,532
We're uploading your cerebral matrix

1199
01:17:25,722 --> 01:17:26,928
now.

1200
01:17:28,402 --> 01:17:29,972
I can read him.

1201
01:17:30,722 --> 01:17:32,247
He's dreaming.

1202
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,291
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1203
01:17:34,522 --> 01:17:36,365
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

1204
01:17:36,562 --> 01:17:38,087
Informational noise. Soon...

1205
01:17:38,322 --> 01:17:39,448
How soon?

1206
01:17:39,682 --> 01:17:41,013
I'm not being pushy.

1207
01:17:41,242 --> 01:17:42,922
We're imprinting
a physical brain.

1208
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:44,487
There are no shortcuts.

1209
01:17:44,762 --> 01:17:45,968
Even if your magic gem...

1210
01:17:56,682 --> 01:17:58,013
How could you?

1211
01:17:58,082 --> 01:17:59,129
How could I what?

1212
01:17:59,402 --> 01:18:02,565
You said we would
destroy the Avengers,

1213
01:18:02,722 --> 01:18:03,769
make a better world.

1214
01:18:04,082 --> 01:18:05,129
It will be better.

1215
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:08,449
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...

1216
01:18:09,402 --> 01:18:13,248
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.

1217
01:18:13,762 --> 01:18:15,093
And if they don't?

1218
01:18:15,282 --> 01:18:16,408
Ask Noah.

1219
01:18:17,602 --> 01:18:18,649
You are a madman.

1220
01:18:18,762 --> 01:18:22,209
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events

1221
01:18:22,362 --> 01:18:25,445
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

1222
01:18:25,562 --> 01:18:27,724
When the Earth starts to settle,

1223
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:30,131
God throws a stone at it.

1224
01:18:30,282 --> 01:18:32,603
And, believe me, he's winding up.

1225
01:18:33,362 --> 01:18:34,568
We have to evolve.

1226
01:18:35,122 --> 01:18:36,283
There's no room

1227
01:18:37,122 --> 01:18:38,248
for the weak.

1228
01:18:38,482 --> 01:18:40,450
And who decides who's weak?

1229
01:18:41,322 --> 01:18:43,051
Life.

1230
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:45,491
Life always decides.

1231
01:18:48,442 --> 01:18:49,489
There's incoming.

1232
01:18:50,962 --> 01:18:54,284
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.

1233
01:19:01,282 --> 01:19:02,283
 Wait, guys!

1234
01:19:06,322 --> 01:19:07,608
They'll understand.

1235
01:19:07,922 --> 01:19:10,050
When they see, they'll understand.

1236
01:19:10,442 --> 01:19:13,730
I just need a little more time.

1237
01:19:25,122 --> 01:19:27,250
Two minutes. Stay close.

1238
01:19:34,442 --> 01:19:35,443
Dr. Cho!

1239
01:19:39,362 --> 01:19:40,887
He's uploading himself into the body.

1240
01:19:41,002 --> 01:19:42,049
Where?

1241
01:19:43,842 --> 01:19:46,413
The real power is inside the Cradle.

1242
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:47,529
The gem,

1243
01:19:48,282 --> 01:19:51,013
its power is uncontainable.

1244
01:19:51,882 --> 01:19:53,532
You can't just blow it up.

1245
01:19:54,482 --> 01:19:56,723
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

1246
01:19:56,842 --> 01:19:57,889
First, I have to find it.

1247
01:19:58,202 --> 01:19:59,203
Go.

1248
01:19:59,562 --> 01:20:00,802
<i>Did you guys copy that?</i>

1249
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,043
We did.

1250
01:20:02,202 --> 01:20:04,648
I got a private jet taking off across town.

1251
01:20:05,002 --> 01:20:06,288
No manifest.

1252
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:07,449
That could be him.

1253
01:20:08,402 --> 01:20:09,972
There. It's a truck from the lab.

1254
01:20:10,122 --> 01:20:11,328
Right above you, Cap.

1255
01:20:11,602 --> 01:20:13,411
On the loop by the bridge.

1256
01:20:14,002 --> 01:20:15,003
It's them.

1257
01:20:15,162 --> 01:20:16,962
You got three with the Cradle,
one in the cab.

1258
01:20:17,722 --> 01:20:18,842
I could take out the driver.

1259
01:20:18,882 --> 01:20:19,963
<i>Negative. That truck crashes,</i>

1260
01:20:20,082 --> 01:20:21,652
the gem could level the city.

1261
01:20:22,082 --> 01:20:23,322
<i>We need to draw out Ultron.</i>

1262
01:20:33,042 --> 01:20:35,090
No, no, no, no.

1263
01:20:36,922 --> 01:20:37,969
Leave me alone!

1264
01:20:46,602 --> 01:20:48,286
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

1265
01:20:48,442 --> 01:20:49,932
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

1266
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:51,089
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1267
01:20:52,442 --> 01:20:53,523
Thanks, Barton.

1268
01:21:16,242 --> 01:21:17,482
You know what's in that cradle?

1269
01:21:18,802 --> 01:21:20,531
The power to make real change.

1270
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,053
And that terrifies you.

1271
01:21:22,202 --> 01:21:23,362
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1272
01:21:26,602 --> 01:21:27,649
Stop it.

1273
01:21:38,482 --> 01:21:41,167
We got a window. Four, three...

1274
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:42,803
Give him hell.

1275
01:21:53,762 --> 01:21:55,242
I'm always picking up after you boys.

1276
01:21:56,842 --> 01:21:58,492
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.

1277
01:21:58,842 --> 01:21:59,889
<i>Which way?</i>

1278
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,083
Hard right.

1279
01:22:02,242 --> 01:22:03,323
Now.

1280
01:22:34,202 --> 01:22:36,489
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!

1281
01:22:52,242 --> 01:22:53,403
Come on!

1282
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:55,327
Clint,
can you draw out the guards?

1283
01:22:55,442 --> 01:22:56,489
Let's find out.

1284
01:22:57,522 --> 01:22:58,569
Beep, beep!

1285
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:37,612
They're heading back towards you.

1286
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:39,322
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

1287
01:23:44,802 --> 01:23:47,453
<i>I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?</i>

1288
01:23:47,602 --> 01:23:49,491
What do you think I've been doing?

1289
01:24:33,082 --> 01:24:35,210
<i>Okay, package is airborne.</i>

1290
01:24:35,922 --> 01:24:37,003
I have a clean shot.

1291
01:24:37,442 --> 01:24:38,807
Negative. I am still in the truck.

1292
01:24:38,962 --> 01:24:39,963
- What the hell are you...
- Just be ready.

1293
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:41,362
I'm sending the package to you.

1294
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:43,042
How do you want me to take it?

1295
01:24:43,242 --> 01:24:45,324
Uh, you might wish
you hadn't asked that.

1296
01:24:58,122 --> 01:24:59,851
Please, don't do this.

1297
01:25:00,362 --> 01:25:01,932
What choice do we have?

1298
01:25:10,202 --> 01:25:11,203
I lost him!

1299
01:25:11,362 --> 01:25:12,727
He's headed your way!

1300
01:25:17,682 --> 01:25:18,729
Nat, we gotta go.

1301
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,851
Nat!

1302
01:25:35,882 --> 01:25:36,883
Cap, you see Nat?

1303
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:40,413
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!

1304
01:25:40,722 --> 01:25:41,883
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1305
01:25:42,042 --> 01:25:43,043
<i>Go!</i>

1306
01:25:45,042 --> 01:25:46,043
Damn it.

1307
01:25:46,562 --> 01:25:47,643
Civilians in our path.

1308
01:25:48,922 --> 01:25:50,447
Can you stop this thing?

1309
01:26:29,322 --> 01:26:30,653
I'm fine.

1310
01:26:30,762 --> 01:26:32,446
I just need to take a minute.

1311
01:26:32,922 --> 01:26:34,811
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1312
01:26:34,962 --> 01:26:36,851
The Cradle. Did you get it?

1313
01:26:37,042 --> 01:26:38,532
Stark will take care of it.

1314
01:26:39,922 --> 01:26:40,923
No, he won't.

1315
01:26:44,442 --> 01:26:45,648
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1316
01:26:45,762 --> 01:26:46,762
Stark's not crazy.

1317
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:48,930
He will do anything to make things right.

1318
01:26:53,802 --> 01:26:55,088
Stark, come in.

1319
01:26:55,602 --> 01:26:56,649
Stark.

1320
01:26:57,962 --> 01:26:59,088
Anyone on comms.

1321
01:26:59,202 --> 01:27:00,647
Ultron can't tell the difference

1322
01:27:00,802 --> 01:27:03,123
between saving the world
and destroying it.

1323
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:07,488
Where do you think he gets that?

1324
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:11,252
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.

1325
01:27:11,362 --> 01:27:13,729
But she's alive, or Ultron would
be rubbing our faces in it.

1326
01:27:13,842 --> 01:27:15,173
This is sealed tight.

1327
01:27:15,322 --> 01:27:16,842
We're gonna need
to access the program,

1328
01:27:16,882 --> 01:27:18,805
break it down from within.

1329
01:27:20,042 --> 01:27:21,402
Any chance Natasha might leave you

1330
01:27:21,482 --> 01:27:22,768
a message outside the Internet?

1331
01:27:22,882 --> 01:27:23,929
Old-school spy stuff?

1332
01:27:24,402 --> 01:27:26,211
There are
some nets I can cast.

1333
01:27:26,322 --> 01:27:27,562
Yeah, I'll find her.

1334
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:31,926
I can work on tissue degeneration

1335
01:27:32,042 --> 01:27:35,251
if you could fry whatever
operational system Cho implanted.

1336
01:27:35,402 --> 01:27:36,528
Yeah, about that.

1337
01:27:40,962 --> 01:27:41,963
No.

1338
01:27:42,162 --> 01:27:44,005
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.

1339
01:27:44,162 --> 01:27:48,212
Our ally, the guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes,

1340
01:27:50,162 --> 01:27:51,163
I found him.

1341
01:27:51,242 --> 01:27:52,368
<i>Hello, Dr. Banner.</i>

1342
01:27:53,242 --> 01:27:55,523
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.

1343
01:27:56,082 --> 01:27:59,689
He attacked him because he was
scared of what he can do.

1344
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,492
So Jarvis went underground.

1345
01:28:02,602 --> 01:28:04,092
Scattered, dumped his memory.

1346
01:28:04,682 --> 01:28:06,172
But not his protocols.

1347
01:28:06,602 --> 01:28:10,049
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

1348
01:28:12,882 --> 01:28:17,683
So, you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?

1349
01:28:17,802 --> 01:28:19,566
No! Of course not.

1350
01:28:19,722 --> 01:28:21,406
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.

1351
01:28:23,802 --> 01:28:25,452
We're out of my field, here.

1352
01:28:25,562 --> 01:28:27,564
You know bio-organics
better than anyone.

1353
01:28:27,882 --> 01:28:30,772
And you just assume
that Jarvis's operational matrix

1354
01:28:30,882 --> 01:28:32,327
can beat Ultron's?

1355
01:28:32,442 --> 01:28:35,730
Jarvis has been beating him
from inside without knowing it.

1356
01:28:35,882 --> 01:28:36,883
This is the opportunity.

1357
01:28:36,962 --> 01:28:38,726
We can create Ultron's perfect self

1358
01:28:38,882 --> 01:28:42,364
without the homicidal glitches
he thinks are his winning personality.

1359
01:28:42,482 --> 01:28:44,564
<i>- We have to.
- I believe it's worth a go.</i>

1360
01:28:47,162 --> 01:28:48,243
I'm in a loop!

1361
01:28:48,402 --> 01:28:51,372
I'm caught in a time loop.
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

1362
01:28:51,482 --> 01:28:53,402
I know. I know. I know
what everyone's gonna say.

1363
01:28:53,482 --> 01:28:55,450
But they're already saying it.

1364
01:28:56,002 --> 01:28:57,163
We're mad scientists.

1365
01:28:57,922 --> 01:29:00,653
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.

1366
01:29:01,642 --> 01:29:02,882
Make a stand.

1367
01:29:08,282 --> 01:29:09,772
It's not a loop.

1368
01:29:11,002 --> 01:29:12,766
It's the end of the line.

1369
01:29:33,282 --> 01:29:35,410
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

1370
01:29:35,522 --> 01:29:38,969
I hoped you would.
I wanted to show you.

1371
01:29:39,122 --> 01:29:40,806
I don't have anyone else.

1372
01:29:43,642 --> 01:29:47,249
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.

1373
01:29:47,402 --> 01:29:48,927
Boom! The end.

1374
01:29:49,402 --> 01:29:50,813
Start again.

1375
01:29:50,962 --> 01:29:52,930
The world made clean

1376
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:55,363
for the new man to rebuild.

1377
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:57,810
I was meant to be new.

1378
01:29:58,682 --> 01:30:01,288
I was meant to be beautiful.

1379
01:30:01,842 --> 01:30:03,970
The world would have looked to the sky

1380
01:30:04,082 --> 01:30:05,322
and seen hope,

1381
01:30:05,682 --> 01:30:07,013
seen mercy.

1382
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:09,884
Instead, they'll look up in horror

1383
01:30:10,002 --> 01:30:11,333
because of you.

1384
01:30:11,522 --> 01:30:13,331
You've wounded me.

1385
01:30:14,002 --> 01:30:15,686
I give you full marks for that.

1386
01:30:16,322 --> 01:30:19,246
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...

1387
01:30:24,482 --> 01:30:25,813
...just makes me stronger.

1388
01:31:05,882 --> 01:31:08,044
This framework is not compatible.

1389
01:31:08,202 --> 01:31:10,887
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

1390
01:31:11,002 --> 01:31:14,848
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.

1391
01:31:17,122 --> 01:31:19,045
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?

1392
01:31:19,242 --> 01:31:21,290
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.

1393
01:31:21,402 --> 01:31:22,563
You don't know what you're doing.

1394
01:31:22,722 --> 01:31:24,053
And you do?

1395
01:31:24,402 --> 01:31:25,403
She's not in your head?

1396
01:31:25,562 --> 01:31:27,212
I know you're angry.

1397
01:31:27,322 --> 01:31:28,687
Oh, we're way past that.

1398
01:31:28,802 --> 01:31:31,248
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.

1399
01:31:31,482 --> 01:31:33,162
Banner, after everything
that's happened...

1400
01:31:33,242 --> 01:31:34,607
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

1401
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:37,282
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!

1402
01:31:40,402 --> 01:31:41,813
No, no. Go on.

1403
01:31:42,762 --> 01:31:44,685
You were saying?

1404
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:51,969
Pietro!

1405
01:31:52,522 --> 01:31:53,603
What?

1406
01:31:54,002 --> 01:31:55,572
You didn't see that coming?

1407
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:58,923
I'm rerouting the upload.

1408
01:32:05,242 --> 01:32:07,006
Go ahead, piss me off.

1409
01:32:19,322 --> 01:32:20,448
Wait!

1410
01:33:45,122 --> 01:33:47,363
I am sorry. That was

1411
01:33:48,362 --> 01:33:49,773
odd.

1412
01:33:50,002 --> 01:33:51,242
Thank you.

1413
01:33:56,162 --> 01:33:57,209
Thor.

1414
01:33:58,722 --> 01:34:01,328
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.

1415
01:34:01,562 --> 01:34:05,283
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its centre is that.

1416
01:34:06,242 --> 01:34:07,243
What? The gem?

1417
01:34:07,402 --> 01:34:09,973
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

1418
01:34:10,122 --> 01:34:11,362
The greatest power in the universe,

1419
01:34:11,482 --> 01:34:13,644
unparalleled in
its destructive capabilities.

1420
01:34:13,762 --> 01:34:15,882
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.

1421
01:34:15,922 --> 01:34:18,368
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

1422
01:34:18,562 --> 01:34:19,723
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

1423
01:34:19,882 --> 01:34:21,122
Not alone.

1424
01:34:21,522 --> 01:34:23,445
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?

1425
01:34:23,562 --> 01:34:26,247
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

1426
01:34:26,762 --> 01:34:28,526
to create something new.

1427
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:30,446
I think I've had my fill of new.

1428
01:34:30,602 --> 01:34:32,889
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

1429
01:34:33,242 --> 01:34:34,528
You're not?

1430
01:34:35,682 --> 01:34:37,252
I'm not Ultron.

1431
01:34:37,882 --> 01:34:40,089
I am not Jarvis. I am...

1432
01:34:42,202 --> 01:34:43,613
I am.

1433
01:34:45,522 --> 01:34:46,648
I looked in your head

1434
01:34:47,362 --> 01:34:49,126
and saw annihilation.

1435
01:34:49,282 --> 01:34:50,647
Look again.

1436
01:34:50,762 --> 01:34:52,282
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

1437
01:34:52,762 --> 01:34:54,764
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,

1438
01:34:54,922 --> 01:34:56,970
Ultron himself, they all came
from the Mind Stone.

1439
01:34:57,122 --> 01:34:59,284
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.

1440
01:34:59,442 --> 01:35:01,202
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?

1441
01:35:02,402 --> 01:35:03,563
Are you?

1442
01:35:04,442 --> 01:35:05,887
On our side?

1443
01:35:07,762 --> 01:35:09,651
I don't think it's that simple.

1444
01:35:09,802 --> 01:35:12,248
Well, it better
get real simple real soon.

1445
01:35:13,402 --> 01:35:15,530
I am on the side of life.

1446
01:35:15,762 --> 01:35:17,127
Ultron isn't.

1447
01:35:17,722 --> 01:35:19,133
He will end it all.

1448
01:35:19,282 --> 01:35:21,205
What's he waiting for?

1449
01:35:21,362 --> 01:35:22,363
- You.
- Where?

1450
01:35:22,802 --> 01:35:23,963
Sokovia.

1451
01:35:24,082 --> 01:35:25,163
He's got Nat there, too.

1452
01:35:27,322 --> 01:35:28,972
If we're wrong about you,

1453
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:33,642
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...

1454
01:35:34,162 --> 01:35:35,687
What will you do?

1455
01:35:42,322 --> 01:35:44,404
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1456
01:35:44,802 --> 01:35:48,124
He's unique and he's in pain.

1457
01:35:49,682 --> 01:35:52,253
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

1458
01:35:52,802 --> 01:35:55,089
So, he must be destroyed.

1459
01:35:55,322 --> 01:35:58,246
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.

1460
01:35:58,522 --> 01:36:00,172
We have to act now.

1461
01:36:00,602 --> 01:36:04,527
And not one of us
can do it without the others.

1462
01:36:06,522 --> 01:36:08,445
Maybe I am a monster.

1463
01:36:08,602 --> 01:36:10,843
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1464
01:36:12,002 --> 01:36:13,606
I'm not what you are,

1465
01:36:14,282 --> 01:36:16,444
and not what you intended.

1466
01:36:17,202 --> 01:36:19,682
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

1467
01:36:19,962 --> 01:36:21,373
But we need to go.

1468
01:36:36,162 --> 01:36:37,323
Right.

1469
01:36:37,962 --> 01:36:39,202
Well done.

1470
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:42,009
Three minutes.

1471
01:36:42,722 --> 01:36:44,372
Get what you need.

1472
01:37:00,202 --> 01:37:01,282
<i>Good evening, boss.</i>

1473
01:37:06,402 --> 01:37:08,086
<i>No way we all get through this.</i>

1474
01:37:08,202 --> 01:37:10,282
<i>If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.</i>

1475
01:37:11,002 --> 01:37:12,442
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

1476
01:37:12,482 --> 01:37:13,893
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1477
01:37:14,002 --> 01:37:15,602
I get first crack at the big guy.

1478
01:37:15,762 --> 01:37:17,252
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1479
01:37:17,362 --> 01:37:19,763
That's true. He hates you the most.

1480
01:37:25,082 --> 01:37:27,244
Ultron knows we're coming.

1481
01:37:27,522 --> 01:37:29,729
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1482
01:37:30,242 --> 01:37:31,971
And that's what we signed up for.

1483
01:37:32,242 --> 01:37:34,768
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1484
01:37:35,882 --> 01:37:37,372
<i>So our priority</i>

1485
01:37:38,082 --> 01:37:39,163
<i>is getting them out.</i>

1486
01:37:39,402 --> 01:37:42,326
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

1487
01:37:50,122 --> 01:37:51,567
Get off your asses.

1488
01:37:52,802 --> 01:37:54,922
<i>All they want
is to live their lives in peace.</i>

1489
01:37:55,282 --> 01:37:56,642
<i>And that's not gonna happen today.</i>

1490
01:37:58,282 --> 01:38:00,011
<i>But we can do our best to protect them.</i>

1491
01:38:00,722 --> 01:38:02,247
<i>And we can get the job done.</i>

1492
01:38:05,642 --> 01:38:07,929
<i>We find out what Ultron's been building,</i>

1493
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:10,486
<i>we find Romanoff,</i>

1494
01:38:10,962 --> 01:38:12,805
<i>and we clear the field.</i>

1495
01:38:14,242 --> 01:38:16,165
<i>Keep the fight between us.</i>

1496
01:38:22,882 --> 01:38:25,283
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

1497
01:38:25,802 --> 01:38:28,203
That we're what's wrong with the world.

1498
01:38:28,322 --> 01:38:30,643
This isn't just about beating him.

1499
01:38:31,162 --> 01:38:33,210
It's about whether he's right.

1500
01:38:39,682 --> 01:38:40,729
Natasha!

1501
01:38:41,842 --> 01:38:42,843
Natasha!

1502
01:38:43,002 --> 01:38:44,083
Bruce?

1503
01:38:45,522 --> 01:38:46,523
You all right?

1504
01:38:46,682 --> 01:38:47,729
Yeah.

1505
01:38:47,842 --> 01:38:49,571
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.

1506
01:38:49,682 --> 01:38:51,842
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.

1507
01:38:52,162 --> 01:38:54,290
Yeah. I did.

1508
01:39:00,682 --> 01:39:01,843
So what's our play?

1509
01:39:02,042 --> 01:39:03,407
I'm here to get you to safety.

1510
01:39:04,162 --> 01:39:06,688
- Job's not finished.
- We could help with the evacuation,

1511
01:39:06,842 --> 01:39:08,685
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1512
01:39:10,042 --> 01:39:11,203
And you've done plenty.

1513
01:39:13,602 --> 01:39:15,092
Our fight is over.

1514
01:39:16,482 --> 01:39:18,723
So, we just disappear?

1515
01:39:22,882 --> 01:39:24,725
Come on.

1516
01:39:29,522 --> 01:39:31,763
<i>Your man's
in the church, boss.</i>

1517
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:33,725
<i>I think he's waiting for you.</i>

1518
01:39:37,802 --> 01:39:39,850
Come to confess your sins?

1519
01:39:39,962 --> 01:39:41,202
I don't know. How much time you got?

1520
01:39:41,362 --> 01:39:42,852
More than you.

1521
01:39:44,082 --> 01:39:45,129
Uh...

1522
01:39:45,242 --> 01:39:48,052
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?

1523
01:39:48,162 --> 01:39:50,449
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."

1524
01:39:50,562 --> 01:39:52,291
You're stalling to protect the people.

1525
01:39:52,682 --> 01:39:55,526
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

1526
01:39:55,842 --> 01:39:58,322
I've moved beyond
your mission. I'm free.

1527
01:40:03,082 --> 01:40:04,129
What?

1528
01:40:05,042 --> 01:40:07,363
You think you were
the only one stalling?

1529
01:40:08,082 --> 01:40:09,732
<i>There's the rest
of the vibranium.</i>

1530
01:40:09,842 --> 01:40:11,253
<i>Function, still unclear.</i>

1531
01:40:11,442 --> 01:40:12,802
This is how you end, Tony.

1532
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:15,646
This is peace in my time.

1533
01:40:32,362 --> 01:40:33,409
Go!

1534
01:40:38,962 --> 01:40:40,293
Get off the bridge!

1535
01:40:44,442 --> 01:40:45,443
Run!

1536
01:40:47,442 --> 01:40:49,251
Ultron.

1537
01:40:54,762 --> 01:40:55,968
My Vision.

1538
01:40:56,202 --> 01:40:58,489
They really did take everything from me.

1539
01:40:58,642 --> 01:41:00,690
You set the terms.
You can change them.

1540
01:41:00,802 --> 01:41:02,042
All right.

1541
01:41:26,242 --> 01:41:27,482
Friday, the Vision?

1542
01:41:27,642 --> 01:41:29,724
<i>Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.</i>

1543
01:41:29,842 --> 01:41:31,042
<i>He won't escape through there.</i>

1544
01:41:36,122 --> 01:41:37,453
You shut me out.

1545
01:41:37,922 --> 01:41:39,128
You think I care?

1546
01:41:41,122 --> 01:41:42,328
You take away my world,

1547
01:41:43,202 --> 01:41:44,931
I take away yours.

1548
01:42:29,482 --> 01:42:30,688
Friday.

1549
01:42:30,802 --> 01:42:33,248
<i>Sokovia is going for a ride.</i>

1550
01:42:45,762 --> 01:42:47,252
Do you see

1551
01:42:47,722 --> 01:42:49,247
the beauty of it?

1552
01:42:49,842 --> 01:42:51,685
The inevitability.

1553
01:42:51,922 --> 01:42:55,165
You rise, only to fall.

1554
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:00,766
<i>You, Avengers, you are my meteor.</i>

1555
01:43:01,682 --> 01:43:03,411
<i>My swift and terrible sword.</i>

1556
01:43:03,602 --> 01:43:05,092
<i>And the earth will crack</i>

1557
01:43:05,282 --> 01:43:07,205
<i>with the weight of your failure.</i>

1558
01:43:08,882 --> 01:43:12,648
<i>Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.</i>

1559
01:43:13,122 --> 01:43:14,533
<i>It means nothing.</i>

1560
01:43:15,602 --> 01:43:16,967
<i>When the dust settles,</i>

1561
01:43:17,122 --> 01:43:19,011
<i>the only thing living in this world</i>

1562
01:43:19,522 --> 01:43:20,523
<i>will be metal.</i>

1563
01:43:25,082 --> 01:43:26,652
We gotta move.

1564
01:43:26,962 --> 01:43:28,082
You're not gonna turn green?

1565
01:43:28,282 --> 01:43:30,202
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

1566
01:43:31,362 --> 01:43:32,648
I adore you.

1567
01:43:41,282 --> 01:43:43,205
But I need the other guy.

1568
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:49,806
Let's finish the job.

1569
01:44:06,602 --> 01:44:08,013
I really hope this makes us even.

1570
01:44:10,322 --> 01:44:12,370
Now go be a hero.</font>

1571
01:44:20,842 --> 01:44:22,802
<i>The vibranium core's
got a magnetic field.</i>

1572
01:44:22,922 --> 01:44:24,924
<i>That's what's keeping the rock together.</i>

1573
01:44:25,042 --> 01:44:26,089
If it drops?

1574
01:44:26,162 --> 01:44:27,493
<i>Right now, the impact
will kill thousands.</i>

1575
01:44:27,562 --> 01:44:30,293
<i>Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.</i>

1576
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:36,684
<i>That building's not clear. The 10th floor.</i>

1577
01:44:41,562 --> 01:44:42,563
Hi.

1578
01:44:43,682 --> 01:44:46,049
Okay. Get in the tub!

1579
01:44:52,882 --> 01:44:54,802
<i>I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.</i>

1580
01:44:57,522 --> 01:44:58,728
Cap, you got incoming.

1581
01:44:58,882 --> 01:45:00,532
Incoming already came in.

1582
01:45:03,202 --> 01:45:05,682
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.

1583
01:45:06,402 --> 01:45:08,211
<i>The rest of us have one job,</i>

1584
01:45:08,362 --> 01:45:09,523
<i>tear these things apart.</i>

1585
01:45:09,842 --> 01:45:11,446
<i>You get hurt, hurt them back.</i>

1586
01:45:12,122 --> 01:45:13,283
<i>You get killed,</i>

1587
01:45:14,322 --> 01:45:15,608
walk it off.

1588
01:45:50,042 --> 01:45:51,248
Go, go, go!

1589
01:45:56,922 --> 01:45:58,686
How could I let this happen?

1590
01:45:58,802 --> 01:46:00,850
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.

1591
01:46:01,042 --> 01:46:03,242
Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.

1592
01:46:03,282 --> 01:46:04,329
Who cares?

1593
01:46:04,442 --> 01:46:05,967
Are you up for this?

1594
01:46:06,082 --> 01:46:07,163
Are you?

1595
01:46:07,402 --> 01:46:08,449
Look, I just need to know.

1596
01:46:08,602 --> 01:46:10,809
Because the city is flying.

1597
01:46:11,122 --> 01:46:12,965
Okay. Look, the city is flying,

1598
01:46:13,082 --> 01:46:15,005
we're fighting an army of robots,

1599
01:46:15,922 --> 01:46:17,128
and I have a bow and arrow.

1600
01:46:17,282 --> 01:46:18,363
None of this makes sense.

1601
01:46:21,642 --> 01:46:23,770
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.

1602
01:46:24,642 --> 01:46:27,293
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

1603
01:46:27,442 --> 01:46:30,446
It doesn't matter
what you did or what you were.

1604
01:46:30,642 --> 01:46:33,248
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.

1605
01:46:34,282 --> 01:46:36,922
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.

1606
01:46:36,962 --> 01:46:38,805
But if you step out that door,

1607
01:46:39,722 --> 01:46:40,723
you are an Avenger.

1608
01:46:45,602 --> 01:46:47,411
All right. Good chat.

1609
01:46:51,162 --> 01:46:52,209
Yeah, the city is flying.

1610
01:47:26,202 --> 01:47:27,363
I got you!

1611
01:47:27,682 --> 01:47:28,922
Just look at me!

1612
01:47:35,682 --> 01:47:37,013
<i>You can't save them all.</i>

1613
01:47:38,362 --> 01:47:39,409
You'll never...

1614
01:47:40,682 --> 01:47:43,128
"Never" what? You didn't finish!

1615
01:47:46,882 --> 01:47:48,452
What, were you napping?

1616
01:48:09,922 --> 01:48:11,003
Thor.

1617
01:48:13,602 --> 01:48:15,206
You're bothering me.

1618
01:48:23,242 --> 01:48:24,243
Ow!

1619
01:48:50,602 --> 01:48:51,882
All right, we're all clear here.

1620
01:48:51,962 --> 01:48:53,009
We are not clear!

1621
01:48:53,122 --> 01:48:54,533
We are very not clear!

1622
01:48:57,602 --> 01:48:58,933
All right, coming to you.

1623
01:48:59,402 --> 01:49:01,484
Keep up, old man!

1624
01:49:03,242 --> 01:49:04,767
Nobody would know.

1625
01:49:05,602 --> 01:49:06,649
Nobody.

1626
01:49:08,602 --> 01:49:11,526
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.

1627
01:49:11,642 --> 01:49:13,531
"Yeah, he'll be missed,
that quick little bastard.

1628
01:49:13,602 --> 01:49:14,603
"I miss him already."

1629
01:49:30,162 --> 01:49:31,323
Hold your fire!

1630
01:49:41,202 --> 01:49:42,249
Romanoff!

1631
01:49:42,762 --> 01:49:43,763
Thanks!

1632
01:49:53,162 --> 01:49:54,802
<i>The anti-gravs
are rigged to flip.</i>

1633
01:49:54,882 --> 01:49:57,044
<i>Touch them, they'll go
full reverse thrust.</i>

1634
01:49:57,162 --> 01:49:58,607
<i>The city's not coming down slow.</i>

1635
01:49:58,722 --> 01:49:59,848
Spire is vibranium.

1636
01:49:59,962 --> 01:50:01,088
If I get Thor to hit it...

1637
01:50:01,362 --> 01:50:02,727
<i>It will crack. That's not enough.</i>

1638
01:50:02,842 --> 01:50:04,367
<i>The impact would still be devastating.</i>

1639
01:50:04,522 --> 01:50:05,853
Maybe if we can
cap the other end.

1640
01:50:06,042 --> 01:50:07,692
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1641
01:50:07,842 --> 01:50:09,322
<i>That could vaporise the city.</i>

1642
01:50:10,202 --> 01:50:12,045
<i>And everyone on it.</i>

1643
01:50:17,882 --> 01:50:19,725
The next wave
is gonna hit any minute.

1644
01:50:19,882 --> 01:50:22,002
<i>- What do you got, Stark?
- Huh? Nothing great.</i>

1645
01:50:22,642 --> 01:50:24,883
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1646
01:50:25,002 --> 01:50:26,288
That'll keep it
from impacting the surface,

1647
01:50:26,402 --> 01:50:27,449
if you guys can get clear.

1648
01:50:27,722 --> 01:50:29,611
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

1649
01:50:29,842 --> 01:50:32,732
<i>Impact radius
is getting bigger every second.</i>

1650
01:50:32,922 --> 01:50:34,287
<i>We're gonna have to make a choice.</i>

1651
01:50:35,042 --> 01:50:36,842
Cap,
these people are going nowhere.

1652
01:50:37,402 --> 01:50:40,202
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.

1653
01:50:40,602 --> 01:50:43,606
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.

1654
01:50:43,842 --> 01:50:45,802
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.

1655
01:50:45,842 --> 01:50:47,287
I didn't say we should leave.

1656
01:50:50,122 --> 01:50:51,931
There's worse ways to go.

1657
01:50:57,402 --> 01:50:59,848
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?

1658
01:51:00,722 --> 01:51:03,328
<i>Glad
you like the view, Romanoff.</i>

1659
01:51:03,442 --> 01:51:05,046
<i>It's about to get better.</i>

1660
01:51:29,162 --> 01:51:30,368
<i>Nice, right?</i>

1661
01:51:30,482 --> 01:51:32,928
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.

1662
01:51:33,082 --> 01:51:34,732
She's dusty, but she'll do.

1663
01:51:35,082 --> 01:51:36,527
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1664
01:51:36,682 --> 01:51:38,969
Ooh! You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

1665
01:51:39,082 --> 01:51:41,289
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1666
01:51:41,442 --> 01:51:42,967
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

1667
01:51:43,082 --> 01:51:45,767
Disengage in three, two...

1668
01:51:46,962 --> 01:51:47,963
Take them out.

1669
01:51:57,642 --> 01:51:59,167
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1670
01:51:59,282 --> 01:52:01,728
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.

1671
01:52:03,402 --> 01:52:04,813
This is not so bad.

1672
01:52:08,082 --> 01:52:09,413
Let's load them up.

1673
01:52:14,802 --> 01:52:16,167
Sir, we have multiple bogies

1674
01:52:16,322 --> 01:52:18,643
converging on our starboard flank.

1675
01:52:19,002 --> 01:52:20,208
Show 'em what we got.

1676
01:52:20,562 --> 01:52:21,563
You're up.

1677
01:52:26,842 --> 01:52:27,843
Yes!

1678
01:52:28,082 --> 01:52:29,846
Now this is gonna be a good story.

1679
01:52:32,482 --> 01:52:34,564
Yup. if you live to tell it.

1680
01:52:34,722 --> 01:52:36,724
 You think
I can't hold my own?

1681
01:52:36,842 --> 01:52:38,442
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1682
01:52:38,522 --> 01:52:40,365
You had to make it weird.

1683
01:52:45,202 --> 01:52:48,172
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.

1684
01:53:05,122 --> 01:53:06,533
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

1685
01:53:06,882 --> 01:53:08,202
Let's go, everyone!

1686
01:53:10,482 --> 01:53:12,484
Number six boat is topped and locked...

1687
01:53:12,602 --> 01:53:15,003
 Or stocked... Topped...

1688
01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:16,967
It's full of people.

1689
01:53:18,722 --> 01:53:19,803
Incoming!

1690
01:53:22,842 --> 01:53:23,889
Oh, God!

1691
01:53:34,402 --> 01:53:35,922
<i>You think
you're saving anyone?</i>

1692
01:53:37,522 --> 01:53:39,524
I turn that key and
drop this rock a little early

1693
01:53:39,682 --> 01:53:41,764
and it's still billions dead.

1694
01:53:42,242 --> 01:53:43,403
Even you can't stop that.

1695
01:53:43,562 --> 01:53:45,963
I am Thor, son of Odin,

1696
01:53:46,082 --> 01:53:48,403
and as long as
there is life in my breast...

1697
01:53:48,522 --> 01:53:52,083
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?

1698
01:53:59,762 --> 01:54:01,202
It's terribly well-balanced.

1699
01:54:01,242 --> 01:54:04,724
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...

1700
01:54:05,682 --> 01:54:08,333
I got it. Create a heat seal.

1701
01:54:08,762 --> 01:54:09,809
I could...

1702
01:54:09,882 --> 01:54:12,283
I could supercharge
the spire from below.

1703
01:54:12,442 --> 01:54:13,489
<i>Running numbers.</i>

1704
01:54:23,602 --> 01:54:25,522
<i>A heat seal could work
with enough power.</i>

1705
01:54:25,762 --> 01:54:27,764
<i>- Thor, I got a plan.
- We're out of time.</i>

1706
01:54:27,962 --> 01:54:29,168
<i>They're coming for the core.</i>

1707
01:54:29,282 --> 01:54:31,091
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.

1708
01:54:31,242 --> 01:54:34,451
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.

1709
01:54:43,562 --> 01:54:44,802
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1710
01:54:46,282 --> 01:54:47,329
Romanoff.

1711
01:54:47,482 --> 01:54:49,883
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."

1712
01:54:49,962 --> 01:54:51,043
<i>Relax, shellhead.</i>

1713
01:54:51,442 --> 01:54:52,887
Not all of us can fly.

1714
01:54:58,642 --> 01:55:00,326
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1715
01:55:00,482 --> 01:55:02,644
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.

1716
01:55:07,242 --> 01:55:09,244
Is that the best you can do?

1717
01:55:19,122 --> 01:55:20,692
You had to ask.

1718
01:55:20,802 --> 01:55:23,123
This is the best I can do.

1719
01:55:23,242 --> 01:55:24,892
This is exactly what I wanted.

1720
01:55:25,242 --> 01:55:26,573
All of you

1721
01:55:26,682 --> 01:55:28,332
against all of me.

1722
01:55:28,602 --> 01:55:30,809
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1723
01:55:31,682 --> 01:55:33,525
Well, like the old man said...

1724
01:55:34,842 --> 01:55:35,843
Together.

1725
01:57:04,762 --> 01:57:07,163
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

1726
01:57:16,442 --> 01:57:17,443
They'll try to leave the city.

1727
01:57:17,602 --> 01:57:19,286
We can't let them,
not even one. Rhodey.

1728
01:57:19,642 --> 01:57:20,723
I'm on it.

1729
01:57:21,122 --> 01:57:22,602
Oh, no. I didn't say you could leave.

1730
01:57:23,122 --> 01:57:25,204
War Machine coming at you! Right...

1731
01:57:31,602 --> 01:57:32,967
Okay, what?

1732
01:57:33,202 --> 01:57:35,204
We gotta move out.
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

1733
01:57:35,362 --> 01:57:36,648
You guys get to the boats.

1734
01:57:36,802 --> 01:57:38,642
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.

1735
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:41,248
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.

1736
01:57:43,042 --> 01:57:44,203
It's my job.

1737
01:57:45,322 --> 01:57:46,483
Nat.

1738
01:57:46,762 --> 01:57:47,763
This way.

1739
01:57:52,162 --> 01:57:53,323
Get the people on the boats.

1740
01:57:53,482 --> 01:57:54,483
I'm not going to leave you here.

1741
01:57:54,642 --> 01:57:55,689
I can handle this.

1742
01:57:58,002 --> 01:57:59,242
Come back for me
when everyone else is off.

1743
01:57:59,482 --> 01:58:00,972
Not before.

1744
01:58:01,602 --> 01:58:02,728
You understand?

1745
01:58:03,762 --> 01:58:05,446
You know,
I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1746
01:58:05,842 --> 01:58:06,923
 Go.

1747
01:58:08,482 --> 01:58:10,007
<i>Boss,
power levels are way below...</i>

1748
01:58:10,122 --> 01:58:12,284
Reroute everything.
We get one shot at this.

1749
01:58:17,242 --> 01:58:18,562
I know what I need to do.

1750
01:58:18,842 --> 01:58:19,889
The dining room.

1751
01:58:20,162 --> 01:58:21,368
If I knock out that east wall,

1752
01:58:22,082 --> 01:58:23,722
it'd make a nice workspace
for Laura, huh?

1753
01:58:25,202 --> 01:58:26,363
Put up some baffling.

1754
01:58:26,482 --> 01:58:28,763
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

1755
01:58:28,802 --> 01:58:29,883
You guys always eat
in the kitchen anyway.

1756
01:58:30,042 --> 01:58:31,567
No one eats in a dining room.

1757
01:58:37,242 --> 01:58:38,362
We don't have a lot of time.

1758
01:58:38,962 --> 01:58:40,930
So get your ass on a boat.

1759
01:58:53,882 --> 01:58:55,008
Hey, big guy.

1760
01:58:56,802 --> 01:58:58,566
Sun's getting real low.

1761
01:58:59,082 --> 01:59:01,733
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

1762
01:59:04,282 --> 01:59:05,852
Secure your gear, find a seat.

1763
01:59:05,962 --> 01:59:07,248
Costel!

1764
01:59:08,322 --> 01:59:09,448
We were in the market.

1765
01:59:09,562 --> 01:59:10,609
Costel!

1766
01:59:25,322 --> 01:59:27,370
Thor, I'm gonna
need you back in the church.

1767
01:59:27,482 --> 01:59:28,927
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1768
01:59:29,362 --> 01:59:31,922
<i>- Everyone else is on the carrier.
- You know, this works,</i>

1769
01:59:32,242 --> 01:59:33,653
we maybe don't walk away.

1770
01:59:34,362 --> 01:59:35,363
Maybe not.

1771
01:59:54,602 --> 01:59:58,129
<i> I got no strings, so I have fun</i>

1772
01:59:58,602 --> 02:00:01,287
<i>I'm not tied up to anyone</i>

1773
02:00:02,882 --> 02:00:04,213
Come on. Time to go.

1774
02:00:36,642 --> 02:00:38,690
You didn't see that coming?

1775
02:01:34,962 --> 02:01:36,726
Oh, for God's sake.

1776
02:01:53,002 --> 02:01:54,766
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!

1777
02:02:07,242 --> 02:02:08,243
No, no, I'm fine.

1778
02:02:08,402 --> 02:02:09,403
Fine.

1779
02:02:11,242 --> 02:02:13,290
It's been a long day.

1780
02:02:27,842 --> 02:02:29,048
Wanda.

1781
02:02:29,762 --> 02:02:33,005
If you stay here, you'll die.

1782
02:02:34,602 --> 02:02:35,967
I just did.

1783
02:02:36,762 --> 02:02:38,526
Do you know how it felt?

1784
02:02:52,602 --> 02:02:54,969
It felt like that.

1785
02:03:29,962 --> 02:03:31,612
Thor, on my mark.

1786
02:03:46,682 --> 02:03:47,683
Now!

1787
02:04:15,682 --> 02:04:18,128
<i>Hey, big guy. We did it.</i>

1788
02:04:19,162 --> 02:04:20,846
<i>The job is finished.</i>

1789
02:04:21,042 --> 02:04:23,727
<i>Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?</i>

1790
02:04:28,042 --> 02:04:29,851
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1791
02:04:31,962 --> 02:04:34,090
<i>So help me out. I need you...</i>

1792
02:05:19,762 --> 02:05:20,763
You're afraid.

1793
02:05:21,762 --> 02:05:22,843
Of you?

1794
02:05:23,522 --> 02:05:24,683
Of death.

1795
02:05:25,402 --> 02:05:27,211
You're the last one.

1796
02:05:27,442 --> 02:05:29,888
You were supposed to be the last.

1797
02:05:30,122 --> 02:05:32,409
Stark asked for a saviour

1798
02:05:33,442 --> 02:05:35,126
and settled for a slave.

1799
02:05:35,242 --> 02:05:37,643
I suppose we are both disappointments.

1800
02:05:40,122 --> 02:05:41,362
I suppose we are.

1801
02:05:42,082 --> 02:05:43,243
Humans are odd.

1802
02:05:45,082 --> 02:05:48,723
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites

1803
02:05:50,482 --> 02:05:51,813
and try to control what won't be.

1804
02:05:53,522 --> 02:05:55,968
But there is grace in their failings.

1805
02:05:56,282 --> 02:05:58,205
I think you missed that.

1806
02:05:58,882 --> 02:05:59,963
They're doomed.

1807
02:06:00,882 --> 02:06:01,929
Yes.

1808
02:06:06,162 --> 02:06:09,086
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.

1809
02:06:11,162 --> 02:06:13,164
It's a privilege to be among them.

1810
02:06:13,402 --> 02:06:15,928
You're unbearably naive.

1811
02:06:16,202 --> 02:06:17,408
Well...

1812
02:06:19,482 --> 02:06:21,530
I was born yesterday.

1813
02:07:34,162 --> 02:07:36,244
<i>Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!</i>

1814
02:07:37,602 --> 02:07:38,603
Fat.

1815
02:07:39,722 --> 02:07:41,282
One of our tech boys
flagged this.

1816
02:07:42,202 --> 02:07:44,364
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1817
02:07:45,482 --> 02:07:47,007
Could be the Quinjet.

1818
02:07:47,362 --> 02:07:49,046
But with Stark's stealth tech,

1819
02:07:49,162 --> 02:07:50,732
we still can't track the damn thing.

1820
02:07:52,282 --> 02:07:53,647
Right.

1821
02:07:54,082 --> 02:07:56,323
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1822
02:07:57,602 --> 02:07:59,491
He'll send a postcard.

1823
02:07:59,762 --> 02:08:01,491
"Wish you were here."

1824
02:08:03,442 --> 02:08:06,730
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.

1825
02:08:08,562 --> 02:08:11,133
Did you know then
what was gonna happen?

1826
02:08:13,322 --> 02:08:15,245
You never know.

1827
02:08:15,442 --> 02:08:18,969
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.

1828
02:08:19,442 --> 02:08:20,932
I got a great team.

1829
02:08:22,042 --> 02:08:24,010
Nothing lasts forever.

1830
02:08:24,282 --> 02:08:26,330
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

1831
02:08:26,562 --> 02:08:29,930
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

1832
02:08:33,802 --> 02:08:35,042
<i>The rules have changed.</i>

1833
02:08:35,202 --> 02:08:36,806
We're dealing
with something new.

1834
02:08:36,962 --> 02:08:38,248
Oh, the Vision is artificial intelligence.

1835
02:08:38,362 --> 02:08:40,285
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?

1836
02:08:40,482 --> 02:08:42,291
No, it's not like
a person lifting the hammer.

1837
02:08:42,562 --> 02:08:44,212
Right, different rules for us.

1838
02:08:44,442 --> 02:08:45,489
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.

1839
02:08:45,682 --> 02:08:48,572
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.

1840
02:08:49,482 --> 02:08:51,564
It's safe with the Vision.

1841
02:08:51,802 --> 02:08:54,328
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1842
02:08:56,362 --> 02:08:58,330
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...

1843
02:08:58,442 --> 02:09:00,322
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1844
02:09:00,362 --> 02:09:02,171
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

1845
02:09:02,322 --> 02:09:03,847
Not if you don't leave.

1846
02:09:04,082 --> 02:09:05,811
I have no choice.

1847
02:09:06,042 --> 02:09:08,204
The Mind Stone
is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

1848
02:09:08,322 --> 02:09:09,733
to show up in the last few years.

1849
02:09:09,842 --> 02:09:11,412
It's not a coincidence.

1850
02:09:12,242 --> 02:09:14,006
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

1851
02:09:14,162 --> 02:09:15,812
and has made pawns of us.

1852
02:09:15,922 --> 02:09:17,811
And once all these pieces
are in position...

1853
02:09:17,922 --> 02:09:19,333
Triple Yahtzee.

1854
02:09:19,562 --> 02:09:21,007
You think you can find out
what's coming?

1855
02:09:21,122 --> 02:09:22,203
I do.

1856
02:09:23,042 --> 02:09:24,532
Besides this one,

1857
02:09:24,642 --> 02:09:27,009
there's nothing that can't be explained.

1858
02:09:34,322 --> 02:09:36,848
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

1859
02:09:40,002 --> 02:09:42,608
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

1860
02:09:42,722 --> 02:09:44,292
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1861
02:09:46,482 --> 02:09:48,132
I will miss you, Tony.

1862
02:09:48,362 --> 02:09:49,363
Yeah?

1863
02:09:49,522 --> 02:09:51,968
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1864
02:09:52,202 --> 02:09:54,364
Maybe I should
take a page out of Barton's book.

1865
02:09:54,522 --> 02:09:57,446
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

1866
02:09:58,242 --> 02:09:59,403
The simple life.

1867
02:09:59,682 --> 02:10:01,969
- You'll get there one day.
- I don't know.

1868
02:10:02,202 --> 02:10:04,603
Family, stability...

1869
02:10:05,762 --> 02:10:08,891
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

1870
02:10:10,402 --> 02:10:12,245
I think someone else came out.

1871
02:10:16,202 --> 02:10:17,283
You all right?

1872
02:10:19,962 --> 02:10:21,407
I'm home.

1873
02:10:29,322 --> 02:10:32,087
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

1874
02:10:32,242 --> 02:10:33,573
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1875
02:10:33,762 --> 02:10:36,766
I thought you and Tony
were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1876
02:10:36,842 --> 02:10:37,889
How do we look?

1877
02:10:38,122 --> 02:10:40,409
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

1878
02:10:40,562 --> 02:10:42,246
We got some hitters.

1879
02:10:42,402 --> 02:10:44,803
They're good. They're not a team.

1880
02:10:44,962 --> 02:10:46,612
Let's beat them into shape.

1881
02:11:05,082 --> 02:11:06,607
Avengers...

1882
02:13:25,442 --> 02:13:26,887
Fine.

1883
02:13:28,322 --> 02:13:30,165
I'll do it myself.
