1
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,600
What's wrong?

2
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,660
They're foolish.

3
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,730
I just need to be prepared.

4
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,090
Must be buried elsewhere.

5
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,750
elsewhere.

6
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,870
Like what?

7
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm gonna love her
more play to help with me.

8
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:18,900
Yeah!

9
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,260
Science!

10
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,820
I'm gonna leave you here.

11
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,480
Enter Kamala Khan.

12
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,180
It's ready for... I'm gonna
leave you here with my house.

13
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Shina!

14
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm gonna leave you here with me.

15
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:48,070
Christ, I'm just in here.

16
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,146
Because he may have enders me back up here.

17
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:53,770
I am!

18
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,070
Come back!

19
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,930
This is my chance.

20
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,650
Now that kid, what's your name?

21
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,950
The Marvel Dude.

22
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,970
Tomlinsi.

23
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,850
Hey, you wanna go party with your vendors?

24
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,650
Uh, yeah.

25
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,990
Uh, can you fly?

26
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,950
No, but I can do this.

27
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,610
Ta-da!

28
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,730
I'm gonna leave you here.

29
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,830
Okay.

30
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,170
You don't remember anything.

31
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,670
I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

32
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:04,671
Flashes.

33
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,770
Little moments.

34
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,450
If I could just piece together what happens
in the morning, maybe it all makes me see.

35
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,330
You stole me, from my home, my family, my
friend, because I've been dead in trouble.

36
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,150
I have for the faster, baby, just me.

37
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,490
Tell us if you're from intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

38
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,790
The war, the lies, all of it.

39
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,350
You can't do this.

40
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,930
I'll be back before you know it.

41
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,310
I can fly up and meet you that way.

42
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,590
I only feel it on the globe like
you're not to care about me.

43
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,880
Incoming cold, for me, fear it.

44
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,220
Oh, you expecting a call?

45
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,780
Maybe we just send it to voicemail.

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He's next fury.

47
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,280
My favorite one I've made of entry.

48
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,080
They don't stand for us,
prodigal child of the Milky Way.

49
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,860
I'll go with it out there.

50
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:44,555
What the hell was that?

51
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,560
No?

52
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Yeah.

53
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,480
What's up?

54
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,260
What about you?

55
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
How are you doing?

56
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,320
What do you know about the
surge in the jump point system?

57
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,580
Did you all have to go?

58
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,240
I didn't notice anything
unusual to go in now.

59
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,040
How about the whole system?

60
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,076
We're trying to get a
handle on what happened.

61
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,380
The entire network was affected?

62
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,580
Yeah, end to end.

63
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,953
Thankfully, our neural
network team was able

64
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:09,080
to trace the origin
back to MD for a team.

65
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,980
You're in the neighborhood, right?

66
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:11,981
Yeah.

67
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Are you checking out?

68
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,920
I want it.

69
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Appreciate you.

70
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,091
Monica, our team looks in
more and tells us they're acquired.

71
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Monica?

72
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,180
What's she doing there?

73
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,660
I thought that she was on Earth.

74
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,180
Is she okay?

75
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Yeah.

76
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,550
She's not that little kid you remember.

77
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,790
So, don't we think that we
can finish this before dinner?

78
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,791
Oh, my God.

79
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,750
What if it's in time to get
the reading of the jump point?

80
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,650
Oh, I'm doing so much superpowers and cool.

81
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,050
Oh.

82
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,710
I'm fine.

83
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,670
I'm low.

84
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,890
You guys had energy steps up the network.

85
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,990
I gotta find this damage
and see if we can reverse it.

86
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,710
Well, I got that.

87
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Communications override.

88
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,580
Captain Ramville, Space Wolf.

89
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Captain.

90
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,740
Ramville.

91
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,300
What the hell are you doing?

92
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,020
Seems the surge has had some
residual effect on the jump point.

93
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm going to get you
some readings, Fearing.

94
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,900
Hello?

95
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,000
My car.

96
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Hello?

97
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Is that Monica?

98
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
My Carol?

99
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:07,760
Fearing?

100
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,260
Was that Monica?

101
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:08,860
Why?

102
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,880
You want to talk to her?

103
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,100
I don't think I'm in the best...

104
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,661
I don't... I don't want...
I don't want... Look.

105
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,616
I don't want to talk to her like this.

106
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Not after all this time.

107
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,220
You know, eventually you're
going to have to talk to her.

108
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:23,820
I know.

109
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,300
I know.

110
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,300
But say the family reunion
is still on back inside.

111
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,670
I think I found the source of the surge.

112
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,350
What do you see?

113
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,950
It's a jump point, but
it's not closing like...

114
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,490
It's stuck.

115
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,190
Dabbers.

116
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,170
Dabbers.

117
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,330
Dabbers.

118
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:14,140
Jump point is still thinking energy.

119
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Hello?

120
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
Hello?

121
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,750
Hello?

122
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,030
Hello?

123
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,680
How did you go?

124
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:59,090
How did you go?

125
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,451
Um... Hi.

126
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,010
How's my good living room?

127
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,011
Hello?

128
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,930
Hello?

129
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,470
What is Dabbers doing?

130
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,750
It's too late.

131
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,530
As you find us already on Tommy.

132
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,290
You can't stop this.

133
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,540
Fury, it's the Cree.

134
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,080
They're going after this
rolled onto our necks.

135
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,760
Hold on.

136
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,580
Do not go in swinging this
little piece and reconciliation tool.

137
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Fury, I got this.

138
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,720
So I switched with someone
named Kamala Khan?

139
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,060
Yeah.

140
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,940
She seemed to be as confused as you are.

141
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,460
There's nothing in her
power set about teleportation.

142
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,280
Not about her.

143
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,960
I don't know what happened
to you in me for a while.

144
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Yes, sir.

145
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,280
Uh... I'm not afraid of this.

146
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,640
I'm not really sure.

147
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,440
Oh, I did not break my closet door.

148
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Okay, I've seen space.

149
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,360
Oh, I should have broke it, sir.

150
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,460
Oh, no, no, no, no.

151
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,840
See, I disappeared.

152
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,520
So maybe Captain Marvel broke it?

153
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,140
What?

154
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Yes.

155
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,840
Your friend, Captain Marvel,

156
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,980
she's walking up and down our living room.

157
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
And now you come back,

158
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,760
well, sing in with no apologies.

159
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,000
Is there Captain Marvel's in her house?

160
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,060
It's Captain Marvel
pressuring you in any way.

161
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,220
Look, I understand that she's
an important figure and all that,

162
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,840
but you don't have to do it.

163
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,300
No, no, they're clearly working together.

164
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,180
Look at her face and her smile.

165
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,340
She's being super secret.

166
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,380
Always not just looking at her.

167
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,820
Mother, you're lying again?

168
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
You can tell me.

169
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,996
My daughter has said
she's not going to leave her.

170
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,320
She's having so much fun.

171
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,820
Look at this happening!

172
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,950
This is not what we agreed.

173
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:35,450
See, pram, madame.

174
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,730
The scroll has been scattered
to every corner of the universe.

175
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,350
Made refugees wherever we go.

176
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,850
And still, we came into these
negotiations in good faith.

177
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,550
I hate it.

178
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,430
I perhaps more than anyone understand
what you and your people have been through.

179
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,450
After my predecessor was destroyed,

180
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,190
heretics Rose up to filth Lloyd.

181
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:05,430
The civil war has polluted our skies.

182
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,810
My people cannot breathe.

183
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,990
Our son is dying.

184
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,510
Howler is out of time.

185
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,791
I hope we can rebuild
together so much so that I'm

186
00:15:17,803 --> 00:15:20,550
willing to put our ancient
animosities behind us.

187
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,550
and give you a chance
to protect your people.

188
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,370
To stop running.

189
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,860
The scroll will take their rightful
place in the Korean Empire.

190
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,420
And I will aid in a relocation.

191
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:48,025
I would hate for your people to
suffocate when I strip the atmosphere.

192
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,470
Let's see another island!

193
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,920
My son's on some freaky
spaceship and then I teleported here.

194
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,060
I don't know if that's my new powers,
but then that freaky cat ain't a man.

195
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,960
I don't know if that's gonna go wrong.

196
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,720
It goes come all the way out of the tent.

197
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,520
Oh, no, no, no, no.

198
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Please rush.

199
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,270
I have to get here and
how are you involved in this?

200
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,810
The Cree jury rigged a wormhole on a 418.

201
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,810
Give me like a jump one.

202
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,930
I don't know, but I touched it.

203
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,330
Why'd you do that?

204
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,031
Because I was glowing a mysterious.

205
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,170
Okay, no rule.

206
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,030
No, I'm touching shit.

207
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,870
Especially glowing mysterious shit.

208
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,166
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of negative
energy for me and I don't like it.

209
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:27,670
That's not the point.

210
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:31,830
The point is, is that it was siphoning
off the atmosphere and it did this.

211
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,150
This is me painting.

212
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:33,570
Cury!

213
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,870
There was like energy
that went around my hand.

214
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,110
Focus!

215
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,955
Okay, maybe if I do this.

216
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,630
I don't like that anymore.

217
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,850
I don't like it no more than that.

218
00:17:59,851 --> 00:17:59,950
I've got loads of creativity.

219
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,226
I wanted a modified puppets.

220
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,250
I wanna make it point.

221
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,850
Y'all can't do that whole,
doesn't mean it now.

222
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,070
All of that!

223
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,810
A style like it is happening.

224
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,750
315 years later I've seen a pretty big job.

225
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,570
I mean all of that.

226
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:19,870
I'm feeling all of that.

227
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:20,370
I'm feeling it wrong a lot of times
and I'm like... Without my human being.

228
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:20,510
We're alright?

229
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,310
Alright.

230
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,210
I don't like the rock sticks on us.

231
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:32,950
We kick everything,ank everything
We kick everything,ank everything

232
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:36,350
And call it for initiative
Yeah, we're here.

233
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:44,690
Me.

234
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,131
And be it again to
Where the fuck you are?

235
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,330
We made it.

236
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:51,310
Let's go slowly.

237
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:52,570
Are you okay?

238
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:53,571
Oh, way!

239
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:02,690
I'lliano when we watchian.

240
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,610
Oh, my God!

241
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,810
Oh, my God!

242
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:15,970
Oh, my God!

243
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:19,650
Oh, my God!

244
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:20,670
Oh, my God!

245
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:21,010
Oh, my God!

246
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,030
Oh, my God!

247
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,530
Oh, my God!

248
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,530
Oh, my God!

249
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,390
Oh, my God!

250
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,450
Oh, my God!

251
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,670
Oh, my God!

252
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,671
No!

253
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, my God!

254
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,450
Come on!

255
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,150
Oh, my God!

256
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,040
Hey!

257
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:30,500
Hey!

258
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:30,540
Hey!

259
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:30,960
What the?!

260
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:31,580
Are you okay?

261
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Oh, aah!

262
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,400
Oh, my God!

263
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:42,100
Boy, you're gonna bring it in.

264
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Aah!

265
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,020
I think I switched when I use my power.

266
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
A straw Konradic!

267
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Aah!

268
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Aah!

269
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm still there.

270
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,950
I'm going to have you.

271
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,980
Hi.

272
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Hi again.

273
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,860
I'm so sorry about early early.

274
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,960
We're looking for Kamala Khan.

275
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
No, I'm not there again!

276
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,996
There's just a new
iPad I haven't seen it yet.

277
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
I wish.

278
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,000
But if this is all Tom's secret
information, why is it on a clear case?

279
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,140
Well, just swipe it, I love it.

280
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,800
Oh, hi.

281
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Can you believe it?

282
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Intel on me?

283
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Believe me!

284
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Hi, I'm Intel.

285
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, my God.

286
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,820
Hey, what does that word stand for?

287
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,480
Strategic aerospace biophysics
and exolinguistic response.

288
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,700
It's classified.

289
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Sorry.

290
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,380
The heartlight powers, yes.

291
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,320
Okay.

292
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,180
Why do you have Intel on her?

293
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,160
Is there some sort of surveillance on us?

294
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,580
The famous is a strong word.

295
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,140
Well, man, your daughter is
the hero of that same Jersey city.

296
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,040
So, of course, we would
have Intel on someone like her.

297
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,360
And you're also
electromagnetically altered.

298
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,320
What does that mean?

299
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,880
Oh, it just means that we
both have light-based powers.

300
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:00,920
What's your?

301
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
What's your code, man?

302
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,740
Oh, I don't have a code, man.

303
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,120
Oh, we're choppin'.

304
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:06,121
No, thank you.

305
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
I'm Karen.

306
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,280
Captain Marvel also has light-based powers.

307
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,560
Probably not coincidence.

308
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:14,600
Not to mention, the two of
you came into direct contact.

309
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,830
with some malfunctioning jump points.

310
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,000
I still cannot believe
that Captain Marvel

311
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,196
was here and I didn't
even get to meet her.

312
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,816
You know, we're supposed
to be all like twinsies.

313
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,120
You know, we have the same name.

314
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,060
I would obviously then, I don't know,

315
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,841
we just give it the letter that I wrote
for her and we would go out for lunch.

316
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,240
Did you sit on, Carol?

317
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,180
I said that Captain Marvel
can absorb light energy.

318
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,700
I can see it.

319
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,280
And you, you can turn light into physical
matter, which I have never heard of.

320
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,000
But my work... I
can totally show you.

321
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
No!

322
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,220
Hi.

323
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Hi.

324
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,560
They don't seem related.

325
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,960
Whatever use of families are complicated.

326
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,180
Monica, you want to build Carolina?

327
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,720
Carolina, on your working theory?

328
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,040
Yeah.

329
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,520
Hi, Captain Marvel.

330
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,600
It is so good to see you.

331
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,700
Lieutenant Trouble.

332
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
You too.

333
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
It's Captain Rebel now.

334
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
Right.

335
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
Sorry.

336
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
So, what's new?

337
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Where is my sister?

338
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,640
I'm thinking that our joint exposure
to these unsteady jump points

339
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,300
and our susceptibility to
electromagnetic energy

340
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,340
has temporarily
entangled our world lines.

341
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Everything.

342
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,940
Entanglement, our light
powers are entangled,

343
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,900
so we switch places whenever
we use them at the same time.

344
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,300
Which would mean Kamala.

345
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
What did you get powers?

346
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,660
I walked through a radiation
shielding barrier of a witch hex

347
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,500
and now I can manipulate and see all
wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.

348
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,840
I'm very happy for you.

349
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
Where's our doctor?

350
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,680
Yes, please. Where is Kamala?

351
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,540
Where are you?

352
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,580
Where were you?

353
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:07,581
Who's Kamala?

354
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,150
The third person we're switching with.

355
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,920
Light powers, teenage girl.

356
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,980
How are you?

357
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
What are you doing?

358
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,180
I'm trying to switch.

359
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,120
Where is the version?

360
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,020
It's a work.

361
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,480
There are several, please,
tell them how to always switch.

362
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:20,680
Hey!

363
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,760
Where are we going?

364
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Here we go!

365
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,820
Here we go!

366
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:37,280
Oh!

367
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:38,281
Monica?

368
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
You've got to fly.

369
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
No, no, no.

370
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,140
I mean, I know.

371
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,896
But technically, I have to take it.

372
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,240
Yeah, well, you got to now.

373
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,640
Oh, Kamala's not going to
graduate from high school.

374
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,360
Come on!

375
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Here's your car!

376
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,960
Ah, it's cool, it's Carol.

377
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,520
They are associates of Captain Malcolm.

378
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,830
The Annihilator is here.

379
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,430
Yeah, well, she was.

380
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,950
And then these two just sort of appeared.

381
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,230
What about the band?

382
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,150
She's meddling, I need to straighten out.

383
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,610
Yeah, I still can't make out for
these imilitators in today before they...

384
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:48,930
This thing does...

385
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,731
Much more than
just... But it works.

386
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,090
Yes.

387
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,970
Yes, but if you give me
more time, I can make it safe.

388
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,050
No, no, we do it now.

389
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,230
Before the Annihilator appears.

390
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,310
Yeah, what should we do about...

391
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,950
These two?

392
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,850
I can't fly.

393
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,490
Do you guys have a spaceship I can borrow?

394
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:37,120
Mala, don't talk to them.

395
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:49,300
The Cree came here hopeful that
we could build a covenant of peace.

396
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
You don't know.

397
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,840
But then you sick the Annihilator on us.

398
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,900
Like we've earned it.

399
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,260
Once again, the Skrull
have betrayed the Cree.

400
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,120
And for that...

401
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,670
Okay.

402
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,626
Carol, we gotta give
peace to people out of here.

403
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,650
I'm her, Josh.

404
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,690
We need to evacuate your people now.

405
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,190
We have no way to go.

406
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Carol, just sit.

407
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:12,750
I need some power so that I can help now.

408
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,670
No!

409
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
Charles missions.

410
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,190
It was a ruse.

411
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,670
If it were, your intervention failed.

412
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:08,430
We don't need your help, any more.

413
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,340
I called a friend.

414
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,501
She can find a safe place for you.

415
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Is that okay?

416
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,830
We have no choice.

417
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Incoming.

418
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,190
You're right.

419
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,820
Thank you again.

420
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,640
Always.

421
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,440
I see that you've finally
found yourself a team.

422
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,500
It is unintentional.

423
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,020
No, I've been on some
unintentional teams myself.

424
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,320
I know, but here can stand tall.

425
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Without standing alone.

426
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,030
Take it from me, Mom.

427
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Hey.

428
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,411
Councilor Oliver will fix this.

429
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,060
I promise.

430
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,920
May I next meet you and be joyful.

431
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
Breathe.

432
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Do you remember?

433
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,740
When the sun used to shine on her.

434
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,100
How beautiful our home was.

435
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,260
Before her.

436
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,580
Before the annihilator.

437
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,680
I was there.

438
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,060
I heard her lies.

439
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,160
Claiming she was there to set us free.

440
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,420
But when she destroyed
the supreme intelligence.

441
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,440
She destroyed the dream.

442
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,180
For 30 years I have been
fighting alongside you.

443
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,120
Not only have I brought you peace.

444
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:36,140
But I have found a way
to return hell out of glory.

445
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,520
We need more power than that band
can provide if we to reignite our son.

446
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Then a man of energy.

447
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
But it would kill you.

448
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,900
If my life is the cosobia.

449
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,740
We will find the other end times.

450
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,080
There is no more time.

451
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,060
That is out of time.

452
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,970
Need a hand?

453
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Yeah.

454
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Hey, have me that laser.

455
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,460
You're micrometers.

456
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,010
Wow.

457
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,790
So you can do that because
you walk through a witching?

458
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,170
Yep.

459
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,410
When I got blipped back they
weren't sending us to space anymore.

460
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,390
Grounded us to investigate
earthbound anomalies.

461
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,910
That must have been hard.

462
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,001
Your mom told you that you
always dreamed of going to space.

463
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,570
They had a lot of proof.

464
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,530
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

465
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,870
What?

466
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,310
When you left.

467
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,270
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

468
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,490
I meant what I said.

469
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:24,630
I didn't know what I
was getting myself into.

470
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,370
I didn't know what I
explained to a little girl.

471
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,390
A little girl that hung on you.

472
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,870
Every word.

473
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,100
If you knew.

474
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:39,320
I was going to come back.

475
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
I just.

476
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,571
There was people that needed me.

477
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
You need to be a girl.

478
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,450
Yeah!

479
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,780
Hey.

480
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:06,920
I hope you don't mind.

481
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,360
I didn't have any other clothes.

482
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,660
It's totally fine.

483
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,740
It looks good.

484
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
I knew.

485
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,120
I'm.

486
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,121
I'm.

487
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,300
I'm really sorry.

488
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,940
By the way I spoke to you.

489
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Thank you.

490
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,018
I know that this
situation is an ideal, but it

491
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:31,780
is actually nice having
people on board again.

492
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,851
It gets pretty lonely out here.

493
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,520
Anytime you need company I will be there.

494
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,180
I will drop everything.

495
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:39,740
I will.

496
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:41,240
I will drop high school.

497
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
Don't do that.

498
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,700
But can't we start again?

499
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
Hi.

500
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
I'm Carol Thampers.

501
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,510
I'm Kamala Khan.

502
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,069
But when I'm fighting
crime on the streets of Jersey

503
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:57,020
City I go by Miss Marvel
and I hope that's okay.

504
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,126
Like copyright wise because honestly
I never thought I'd ever get to be even.

505
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,866
I'm just happening and
we're like touching each other.

506
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,531
I realize I should have asked permission.

507
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,220
So.

508
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,980
Where's the twins?

509
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,200
Okay.

510
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Alright.

511
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,191
Here's what we're going to do.

512
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,520
Captain Marvel.

513
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,060
You need to stop calling me that.

514
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,860
I used to change your diapers.

515
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,680
Oh, that was once.

516
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,616
And then I was told you
proceeded to vomit everywhere.

517
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,400
First of all, it's my ship.

518
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,480
So I make the game plan.

519
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

520
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,516
When's the last time you've met a team?

521
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,080
As early as last week.

522
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:25,940
Goose doesn't count.

523
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,320
Please.

524
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,540
You tried giving gooswers.

525
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,700
Like over a team?

526
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,480
No, no, no, no.

527
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:39,740
We're not a team.

528
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Professor Marvel.

529
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,620
Professor Marvel.

530
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:45,580
No.

531
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,640
No, no, no.

532
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,810
She will not.

533
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
Thank you.

534
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,471
Now that we've got
that out of the way team.

535
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,291
I've been trying to tell you, I think I
know how she's making the weird jump points.

536
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,720
She is one of these.

537
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,620
It's my nanny's bangle.

538
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,500
It started glowing really weirdly when
Darwin opened that first jump point.

539
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,340
Also, it once traveled
me through space in time.

540
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,140
It's probably related.

541
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,231
What you're describing is a quantum band.

542
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,130
I mean, I knew there were two of these.

543
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,251
I just did not expect the
other one to be in space.

544
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,340
They're a pair?

545
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,900
How do you have a quantum band?

546
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,280
Okay.

547
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,900
What is a quantum band?

548
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:21,600
A myth?

549
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,180
Or I thought it was a myth.

550
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,860
It's an ancient artifact.

551
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,411
So this is what Darwin
found on that before.

552
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,581
And then her and Kamala just
happened to stumble into each other?

553
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
What are the chances?

554
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,960
What you seek is seeking you.

555
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,400
It's inscribed on the bankle.

556
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,870
If the Cree legends are
true, the quantum bands were

557
00:42:40,882 --> 00:42:43,340
used to create every
jump point in the universe.

558
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,960
It's a teleportation network.

559
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,220
Two quantum bands working
in unison to connect the galaxy.

560
00:42:49,715 --> 00:42:52,620
She would now explain our
switchy entanglement situation.

561
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,160
Yeah, yeah, but Darwin only has one.

562
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,160
She must be overloading it with the
energy from her space hammer thingy.

563
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,516
It's called the universal weapon.

564
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,880
Oh, really?

565
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,820
I was going to call it Cosmo Rock.

566
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,880
Either way, she is using it to force
unstable jump points into the gray.

567
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,791
We have got to get to her
before she makes another one.

568
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,911
She has star charts and maps
on the screen's ownership.

569
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,480
Okay.

570
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,200
To where?

571
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,920
To the stars.

572
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Okay.

573
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,660
It's fine.

574
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,760
I've got one.

575
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,840
We will use this as a
scroll torture device.

576
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,480
Can we put it on our heads?

577
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:28,600
Yes.

578
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,300
It's fine.

579
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,140
You use it to access memories.

580
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,980
I've been using it to regain the
memories that the create took for me.

581
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,120
So, yeah.

582
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,140
But, you know, it has a lot of other uses.

583
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,220
It's safe.

584
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,640
You might want to get comfortable.

585
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,980
This is weird.

586
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,220
Wait.

587
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Go back.

588
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,200
Her band of swords, her
energy and redirects it.

589
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:05,500
It's like you gave her
power to use it against you.

590
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,840
Come on.

591
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,000
What about this?

592
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:11,720
There.

593
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,460
Those coordinates.

594
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,520
Can you read that?

595
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,040
Yes.

596
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
The matchline and galaxy.

597
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,020
All right.

598
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
I'll let you tell you.

599
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,860
That you want to go.

600
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You're so cute.

601
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,820
No, wait.

602
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:26,760
No, wait.

603
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:26,820
No, wait.

604
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
No, wait.

605
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,200
Are you asking me to come, Maria?

606
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,740
Oh.

607
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,580
The cancer is back.

608
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,260
So, I need you to take care of Goose.

609
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,520
No.

610
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,960
No.

611
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:44,800
I mean, you need it once.

612
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,540
You'll need it again.

613
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,780
I'm not taking the cat.

614
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's not a cat.

615
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,951
It should have been you that day.

616
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,540
That stupid race to the hangar.

617
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:58,540
I never want her to be Captain Rolfo.

618
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,380
Captain Rolfo sits here just fine.

619
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,440
And it's just until Monica gets back.

620
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,360
She bled me.

621
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,360
Girl, I don't want to relive this.

622
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,640
I'm sorry.

623
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
Stop now.

624
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,640
Please, Carol.

625
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,160
Remember why you're out there.

626
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,900
I'll look for a patient around.

627
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:21,460
What are they?

628
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,260
What do you tell them?

629
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,860
Remember to come home.

630
00:45:23,861 --> 00:45:25,000
Your mom?

631
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
She died honey.

632
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:26,720
No.

633
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,420
No.

634
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:27,820
No.

635
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,240
No.

636
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,500
I'll never do that again.

637
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm sorry.

638
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,420
It wasn't on campus.

639
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,580
I'd say your mom passed
away while I was flipped.

640
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,440
When I came back, no one was there.

641
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,310
Okay.

642
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,190
Thank you.

643
00:46:04,225 --> 00:46:05,225
She seemed really cool.

644
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:05,900
I'm sorry.

645
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:07,120
She was.

646
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,020
She was the best.

647
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,700
Well, we have to make deal
with what we know right now.

648
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,560
Here is what we do now.

649
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,350
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network is a

650
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:22,720
system of wormholes through
the space-time continuum,

651
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,420
AKA junk points, which allows us to
hop between different planetary systems.

652
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:30,260
Basically, it stretches and reconfigures
space without rupturing the continuum.

653
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,060
Like, cracking.

654
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,046
The more holes you
drill, the more destabilize

655
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,040
the shell becomes,
and then earthquake.

656
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,657
Bottom line, if she
keeps creating these jump

657
00:46:41,669 --> 00:46:43,691
points, it's going to get
really bad, really fast.

658
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,540
Question is, what does she want?

659
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,980
Tarnax used to be occupied by the
craze, so maybe the attack was a warning.

660
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,291
So she could be after
another former colony?

661
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,160
Is there a former craze
colony in the Magellanic?

662
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:59,140
At one point, the craze
colonized 25% of the galaxy.

663
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,336
If all she wanted was to
destroy Tarnax, why not bring

664
00:47:03,348 --> 00:47:06,300
in an armarys of bomb or
something? Why a jump point?

665
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,420
You're right. Jump points aren't weapons.
They're means of transportation.

666
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,597
Every jump point has
two sides, so if it's Tarnax's

667
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:15,520
atmosphere was siphoned
away, you had to go somewhere.

668
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
The Kala?

669
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:22,120
The Cree Civil War basically
bankrupted Hala of its natural resources.

670
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,940
The air is barely breathable.
They're suffering from a drought.

671
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:25,941
A drought?

672
00:47:26,195 --> 00:47:27,880
So she could be after water next?

673
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,240
Okay. We're in the Magellanic.
Can we find that?

674
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,740
Oceans cover 99.63% of the planet.

675
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,660
That is a very specific step.
You've been there.

676
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,760
No?

677
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,740
Yeah.

678
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,080
She's in there really weird.

679
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,480
Yeah, why are you being weird?

680
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,700
Okay. Consensus on Aladdin.

681
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,701
Aladdin.

682
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:58,640
Yeah, I say we do it. Get to Aladdin
and separate Dargan from their bingle.

683
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,360
We have our heading.

684
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:04,520
Kamala, you are not going
on any space adventures.

685
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,800
Nicholas has told me how
dangerous they can be.

686
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,320
It's just fury.

687
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,600
God.

688
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
Wait, where are you guys?

689
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,080
Where's Abu?

690
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:19,800
I don't know.

691
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
Really?

692
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,620
They insisted.

693
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,760
And your dad is not adjusting
very well to space travel.

694
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:26,500
Hey, babe.

695
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,440
So I'm in this crazy space
elevator and we're going up.

696
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,260
Or maybe we're going down.

697
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,480
Are there directions in space?

698
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,380
Yes, there are.

699
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,720
But no filming.

700
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,430
Smile.

701
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:53,790
You've had another series.

702
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,930
Reports are coming in across the network.

703
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:57,370
Seems everyone's been affected.

704
00:48:58,055 --> 00:49:00,473
Oh, we need to stop for
making another one and we can't

705
00:49:00,485 --> 00:49:02,870
risk intergalactic bodies
while being in the meantime.

706
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:04,170
This is Khan.

707
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:07,010
I'm sorry, but your daughter
will have to stay aboard by ship.

708
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:07,490
Oh, no.

709
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,450
And she'll go into the bottom of this.

710
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:08,830
Yes.

711
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,550
You wouldn't let her go.

712
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,930
Mrs. Khan, uh, is not that simple.

713
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:15,690
We need Kamala.

714
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:19,526
I mean, we found Nani's other bangle
and there's just where they're beautiful.

715
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,091
What kind of terrifying
woman using the other

716
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:22,586
one are her people
and we have to stop her.

717
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:23,730
They're telling me there's another bangle.

718
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:26,390
And they're going to use
that bangle to hurt you.

719
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,891
Monica, go take care of her.

720
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:31,090
We will and we will make sure
she gets back home in one piece.

721
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,710
I promise.

722
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:33,850
Stay the course.

723
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,230
We'll figure out how to
close those jumplings.

724
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,830
Kamala, you listen to me.

725
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,070
If anything happens to you, may I
ask you John Loonie, you tell her that.

726
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,190
I love you, Red.

727
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,910
I love you more.

728
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,430
Wait, what did she just say?

729
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,010
Nobody cares more than Captain Marvel.

730
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,090
Nobody gets more grief for it.

731
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,890
Trust me, Kamala is in
good hands with Carol.

732
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,530
It's wrong with that cat.

733
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,930
It's acting very weird.

734
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,990
Also, Mr. Furish is looking a little pudgy.

735
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,030
I think you're overfeiting her.

736
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,350
Googles.

737
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,260
No!

738
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:22,960
Firefly.

739
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:23,580
Nightlight.

740
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,360
Captain's Marvel.

741
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,720
Mr.'s Marvel.

742
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,880
Doctor.

743
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,230
Doctor Bright.

744
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,140
Mmm.

745
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,600
Professor Marvel.

746
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,120
You know us.

747
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:32,740
We know the girls.

748
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,080
Spectromation.

749
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,160
Oh, wait.

750
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:35,400
No.

751
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,760
How many times do I have to tell you
guys I do not want or need a code name?

752
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,096
Besides, none of it matters if
we're not coordinated out here.

753
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:43,760
Wanna figure out this one?

754
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,840
Do you think?

755
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,140
I would stay activated after a switch.

756
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,220
Good to know.

757
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:49,800
Okay.

758
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,120
Everyone together on three.

759
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:51,820
Ready?

760
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,440
One, two, three.

761
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,240
Now what?

762
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:55,900
She's saying go.

763
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,760
I'm going in three.

764
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,080
I'm going in three.

765
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,010
Now.

766
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,610
One, two, three.

767
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,970
She gave me eyes.

768
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,330
Now.

769
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:19,330
You hold on.

770
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,490
One, two, three.

771
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,490
One, two, three.

772
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:28,650
One, two, three.

773
00:51:28,651 --> 00:51:29,590
One, two, three.

774
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:30,770
One, two, three.

775
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:31,030
Three.

776
00:51:31,031 --> 00:51:33,890
One, two, three.

777
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:39,850
One, two, three.

778
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,290
That's why you will invest in index
funds rather than in individual stocks.

779
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:48,530
Of course.

780
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:52,610
Both the Roth IRA and 401K
are important for tax purposes.

781
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,426
You know I know we will fool about it.

782
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:54,830
I'm for autonomy.

783
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:55,490
Hey.

784
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:56,890
It's never too late.

785
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,150
And it's never too early.

786
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:58,790
Like I say.

787
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,170
How old are you?

788
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,350
26.

789
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,110
Wow.

790
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:03,350
Say name.

791
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:08,110
What's that?

792
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:08,810
What's that?

793
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:09,030
You have to find out.

794
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,330
You have to find out.

795
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:11,610
Can you send us a key?

796
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,530
Sweet thought.

797
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,230
Don't touch it.

798
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,231
What is that?

799
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,190
I have a foggiest idea.

800
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:20,490
I'm going to get it.

801
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:21,730
I don't know.

802
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,580
Should we tell fewer?

803
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,030
Twenty seconds.

804
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:28,750
To their job.

805
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,926
Do you guys realize how
crazy this is right now?

806
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,870
Like I'm, I'm in a spaceship
with two computers.

807
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,780
Also it's too late to go
to the bathroom because

808
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:36,246
I feel like it's going
to hit really soon.

809
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:37,706
No one will believe me like my nephew.

810
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,730
Yes, she would never.

811
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:52,170
No.

812
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:53,990
No.

813
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,330
No.

814
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:34,670
Okay.

815
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:35,830
Here we go.

816
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,450
Combs?

817
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,590
Wow.

818
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,111
I've always wanted to eat you.

819
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:42,070
Testing.

820
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,090
Testing what you're doing.

821
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:43,570
Mom, what are you?

822
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:43,950
Come on.

823
00:53:43,951 --> 00:53:44,951
We hear you baby.

824
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,110
Thank you.

825
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,170
So, real quick, before we get sucked in.

826
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:51,770
What the was that?

827
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,350
I should warn you that
I'm kind of famous here.

828
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,621
Well, did you know you're
famous everywhere, right?

829
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,841
This one's kind of different.

830
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,970
I hope the prince with the legal issue.

831
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,410
Okay.

832
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:03,830
Mm-hmm.

833
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:04,430
Let's go.

834
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:05,630
No matter what.

835
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:06,890
Follow my lead.

836
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,503
A lot of culture is
very specific, so there's

837
00:54:09,515 --> 00:54:11,770
going to be a bit of a
ceremony we have to do.

838
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:13,210
Like, just stay cool.

839
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,530
Hi, small child.

840
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:26,310
Hello.

841
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,070
Hello.

842
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:30,410
As if no time has passed.

843
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,330
So exciting that you're home.

844
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,230
Our Princess is home.

845
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,750
Princess.

846
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,990
Whoa.

847
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:44,910
Whoa.

848
00:54:46,175 --> 00:54:47,175
It's a technicality.

849
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,670
Carol, what is happening?

850
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:49,990
Their language is song.

851
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,926
Most of them won't
understand you unless you sing.

852
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,950
Come on.

853
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,410
Come on.

854
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:54,750
Let's go.

855
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:55,330
Let's go.

856
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:56,510
Let's go.

857
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,090
Let's go.

858
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:58,350
Let's go.

859
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:04,890
Let's go.

860
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:05,370
Let's go.

861
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,470
Let's go.

862
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,250
Let's go.

863
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,910
Let's go.

864
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,050
Come on.

865
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,850
Aren't you like dancing?

866
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,350
I am dancing.

867
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,630
And, yes, I am.

868
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:22,191
Don't think it's the
way that I... Wrong.

869
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:30,070
Ask him if someone... They're
having a... Can you tell anyone?

870
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,690
What?

871
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,570
That you're doing with this?

872
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:43,030
So, that's what you meant
when you said legal issue.

873
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,830
It is a barrage of convenience.

874
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,270
It's more of a diplomatic act.

875
00:55:46,271 --> 00:55:49,071
You know, it's like there's a power
of trouble, a major equal society.

876
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:54,450
We are friends, hmm, it's a long story,
I need to stand, maybe not, we're here.

877
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:21,160
I can't trust, I'm a pleasure to announce
to this lovely room full, two new faces.

878
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:35,251
One could be more
cheerful, but none the last

879
00:56:35,263 --> 00:56:41,400
we ring the bells to
Usher in whole bright days.

880
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,700
And another then, one, two, three.

881
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,100
The marbles!

882
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:56,260
Yeah!

883
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:58,360
Well, how is that even a thing already?

884
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,180
I'm kidding, what's really cool?

885
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,480
Where's the Princess?

886
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:18,330
What is she doing? She's respecting us all.

887
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:45,500
So many feelings right now.

888
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,220
Oh, well, I'm a snare afraid of her.

889
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:57,360
If I don't put her feet on the ground, give
me a chance here before it gets over me.

890
00:57:57,361 --> 00:58:00,060
So many different things, I don't want.

891
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,640
And trust that you alone
can't stop her alone.

892
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,140
How many chapters have
you kept a Marvel fan fiction?

893
00:58:07,141 --> 00:58:08,141
Is this gonna be him?

894
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,520
So many.

895
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,300
Don't forget.

896
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:12,301
Yeah!

897
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,940
My Princess... Roam the star!

898
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,480
We need to talk.

899
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,820
Okay, let's talk.

900
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:36,940
Oh wait, he doesn't have the same?

901
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,420
Yeah, he's bilingual.

902
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,760
We are severely underdressed, but could
you get us something real or bad already?

903
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,620
Of course.

904
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,940
Thank you.

905
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,460
Dear itself, our best one of best problems.

906
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,640
A worst enemy plot.

907
00:58:57,445 --> 00:58:59,160
Some kind of infestation by one.

908
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,100
Oh, it could be from a traitor from within.

909
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,880
Well, let's not go there yet.

910
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,640
This egg, you say, let's just
continue to study it, if anything.

911
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,080
Morning. 29 new objects.

912
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,580
Detective.

913
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,900
Oh, my gosh.

914
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,780
What about lady of light?

915
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,140
Frequency.

916
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,000
Pulsar.

917
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:25,380
No.

918
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,080
Pulsar.

919
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:26,880
Light lady.

920
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,180
Absolutely.

921
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,760
These are too much, right?

922
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:38,420
You made us quick.

923
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,920
Nothing grandiose.

924
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,060
Your three engines
disappear, but stay close.

925
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,620
Frustration to you.

926
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,650
This will work, beyond.

927
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:59,473
Remember, if you want to
keep unintentional switching

928
00:59:59,485 --> 01:00:02,190
to a minimum, entertainer
as long as you possibly can.

929
01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:05,290
Monica and I will get the jump
on her, and look at the bangle.

930
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:09,850
It's time.

931
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,130
Why have you called?

932
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,690
I've come here to pardon you.

933
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,190
For your crimes against the Korean Empire.

934
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:20,191
Neil.

935
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:22,530
To you?

936
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:25,870
I will live with you.

937
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:27,830
Okay.

938
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:14,990
Meet your scarf.

939
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,020
You're too late.

940
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,490
Why did you get that?

941
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:03,730
Grandma!

942
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:05,190
You think that is me in the mail?

943
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:07,210
Get into the car.

944
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:08,950
Right.

945
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,150
Get to the ship!

946
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,300
Get to the ship!

947
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:25,301
We've got to see a car.

948
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:33,260
We've got to see a car.

949
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:39,740
This side is a final system.

950
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,280
Are we doing something about these?

951
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:54,720
The space of the players offline.

952
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,360
We'll come in here with good news.

953
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,640
But don't.

954
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,360
That's not good news.

955
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:36,280
You guys in?

956
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:17,310
Get down here!

957
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:18,590
You can't hold a thought.

958
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:19,910
Can you hurt this woman?

959
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,260
No, I can lose her.

960
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,080
And what about the other twenty shit?

961
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,120
I can do this.

962
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:16,210
I can't leave now.

963
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:16,630
I can't leave now.

964
01:07:16,631 --> 01:07:17,330
I can't let this happen again.

965
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:18,350
I can't let this happen again.

966
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:19,010
I can do this.

967
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,290
And you'll tell us to try.

968
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,370
I can't treat you.

969
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:44,251
We left Atlanta to fend for themselves.

970
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:48,310
Darham was going to get my bagel, so
I made a tough call like you did on fire.

971
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,510
Don't try to be like me.

972
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,090
I messed this whole thing up.

973
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,450
If we weren't entangled, if we weren't here,
then you could be Darben and I'm sorry.

974
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,810
No, you don't understand.

975
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:05,570
The crew had been ruled by an AI
for a millennia that led them into a war.

976
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,790
I thought the only way
to stop it was to destroy it.

977
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,630
But I just made it worse.

978
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:17,450
I'm the reason why the Civil
War started in the first place.

979
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:19,770
I'm the reason why they
couldn't breathe the air.

980
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,901
That's how I got the name in the eye later.

981
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:27,290
And I never wanted you
to see that version of me.

982
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,941
Is that why you never came back?

983
01:08:33,965 --> 01:08:36,790
I thought if I fixed it,
then I could come home.

984
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,780
That's not how family works.

985
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:48,180
I never expected you to be
the mighty Captain Marvel.

986
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,760
I just wanted you.

987
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,740
Not what.

988
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:02,671
I'm really glad that you're here now.

989
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,630
And you, too.

990
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:13,430
I'm glad to be here.

991
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,790
I hope that goes without
saying, and I am sorry

992
01:09:17,802 --> 01:09:20,310
for coming out too
strong at the beginning.

993
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,431
I did not give you a lot of
space to be a real person.

994
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:28,870
I have to find her.

995
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:30,850
If anybody should be anywhere.

996
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,210
No.

997
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,570
Not anywhere.

998
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:36,888
She's targeting the
people that I care about and

999
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,210
stealing resources from
every place I call home.

1000
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,430
We have to more fear me.

1001
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:49,590
This is an emergency.

1002
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:53,970
I'll save the person who is reporting
to evacuation time in the field.

1003
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:55,670
What about you?

1004
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:56,050
What about you?

1005
01:09:56,051 --> 01:09:56,670
What about you?

1006
01:09:56,770 --> 01:10:01,230
The reason why we have that is to
evacuate 350 personnel of 15 escape homes.

1007
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:03,570
We've seen 5, 10, if you see
there's no one there enough.

1008
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:07,630
We'll fill her in many ones, as many people
as you can, then come up with a plan V.

1009
01:10:07,631 --> 01:10:08,631
Please, operations.

1010
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:14,630
I hope this.

1011
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,300
I hope this.

1012
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,340
I hope this.

1013
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
Hey.

1014
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,920
That's it.

1015
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,440
It's you.

1016
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:50,960
Come here.

1017
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,020
Hey.

1018
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,060
You.

1019
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,120
It's coming.

1020
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,340
It's you.

1021
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,920
Oh, no.

1022
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,800
Oh, no.

1023
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,020
We don't need help.

1024
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,300
We don't need help.

1025
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,680
We do.

1026
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,600
In the end, one of our students
always hugs us from this life to the next.

1027
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,140
What?

1028
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,260
No!

1029
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,020
Could everyone do the evacuation day?

1030
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,680
No!

1031
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:34,830
Can you imagine?

1032
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:39,470
What is going on, fam?

1033
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:40,890
Come on up.

1034
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:42,190
Come on up.

1035
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:43,270
You're so come on up.

1036
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:44,390
You're not?

1037
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:49,170
You look like a suker and
you're back safely written.

1038
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:50,550
You're not dead.

1039
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:52,470
I'm lost contact with Earth.

1040
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:54,630
We're officially out of bed and shipping.

1041
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:02,490
No, no, no, no, no.

1042
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:03,540
That's the plan.

1043
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:05,670
That's the plan?

1044
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:09,210
Much easier to transport a family of
cats than hundreds of crew members.

1045
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:11,751
So we're literally ready, guys?

1046
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:16,870
Come here, kitty.

1047
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,150
Attention, saver groups.

1048
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:21,130
Alright.

1049
01:12:21,131 --> 01:12:21,370
You're still here today.

1050
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:22,371
I'll be right back.

1051
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:31,130
We'll be right back.

1052
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:40,860
What are you doing?

1053
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:30,070
What are you doing?

1054
01:13:30,071 --> 01:13:31,071
Roger, I found her.

1055
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:33,030
Hey, come on.

1056
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:36,010
Drop it.

1057
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,970
it. I'll go.

1058
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:41,010
You've got to lift these home, baby.

1059
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,350
How'd it just do?

1060
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:43,330
Come on.

1061
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:43,810
Stop it?

1062
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:56,920
There's a new time of the early days.

1063
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:01,320
It's time for me.

1064
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,520
It's time for you to decide.

1065
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,620
I'm going to be the president of all this.

1066
01:14:09,621 --> 01:14:10,821
I'm going to be the president.

1067
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,260
I found our band.

1068
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:23,160
What? She owns our son.

1069
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,310
You leave it again?

1070
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:56,010
Yeah. I mean, the universe is in space.

1071
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:58,990
And if the universe isn't safe,
then we two guys aren't safe.

1072
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:01,390
Listen to me.

1073
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:05,910
You are chosen for a greater purpose, okay?

1074
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,810
So of course you must go now.

1075
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:11,670
That I will never let you cool.

1076
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:13,990
You understand that, right?

1077
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,770
I'm not counting on you.

1078
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,670
You could basically be done.

1079
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:22,030
You're better.

1080
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,450
I don't want to be a only child.

1081
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:25,650
Not again. Not with these two.

1082
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:32,190
Take his wives, take a
net manual to the bad guy.

1083
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,290
Yes, Mr. Fury.
He's trying to give it to me.

1084
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:35,350
I will take it home.

1085
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,697
Darwin's opened
another junk plant, and

1086
01:15:37,709 --> 01:15:39,530
we're going to need
both bangles to close it.

1087
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,341
And I guess you better make damn shoes.
You don't get a hands-on.

1088
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:44,410
Understand?

1089
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:21,910
Are you right?

1090
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:23,810
Hey, man!

1091
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:25,830
Hey, man!

1092
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,230
Hey, man!

1093
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:28,550
It's a Berry!

1094
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,380
There she is.

1095
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,120
We annihilate the house out.

1096
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:27,740
It's over, Dark Ben.

1097
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,360
No, I'm not yet.

1098
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:31,821
I know that you would do
anything to protect Hala.

1099
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:35,620
This will be the end of the Kree.
It will be the end of everything.

1100
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,600
It took for me.

1101
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,360
You're simply repairing your favor.

1102
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,640
Then, give me the bat.

1103
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,820
You're forgetting something?

1104
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,400
What? Me?

1105
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:05,010
This could have been so much easier.

1106
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:08,030
I don't know. I like our eyes.

1107
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:24,000
Get out of here!

1108
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,880
No!

1109
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,860
You're living up to your name again.

1110
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:33,540
I didn't want this.

1111
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,500
That seems to fully shoot.

1112
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,800
It doesn't have to end like this, Dark Ben.

1113
01:19:44,801 --> 01:19:46,180
Please, just give us the bangle.

1114
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,300
We're what?

1115
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,840
Hollis don't die because of you.

1116
01:19:51,945 --> 01:19:53,100
Why shouldn't you repass?

1117
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,180
Maybe she should.

1118
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,780
The reaction in your son's core has slowed.

1119
01:20:01,365 --> 01:20:03,616
And he's an incredible amount
of energy to jump-starting.

1120
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,920
And that's what you have, Carol.

1121
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:08,660
You can use your powers to save Hala.

1122
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:12,280
I've never done anything like that before.

1123
01:20:12,281 --> 01:20:15,500
In the last couple of days, I have done
a lot of things I've never done before.

1124
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,240
But you got this.

1125
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:25,290
For Hala.

1126
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:51,510
Try to knock you much
faster than you can make.

1127
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:19,790
I won't survive this, Dark Ben.

1128
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:21,510
Listen to me.

1129
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:12,130
I need to show you.

1130
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,140
So what are we looking at?

1131
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:04,220
We're self-propagating singularity with
negative mass and non-Newtonian topology.

1132
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:09,160
She tore a hole in space-time.

1133
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:15,120
That is a different
reality, leading into ours.

1134
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:17,700
You can even fix that in theory.

1135
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:21,380
You and Carol can reproduce the same
amount of energy that was used to open it.

1136
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,820
I will absorb it and then release
it, but from inside the tear.

1137
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,400
But what about the switching?

1138
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,960
Our powers aren't entangled anymore.

1139
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,080
Oh.

1140
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:34,600
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

1141
01:23:36,695 --> 01:23:39,298
But wait, you want us to
blast you with the same amount

1142
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:42,020
of power that punched a hole
in the fabric of space-time?

1143
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,460
If we want to UN-punch it.

1144
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,240
Yeah.

1145
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:50,240
I'm gonna need this.

1146
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,160
How are you feeling, Ms. Marvel?

1147
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,260
These bagels are all but
there's space and time to find me.

1148
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:08,920
I was born for this.

1149
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,420
It has to be now.

1150
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:19,350
Ms. Marvel.

1151
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:04,230
It's closing, Monica.

1152
01:26:04,231 --> 01:26:05,551
Monica, you gotta get out of her.

1153
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:27,720
Come on, you saved the world.

1154
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,720
Why are you praying?

1155
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,150
We lost Monica.

1156
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,801
She couldn't stop on the other side.

1157
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,080
And Carol.

1158
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,400
We went to some full promise.

1159
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:52,660
How would things?

1160
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:26,883
This is kitchen, but
there are these hot

1161
01:30:26,895 --> 01:30:29,310
sauce bar tips and
then there's this veneet.

1162
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:32,350
This is our looking tray, which I will say.

1163
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:34,310
It's a very good quality though.

1164
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:35,330
Oh, you can give it.

1165
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:36,230
Oh, no, no, no.

1166
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,910
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1167
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:39,130
It works for me.

1168
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:43,210
The vastness of it just gives you
a whole new perspective on life.

1169
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,181
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1170
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,050
And it was surprisingly cool.

1171
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:52,190
This place is amazing.

1172
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,150
Yeah, it is.

1173
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:57,831
Hey, did you stop flying that thing?

1174
01:30:58,150 --> 01:30:59,150
You want to check it out?

1175
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,250
Thank you.

1176
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:02,050
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1177
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:03,490
Come here, come here, come here.

1178
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,450
Oh, I'm so happy that
you won't save the door.

1179
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:19,031
Ahmed, it's gonna be a lovely
house to raise a family in, you know?

1180
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,580
Ahmed.

1181
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:23,060
This is so cool.

1182
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,240
All right, let's see, it's all you.

1183
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,880
What's the last thing?

1184
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:38,211
I actually don't know the key.

1185
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:40,480
I'm just looking after it.

1186
01:31:43,175 --> 01:31:44,656
She doesn't want to get against back.

1187
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,200
Yeah.

1188
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:49,240
Just until Monica gets back.

1189
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:51,940
I really miss her.

1190
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:53,820
We're good together.

1191
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:56,300
She got me thinking.

1192
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:10,140
Pizza delivery.

1193
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,800
Can I help you?

1194
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:25,150
Kate Bishop.

1195
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,521
Did you think you were the
only kid superhero in the world?

1196
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,760
23.

1197
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,960
Oh, I know.

1198
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:36,741
I've been running up on you.

1199
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,760
Where did you fit that?

1200
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:39,980
I found out of my couch.

1201
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:41,740
Okay.

1202
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:43,731
You just become part of
a much larger universe.

1203
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:48,800
Which, at the moment, is just me, mostly?

1204
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,416
I do have your lips out there.

1205
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,516
Did you know Ahmed had a daughter?

1206
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:51,960
What do you want?

1207
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,700
I'm putting together a taking.

1208
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:55,690
I know when you want it.

1209
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:02,920
Please.

1210
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:44,470
Mom, I've missed you so much.

1211
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,810
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:48,590
I'm not.

1213
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,300
I'm not a mysterious visitor.

1214
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:56,800
She's single disoriented.

1215
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:58,740
Where are we?

1216
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:00,620
What happened?

1217
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,340
We were hoping you could tell us.

1218
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:05,000
All we know is that binary found.

1219
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:06,860
My theory?

1220
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,520
You somehow crossed through.

1221
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:09,940
You were like terror in space time.

1222
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,020
You are now in reality
parallel to your own.

1223
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:15,860
Which is, of course, impossible.

1224
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:21,740
You think that we have
a confusion happening?

1225
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:25,200
Confusion is but the first step
on the journey to knowledge.

1226
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:27,980
I'll take it for you.

1227
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,580
Charles asked for an update.

1228
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,031
I'll combine and check out you later.
