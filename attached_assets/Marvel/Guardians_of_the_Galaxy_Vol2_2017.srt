1
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,241
There's a girl in this harbor town

2
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,370
And she works layin' whiskey down

3
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,880
They say, "Brandy, fetch another round"

4
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,010
And she serves them whiskey and wine

5
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,211
The sailors say "Brandy, you're a fine girl"

6
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,160
"What a good wife you would be"

7
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,160
- Come on!
- Slow down!

8
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,242
This way, my river lily! Come on!

9
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,201
Where are you taking me?

10
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,282
Come on, come on.

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,723
Look. Look!

12
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,888
Oh, it's beautiful!

13
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,042
I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil...

14
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,526
but it rooted quickly.

15
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,291
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,520
All across the universe.

17
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,882
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

18
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,644
but I like the way you say it.

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,491
My heart is yours...

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,204
Meredith Quill.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,720
I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.

22
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,488
Showtime, a-holes!

23
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,441
It will be here any minute.

24
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,364
Which will be its loss.

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,971
I thought your thing was a sword?

26
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,282
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...

27
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,125
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

28
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,320
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,131
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,648
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

31
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,120
It hurts.

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,167
It hurts?

33
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,485
I have sensitive nipples.

34
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,331
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

35
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,050
What about him? What's he doing?

36
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,766
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.

37
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,160
How is that a priority?

38
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,687
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,444
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,011
That's hardly important right now.

41
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,447
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.

42
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,524
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

43
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,162
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

44
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,370
I can clearly see you winking.

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

46
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,166
I am Groot.

47
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,448
They were not looking at you funny.

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,804
Well, that's intense.

49
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,201
Groot!

50
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,921
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

51
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,081
Hi.

52
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,807
No! Spit it out!

53
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,121
Come on!

54
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,531
Disgusting!

55
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,044
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

56
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,244
I must cut through it from the inside.

57
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,407
Huh?

58
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,046
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

59
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,008
Drax!

60
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,211
What is he doing?

61
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,091
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

62
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,083
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

63
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,720
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

64
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,490
I realize that.

65
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,402
There is a cut on its neck.

66
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,801
Rocket, get it to look up.

67
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,725
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

68
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,090
Watch it, Quill!

69
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,160
Yes! I have single-handedly
vanquished the beast!

70
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,361
What?

71
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,725
What are they called again?

72
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,526
Anulax batteries.

73
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,047
Harbulary batteries.

74
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,521
That's nothing like what I just said.

75
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,330
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

76
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,522
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.

77
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,207
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.

78
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,004
The cost of transgression is death.

79
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,491
We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.

80
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,645
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

81
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,246
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.

82
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,649
Impeccable, both physically and mentally.

83
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,080
We control the DNA of our progeny...

84
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,367
germinating them in birthing pods.

85
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,162
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

86
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,728
Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...

87
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,523
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

88
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,682
For academic purposes.

89
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,769
I would be honored, yes.

90
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,922
In the name of research...

91
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,606
I think that could be pretty, uh...

92
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,046
repulsive.

93
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,251
I'm not into that kind of casual...

94
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,527
Oh, please.

95
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,002
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

96
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,446
Bring it...

97
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,250
and we shall gladly be on our way.

98
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,606
Family reunion. Yay.

99
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,206
I understand she is your sister.

100
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,570
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

101
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,204
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

102
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,129
Do with her as you please.

103
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,449
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

104
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,411
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

105
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,091
My mother is from Earth.

106
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,169
And your father?

107
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,804
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

108
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,291
I see it within you.

109
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,003
An unorthodox genealogy.

110
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,410
A hybrid that seems particularly...

111
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,970
reckless.

112
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,044
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

113
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,482
but that isn't true at all.

114
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,642
Oh, shit.

115
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,968
I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?

116
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,401
I'm sorry. That was meant to be
behind your back.

117
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,170
Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.

118
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,084
You're telling me.

119
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,447
You wanna buy some batteries?

120
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,600
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar

121
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,125
and collect that bounty.

122
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,408
That stuff about my father...

123
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,682
Who does she think she is?

124
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,161
I know you're sensitive about that.

125
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,402
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

126
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,090
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.

127
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,925
I wasn't.

128
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,202
I don't care if you were.

129
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,169
Well, I feel like you do care.

130
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,561
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

131
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,962
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

132
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,006
Damn shadow.

133
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,200
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

134
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,044
those who dance, and those who do not.

135
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,090
Mmm-hmm.

136
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,442
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

137
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Oh, God.

138
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,524
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

139
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,250
Except one woman.

140
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,045
My Ovette.

141
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,888
I knew immediately she was the one for me.

142
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,646
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.

143
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,567
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

144
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,528
Wouldn't move a muscle.

145
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,411
One might assume she was dead.

146
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,971
That does sound pretty hot.

147
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,211
It would make my nether regions engorge.

148
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,249
Okay. I get it, yes.

149
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,323
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

150
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,927
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

151
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,241
Mmm.

152
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,165
I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.

153
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,805
No. It's not ripe yet...

154
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,007
and I hate you.

155
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,480
You hate me?

156
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,371
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.

157
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,602
And yet here you stand, a hero.

158
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,565
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

159
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,326
I swear.

160
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,606
No.

161
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
You're gonna live out the rest of your days

162
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,165
in a prison on Xandar...

163
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,651
wishing you could.

164
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,681
This is weird.

165
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,524
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

166
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,721
Why would they do that?

167
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,325
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

168
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,362
Dude!

169
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Right.

170
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,280
He didn't steal some of those.

171
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,124
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

172
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,203
What were you thinking?

173
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,600
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

174
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,205
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

175
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,647
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

176
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,529
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

177
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,926
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.

178
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,520
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

179
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,204
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

180
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,124
I was being sarcastic!

181
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,361
Oh, no!

182
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,640
You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice!

183
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,767
Now I look foolish!

184
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,608
Can we put the bickering on hold until after
we survive this massive space battle?

185
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,530
- More incoming!
- Good!

186
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,170
I wanna kill some guys!

187
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,405
You're not killing anyone.

188
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,085
All those ships are remotely piloted.

189
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,487
Damn it!

190
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,163
What is the delay, Admiral?

191
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,405
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...

192
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,721
and could destroy the entire fleet.

193
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,611
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

194
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,449
We hired them and they steal from us.

195
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,925
It is heresy of the highest order.

196
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,922
All command modules...

197
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,686
fire with the intent to kill.

198
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,809
What's the nearest habitable planet?

199
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,165
It's called Berhert.

200
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,050
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

201
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,204
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

202
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,204
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

203
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,960
Quill, to make it through that...

204
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,690
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.

205
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,887
Lucky for us, I...

206
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,485
I am.

207
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,008
What are you doing?

208
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,328
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

209
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,404
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

210
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,325
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

211
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,807
Stop it.

212
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,644
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...

213
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,842
and there's gonna be something squishy
in your pillow case.

214
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,240
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

215
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,169
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

216
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,082
You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.

217
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,810
Oh, it won't be my turd.

218
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,325
It will be Drax's.

219
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,644
I have famously huge turds.

220
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,526
We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?

221
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,001
Son of a...

222
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,611
Dude! Seriously!

223
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,201
Hey! Let me...

224
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,926
Idiots!

225
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
Well, that's what you get

226
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,645
when Quill flies.

227
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,285
Ow!

228
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,727
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

229
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,483
Our weapons are down.

230
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,722
20 clicks to the jump!

231
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,562
Hold on.

232
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,128
It's not ripe.

233
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,202
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

234
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,404
Yes!

235
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,602
15 clicks to the jump!

236
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,206
Come on!

237
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,490
Keep going!

238
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,926
10 clicks!

239
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,329
Die, spaceship!

240
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,406
You suck, Zylak.

241
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,607
Typical.

242
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,247
Five clicks!

243
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,645
Son of a...

244
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,923
They went around the field!

245
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,487
Someone destroyed all our ships!

246
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,880
What?

247
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,569
Who?

248
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,045
One click!

249
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,009
- What is that?
- Who cares?

250
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,446
That's the jump point! Go!

251
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,929
It's a guy.

252
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,882
Oh, my God.

253
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,485
He's still out there?

254
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,801
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

255
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,887
Prepare for a really bad landing!

256
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,528
That was awesome!

257
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,921
Yes!

258
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,366
Look at this!

259
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,724
Where is the other half of our ship?

260
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,881
My ship.

261
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,761
Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field...

262
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,650
had you flown with what's between your
ears instead of what's between your legs!

263
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,164
If what's between my legs had a hand on it...

264
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,448
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.

265
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,249
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

266
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,081
More like because he stole...

267
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,321
the Anulax batteries!

268
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,767
They're called Harbulary batteries.

269
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,564
No, they're not!

270
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,404
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch? Hmm?

271
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,611
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

272
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,723
I did it because I wanted to!

273
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,529
Dick.

274
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,609
What are we even talking about this for?

275
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,240
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

276
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,287
How little?

277
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,647
Well, I don't know, like this?

278
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,490
A little one-inch man saved us?

279
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,802
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.

280
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,327
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

281
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,811
Don't call me a raccoon!

282
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,646
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

283
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,766
I meant trash panda.

284
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,326
Is that better?

285
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,564
I don't know.

286
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,961
It's worse. It's so much worse.

287
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,360
You son of a...

288
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,248
Hey!

289
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,731
- I've had it with you!
- No! Back up!

290
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,570
Someone followed you through the jump point.

291
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,887
Set me free, you'll need my help.

292
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,166
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

293
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,209
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

294
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,521
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

295
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,721
No, I won't.

296
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,168
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

297
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,288
I bet it's the one-inch man.

298
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,886
After all these years, I've found you.

299
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,370
And who the hell are you?

300
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,483
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

301
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,882
My name is Ego...

302
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,651
and I'm your dad, Peter.

303
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,645
You know what they say...

304
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,730
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."

305
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,931
Yondu!

306
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,608
Come on down!

307
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,408
After going around years in circles...

308
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,449
with this woman I end up marrying.

309
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,291
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

310
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,885
"but you're losing your mind!"

311
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,008
Then again, she's always been that way.

312
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,969
I could never trust her. You know?

313
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,121
Stakar.

314
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,089
It's been some time.

315
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,205
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

316
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,241
- Sir!
- Stakar!

317
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,801
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

318
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,970
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.

319
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,645
Please, sir. Please!

320
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,080
Get away from me.

321
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,324
You can go to hell then!

322
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,648
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

323
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,849
So what are you following us for?

324
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,365
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

325
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,960
I don't gotta listen to nothing!

326
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,371
You betrayed the code!

327
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,363
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

328
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,364
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

329
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,050
You didn't know because you didn't
want to know because it made you rich.

330
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
I demand a seat at the table!

331
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,562
I wear these flames, same as you.

332
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,802
You may dress like us...

333
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,367
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

334
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,449
And the Colors of Ogord...

335
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,002
will never flash over your grave.

336
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,691
If you think...

337
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,043
I take pleasure in exiling you...

338
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,410
you're wrong.

339
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,570
You broke all our hearts.

340
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,561
Ah, pathetic.

341
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,682
First, Quill betrays us...

342
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,128
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

343
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,441
We followed him because he was the one...

344
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,046
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.

345
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,481
Seems he's goin' soft.

346
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,481
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?

347
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,929
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

348
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,483
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.

349
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,250
Who the hell is that?

350
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,964
Yondu Udonta...

351
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,802
I have a proposition for you.

352
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,408
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

353
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,688
when your mother passed away.

354
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,649
But instead of returning you...

355
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,649
Yondu kept you.

356
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,406
I have no clue as to why.

357
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,005
Well, I'll tell you why.

358
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,240
Because I was a skinny little kid who could
squeeze into places adults couldn't.

359
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,845
It made it easier for thievin'.

360
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,288
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

361
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,400
I thought Yondu was your father.

362
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,642
What? We've been together this whole time...

363
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,610
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

364
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,000
You look exactly alike.

365
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,810
One's blue!

366
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,090
No, he's not my father!

367
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,720
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

368
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,689
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

369
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,842
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.

370
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,365
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

371
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,522
Oh, that son of a bitch.

372
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,045
How'd you locate us now?

373
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,844
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...

374
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,441
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

375
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,001
What say we head out there right now?

376
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,322
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

377
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,880
I promise you...

378
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,363
it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.

379
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,361
And there...

380
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,526
I can explain your very special heritage.

381
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,683
Finally get to be...

382
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,571
the father I've always wanted to be.

383
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,525
Excuse me.

384
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,411
I've gotta take a whiz.

385
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,289
I'm not buying it.

386
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,204
Let's go take a walk.

387
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,410
I am Mantis.

388
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,571
What are you doing?

389
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,245
Smiling.

390
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,526
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

391
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,762
Not if you do it like that.

392
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,280
Oh...

393
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,931
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

394
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,802
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

395
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,847
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.

396
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,727
Yes.

397
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,646
That is called a practical joke!

398
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,962
I liked it very much!

399
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,804
I just made it up!

400
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,641
Give me a break!

401
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,040
After all this time, you're gonna
show up, and all of a sudden...

402
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,920
- you wanna be my dad?
- I hear you.

403
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,160
And by the way, this could be a trap.

404
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,890
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

405
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,720
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...

406
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,840
But what?

407
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,320
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

408
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,447
Who?

409
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,840
He owned a magic boat?

410
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,166
David Hasselhoff?

411
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,162
Right.

412
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,402
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

413
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,482
Why did he talk again?

414
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,247
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

415
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,006
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

416
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,920
and you would tell all the other children...

417
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,240
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

418
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,920
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.

419
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,401
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

420
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,600
I love that story.

421
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,720
I hate that story.

422
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,325
It's so sad!

423
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,529
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.

424
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,365
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!

425
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,804
That's my point, Peter.

426
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,484
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

427
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,365
If he ends up being evil...

428
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,410
we will just kill him.

429
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,041
You're leaving me with that fox?

430
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,326
He's not a fox.

431
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,560
Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.

432
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,008
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

433
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,561
It'll be just a couple of days.

434
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,570
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

435
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,643
What if the Sovereign come?

436
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,882
There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.

437
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,644
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

438
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,404
God, you're like an old woman.

439
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,244
Because I'm wise?

440
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,168
Why do you have so much luggage?

441
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,482
I don't want Groot playing with my things.

442
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,131
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

443
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,966
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

444
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,922
Because it's working.

445
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,565
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again

446
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,766
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

447
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,924
And if you don't love me now

448
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,203
You will never love me again

449
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,285
I can still hear you saying

450
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,442
You would never break the chain

451
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,809
And if you don't love me now

452
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,611
You will never love me again

453
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,804
I can still hear you saying

454
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,362
You would never break the chain

455
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,368
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

456
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,761
Oh...

457
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,487
No one has ever asked me a personal question.

458
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,410
Your antennae, what are they for?

459
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,161
Their purpose?

460
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,163
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

461
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,402
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

462
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,487
I say...

463
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,041
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

464
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,010
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.

465
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,322
Right. And if it's anything other than...

466
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,882
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

467
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,520
They are not for feeling doorways.

468
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,401
I think...

469
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,331
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

470
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,881
What are those?

471
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,562
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

472
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,484
- You read minds?
- No.

473
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,920
Telepaths know thoughts.

474
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,526
Empaths feel feelings.

475
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,681
Emotions.

476
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,486
May I?

477
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,045
All right.

478
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,761
You feel love.

479
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,404
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.

480
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,721
No!

481
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,723
Romantic, sexual love.

482
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,331
No, I don't.

483
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,090
- For her!
- No!

484
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,686
Okay.

485
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,882
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

486
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,361
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!

487
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,851
You must be so embarrassed!

488
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,569
Do me! Do me!

489
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,880
I have never felt such humor!

490
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,402
So unbelievably uncool.

491
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,205
Oh, Quill.

492
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,531
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

493
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,521
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

494
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,681
Yeah, like what?

495
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,689
If I touch someone who is sad...

496
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,525
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.

497
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,560
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

498
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,769
But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.

499
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,806
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

500
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,121
Do one of those on me.

501
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,284
Sleep.

502
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,685
I love this song.

503
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,281
Huh?

504
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,766
There!

505
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,401
Ah...

506
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,008
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys, are you?

507
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,047
Move!

508
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,966
Crap.

509
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,005
Hey there, rat!

510
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,481
How's it going, you blue idiot?

511
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,048
Not so bad.

512
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,601
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.

513
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,604
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...

514
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,685
has offered us a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...

515
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,800
because she wants

516
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,450
to kill y'all.

517
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,840
Your friend...

518
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,684
There's too many of them.

519
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,049
He needs my help. If you care about him...

520
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,846
you need to get me out of these bonds.

521
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,363
They are going to kill him!

522
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,682
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.

523
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,768
I put a tracer on your ship back there...

524
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,291
during the war over Xandar.

525
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,201
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot...

526
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,249
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.

527
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,481
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

528
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,201
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

529
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,725
Otherwise, you'd what?

530
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,410
We'll take them batteries.

531
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,047
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?

532
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,521
That Priestess offered us a million.

533
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,451
A quarter is only one third of that!

534
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,726
A quarter ain't a third.

535
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,689
A quarter is 25.

536
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,841
No.

537
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,321
We can't even buy a pair
of boots with 25 units.

538
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,487
Enough!

539
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,487
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

540
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,360
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.

541
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,083
That ain't right!

542
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,289
I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.

543
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,761
No matter how many times Quill betrays you...

544
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,810
you protect him like
none of the rest of us much matter!

545
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,961
Yeah!

546
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,645
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

547
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,767
Take it easy, Kraglin.

548
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,400
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

549
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,649
Suppose it's time for a change in leadership.

550
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,001
Put your damn guns down!

551
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,446
Whoa! Whoa!

552
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,047
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

553
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,925
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

554
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,764
Well, hello, boys.

555
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,010
It's not ripe.

556
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,280
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

557
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,840
Wow. You have your own planet?

558
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,720
Come on. No larger than your Earth's Moon.

559
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,445
Humility.

560
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,011
I like it.

561
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,727
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

562
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,370
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

563
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,769
What are you exactly?

564
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,163
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

565
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,006
A Celestial, like a god?

566
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,766
Mmm, small "g," son.

567
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,720
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

568
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,041
Whoa!

569
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,482
I don't know where I came from exactly.

570
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,608
First thing I remember is flickering...

571
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,083
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

572
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,526
and entirely alone.

573
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,523
Over millions of years...

574
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,287
I learned to control the molecules around me.

575
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,723
I grew smarter and stronger.

576
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,730
And I continued building from there...

577
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,008
layer by layer...

578
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,766
the very planet you walk on now.

579
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,206
Whoa.

580
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,961
But I wanted more.

581
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,850
I desired...

582
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,481
meaning.

583
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,651
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...

584
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,565
"besides just me," I thought.

585
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,765
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.

586
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,565
I created...

587
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,361
what I imagined biological life to be like...

588
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,286
down to the most minute detail.

589
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,765
Did you make a penis?

590
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,126
Dude!

591
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,520
What is wrong with you?

592
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,684
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

593
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,841
He would smush her!

594
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,287
I don't need to hear how my parents...

595
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,521
Why?

596
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,880
My father would tell the story

597
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,883
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.

598
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,485
That's disgusting.

599
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,085
It was beautiful.

600
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,850
You Earthers have hang-ups.

601
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,482
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

602
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,370
Ha! Thank you!

603
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,646
It's not half bad.

604
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,245
- Oh.
- Ugh.

605
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,047
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

606
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,964
and all the accompanying junk.

607
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,082
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...

608
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,244
as I set out amongst the stars...

609
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,127
until I found...

610
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,964
what I sought.

611
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,721
Life.

612
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,761
I was not alone in the universe after all.

613
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,403
When did you meet my mother?

614
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,244
Not long after.

615
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,688
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

616
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,763
I called her my river lily.

617
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,526
And from that love, Peter...

618
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,366
you.

619
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,167
I have searched for you for so long.

620
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,444
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

621
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,366
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

622
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,090
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

623
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,081
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

624
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,049
This is mutiny!

625
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,840
This is mutiny!

626
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,045
You're scum!

627
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,960
Oh!

628
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,641
Captain!

629
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,371
Help me! Please!

630
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,085
Captain!

631
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,044
You're the one what killed those men...

632
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,449
by leading them down the wrong path.

633
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,970
Because you're weak.

634
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,965
And stupid!

635
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,088
It's time for the Ravagers...

636
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,926
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

637
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,450
Taserface!

638
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,801
I'm sorry. Your name is...

639
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,610
It's Taserface?

640
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,411
That's right.

641
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,087
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

642
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,569
It's metaphorical!

643
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,562
Yeah!

644
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,162
For what?

645
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,206
For it is a name what strikes fear...

646
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,125
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

647
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,040
Okay.

648
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,880
Okay...

649
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,241
whatever you say.

650
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,091
You shut up.

651
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,446
You're next.

652
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,685
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...

653
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,801
What?

654
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,084
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

655
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,289
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

656
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,520
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...

657
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,126
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?

658
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,561
"Taserface!"

659
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,211
That's how I hear you in my head!

660
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,282
What was your second choice?

661
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,283
Scrotum Hat?

662
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,211
New plan. We're killing you first.

663
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,689
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

664
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,845
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

665
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,844
That's enough killing for today.

666
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,490
She's the daughter of Thanos.

667
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,882
I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

668
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,884
That was when Daddy was paying my bills.

669
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,681
The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.

670
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,684
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

671
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,845
I assure you...

672
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,844
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

673
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,843
or a talking woodland beast.

674
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,083
I want 10% of the take...

675
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,529
and a couple more things.

676
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,010
We got a whole box of hands...

677
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,003
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

678
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,369
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

679
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,764
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

680
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,367
Well, here it is. It's the best ship we got.

681
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,210
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

682
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,681
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

683
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,968
What are you gonna do with your share?

684
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,167
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

685
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,089
battle one another in training.

686
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,201
Every time my sister prevailed...

687
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,682
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

688
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,525
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

689
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,443
But she won...

690
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,447
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

691
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,401
So after I murder my sister...

692
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,720
I will buy a warship

693
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,802
with every conceivable instrument of death.

694
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,601
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

695
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,205
piece by piece...

696
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,762
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

697
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,049
I know every single day.

698
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,285
Yeah.

699
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,489
I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.

700
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,243
Or a nice hat.

701
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,131
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

702
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,289
Anyways, happy trails.

703
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,527
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

704
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,806
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.

705
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,007
Peter...

706
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,924
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

707
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,491
But you left...

708
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,450
the most wonderful woman ever...

709
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,130
to die alone.

710
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,722
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

711
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,042
If I don't return regularly to my planet...

712
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,605
and the light within it...

713
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,330
this form will wither and perish.

714
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,482
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

715
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,563
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

716
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,968
I loved your mother, Peter!

717
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,487
I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth...

718
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,484
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

719
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,041
I know exactly what that feels like!

720
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,964
I had to watch her die!

721
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,484
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

722
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,120
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

723
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,167
But you're not one of them.

724
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,721
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

725
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,722
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

726
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,564
and the light within.

727
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,129
They are a part of you, Peter.

728
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,644
What do you mean?

729
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,363
Give me your hands, son.

730
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,486
Here.

731
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,249
Hold them like that.

732
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,050
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

733
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,170
Take your brain to the center of this planet.

734
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,923
Yes!

735
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,089
Whoa!

736
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,605
Yes! It's okay.

737
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,841
Just relax. Concentrate.

738
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,122
You can do it. Bring it back.

739
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,761
Yes!

740
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,210
Yes, now shape it.

741
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,244
Feel that energy.

742
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,401
Yes.

743
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,051
You're home.

744
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,761
Peter...

745
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,170
How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?

746
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,690
Ego found me in my larva state.

747
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,285
Orphaned on my homeworld.

748
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,811
He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.

749
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,691
So you're a pet?

750
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,291
I suppose.

751
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,167
People usually want cute pets.

752
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,607
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

753
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,091
I am hideous?

754
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,402
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

755
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,646
But that's a good thing.

756
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,841
Oh?

757
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,880
When you're ugly, and someone loves you...

758
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,486
you know they love you for who you are.

759
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,207
Beautiful people never know who to trust.

760
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,004
Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.

761
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,683
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

762
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,367
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

763
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,846
She was like you.

764
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,765
Disgusting?

765
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,001
Innocent.

766
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,201
Drax?

767
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,524
There's something I must tell you.

768
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,081
What's going on?

769
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,129
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

770
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,682
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

771
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,605
You're not ugly. Drax!

772
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,091
What are you talking about?

773
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,401
Mantis...

774
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,922
can you show us where we'll be staying?

775
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,284
Why are there no other beings on this planet?

776
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,522
The planet is Ego.

777
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,927
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

778
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,926
And you're not a flea?

779
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,441
I'm a flea with a purpose.

780
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,650
I help him sleep.

781
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,963
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

782
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,087
Nothing.

783
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,929
Your quarters are this way.

784
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,002
We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.

785
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,449
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

786
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,168
Okay, Taserface.

787
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,002
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

788
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,571
"Hi," Taserface!

789
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,246
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

790
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,965
No, Gef.

791
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,804
It's too adorable to kill.

792
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,803
Take it to the tailor.

793
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,643
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

794
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,842
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

795
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,171
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

796
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,729
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

797
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,689
But I was young...

798
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,087
and greedy, and stupid.

799
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,168
Like you stealing those batteries.

800
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,845
That was mostly Drax.

801
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,841
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

802
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,121
we weren't so different from
you and your friends.

803
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,003
The only family I ever had.

804
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,124
When I broke the code...

805
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,044
they exiled me.

806
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,805
This is what I deserve.

807
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,684
Slow down, drama queen.

808
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,530
You might deserve this, but I don't.

809
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,444
We gotta get outta here.

810
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,046
Where's Quill?

811
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,770
He went off with his old man.

812
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,209
- Ego?
- Yeah.

813
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,328
It's a day for dumbass names.

814
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,841
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

815
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,760
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

816
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,320
You like a professional asshole or what?

817
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,480
Pretty much a pro.

818
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,245
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

819
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,609
He was skinny.

820
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,124
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

821
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,601
Uh-huh.

822
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,249
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

823
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,726
But we're gonna need your little friend.

824
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,247
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

825
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,687
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

826
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,491
Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.

827
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,529
He's goddang precious!

828
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,281
Psst!

829
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,289
Hey, twig!

830
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,011
Come here.

831
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,720
Come on.

832
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,281
Aw, man...

833
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,925
what did they do to you?

834
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,486
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

835
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,529
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

836
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,730
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

837
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,524
the thing I wore on my head.

838
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,290
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

839
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,766
You got it?

840
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,010
That's my underwears.

841
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,208
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

842
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,402
You have to explain it more careful.

843
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,362
It's a prototype fin.

844
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,605
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

845
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,364
You explain it this time.

846
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,051
All right.

847
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,769
That's Vorker's eye.

848
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,922
He takes it out when he sleeps.

849
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,445
Go. Look again.

850
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,011
But leave the eye here.

851
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,486
Why?

852
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,005
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

853
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,567
and he's not gonna know...

854
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,961
where his eye is!

855
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,730
That's a desk.

856
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,605
We told you it was this big.

857
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,767
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

858
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,651
with a bunch of severed human toes.

859
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,407
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

860
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,366
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

861
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,885
Okay?

862
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,289
What? No!

863
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,566
He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.

864
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,051
That's not what I said!

865
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,200
I am Groot.

866
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,327
He's relieved you don't want him to.

867
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,970
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

868
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:24,803
I am Groot.

869
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,161
On anyone, not just himself.

870
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,160
I am Groot.

871
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,163
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

872
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,687
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.

873
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,486
That's why you don't like hats?

874
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,967
This is an important conversation right now?

875
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,681
That ain't it.

876
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,045
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

877
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,923
They killed all my friends.

878
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,486
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

879
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,042
One more thing.

880
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,361
You got any clones of Quill's
old music on the ship?

881
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,561
Ah.

882
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,163
He's got it!

883
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,845
Yondu's got the fin!

884
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,922
Go!

885
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,282
Down there!

886
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,003
Oh!

887
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,525
You maniac.

888
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,767
The whole ship's gonna blow.

889
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,284
Not the whole ship.

890
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,287
Who is this?

891
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,729
I am sending you
the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

892
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,089
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, Captain!

893
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,766
I only ask one thing.

894
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,890
That your High Priestess...

895
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,522
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

896
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,729
Taserface!

897
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,320
Where to, Captain?

898
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,481
Ego.

899
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,167
No, boy!

900
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,602
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

901
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,727
I know that.

902
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,247
We are about to do 700!

903
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,248
So I guess this could all be mine someday.

904
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,126
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

905
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,089
What are you doing, Peter?

906
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,691
Dance with me.

907
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,365
I'm not going to dance with you.

908
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,289
This is Sam Cooke...

909
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,003
one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

910
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,162
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

911
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,851
If you ever tell anyone about this...

912
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,411
I will kill you.

913
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,051
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

914
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,091
What unspoken thing?

915
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,244
This...

916
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,210
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

917
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,931
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

918
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,480
but never say it because if they do,

919
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,641
the ratings would go down...

920
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,881
sort of thing.

921
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,485
There's no unspoken thing.

922
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,440
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,

923
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,681
then it would be spoken...

924
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,611
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

925
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,930
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

926
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,003
No, that's not what I...

927
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,370
What we should be discussing right now
is something about this place.

928
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,244
It doesn't feel right.

929
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,962
What are you talking about?

930
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,406
You're the one who wanted me to come here!

931
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,800
That girl Mantis...

932
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,041
she's afraid of something.

933
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,528
Why are you trying to take this away from me?

934
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,886
I'm not trying...

935
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,963
He's my father. He's blood.

936
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,844
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.

937
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,088
Again, you made me come here!

938
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,163
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

939
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,971
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

940
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,885
This is real! I'm only half human, remember?

941
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,326
That's the half I'm worried about.

942
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,690
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...

943
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,201
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.

944
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,886
You were insufferable to begin with.

945
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,201
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

946
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,725
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

947
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,850
You know what? This is not Cheers after all!

948
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,844
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...

949
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,720
to open themselves up to new possibility,

950
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,484
and the other person is a jerk....

951
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,440
who doesn't trust anybody!

952
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,284
It's a show that doesn't exist.

953
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,851
That's why it would get zero ratings!

954
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,488
I don't know what Cheers is!

955
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,650
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

956
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,530
I thought you already had.

957
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,280
Damn it.

958
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,441
Psychopath!

959
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,564
Are you kidding me?

960
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,842
I win.

961
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,807
I win. I bested you in combat.

962
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,883
No. I saved your life.

963
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,883
Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.

964
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:55,927
You let me live!

965
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,969
I don't need you always trying to beat me!

966
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,766
I'm not the one that just flew across the
universe just because I wanted to win.

967
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,560
Do not tell me what I want.

968
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,051
I don't need to tell you what you want!

969
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,241
It's obvious!

970
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,370
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

971
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,765
You were all I had.

972
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,805
But you were the one who needed to win.

973
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,327
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

974
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,122
and my brain from my skull...

975
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,169
and my arm from my body...

976
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,928
because of you.

977
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,410
(LOOKING GLASS' "BRANDY

978
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,966
You all right, son?

979
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,971
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

980
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,965
Yeah.

981
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,849
It's fortuitous...

982
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,240
you listening to this song.

983
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,970
- You know...
- Brandy?

984
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,487
By Looking Glass?

985
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,691
A favorite of your mom's.

986
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,165
Yeah, it was.

987
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,170
One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.

988
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,522
Perhaps its very greatest.

989
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,681
Yes!

990
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,969
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

991
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,004
He came on a summer's day

992
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,960
Bringing gifts from far away

993
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,520
Like the child I put in your mother...

994
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,603
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

995
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,809
Brandy, you're a fine girl

996
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,611
What a good wife you would be

997
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,371
My life, my love

998
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,808
My lady is the sea

999
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,803
The sea calls the sailor back.

1000
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,486
He loves the girl, but that's not his place.

1001
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,205
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.

1002
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,927
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

1003
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,688
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

1004
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,966
No, Peter...

1005
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,083
death will remain a stranger to both of us...

1006
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,642
as long as the light burns within the planet.

1007
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,727
I'm immortal?

1008
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,241
Mmm-hmm.

1009
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,087
Really?

1010
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,084
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1011
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,323
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

1012
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,801
like how you made this whole planet?

1013
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,327
It might take you
a few million years of practice...

1014
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,767
before you get really good at it. But, yes!

1015
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,921
What!

1016
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,682
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

1017
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:43,887
and Heather Locklear.

1018
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,201
You can do anything you want.

1019
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,686
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1020
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,003
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

1021
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,686
Only we can remake the universe.

1022
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,320
Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos...

1023
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,324
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1024
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,527
How?

1025
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,365
Come with me.

1026
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,964
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1027
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,970
Drax! We need to talk.

1028
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,963
I'm sorry.

1029
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,327
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

1030
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,561
What?

1031
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:36,963
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1032
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,525
No, that's not what I...

1033
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,531
What are you doing?

1034
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,481
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1035
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,971
Drax...

1036
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,641
I don't like you like that.

1037
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,161
I don't even like the type of thing you are.

1038
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,766
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

1039
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,491
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1040
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,409
I should have told you earlier.

1041
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,604
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1042
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,361
What is that?

1043
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,407
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

1044
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,723
Everything around us, including the girl...

1045
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,362
Everything is temporary.

1046
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,330
We are forever.

1047
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,965
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1048
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,521
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

1049
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,648
which is why you're here.

1050
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,968
I told you how all those years ago...

1051
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,250
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1052
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,450
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

1053
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,406
it was all so...

1054
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,723
disappointing.

1055
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,567
And that is when I came...

1056
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,406
to a profound realization.

1057
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,885
My innate desire to seek out other life...

1058
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,644
was not so that I could walk among that life.

1059
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,041
Peter...

1060
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,289
I have found meaning.

1061
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,525
I see it.

1062
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,724
Eternity!

1063
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,650
Oh, my God.

1064
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,169
We need to get off this planet.

1065
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,286
Oh, man.

1066
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,801
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted...

1067
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,850
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.

1068
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,000
What the hell you doing, boy?

1069
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,162
I could tell by how you talked about him...

1070
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,651
this Ego is bad news.

1071
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,450
We're here to save Quill.

1072
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,650
For what? Huh? For honor? For love?

1073
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,804
No. I don't care about those things.

1074
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,201
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!

1075
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,125
I can lord this over him forever.

1076
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,724
What are you laughing at me for?

1077
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,082
You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

1078
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,526
I know who you are.

1079
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,842
You don't know anything about me, loser.

1080
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,287
I know everything about you.

1081
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,241
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...

1082
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,765
but, actually, you're the most scared of all.

1083
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:07,762
Shut up!

1084
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,327
I know you steal batteries you don't need...

1085
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,086
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

1086
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,526
because just a little bit of love...

1087
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,968
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1088
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,600
I said shut up!

1089
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,163
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1090
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,651
I'm serious, dude!

1091
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,371
Just like my own damn parents who sold me...

1092
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,409
their own little baby, into slavery.

1093
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,281
I know who you are, boy.

1094
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,482
Because you're me.

1095
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,082
What kind of a pair are we?

1096
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,449
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

1097
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,683
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

1098
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,486
Fight a what?

1099
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,967
Who are you people?

1100
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,087
What is this place?

1101
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,241
Gamora, let her go!

1102
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,448
The bodies in the caverns... Who are they?

1103
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,921
You are scared.

1104
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,330
I call it the Expansion.

1105
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:15,762
It is my purpose...

1106
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,447
and now it is yours as well.

1107
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,765
It's beautiful.

1108
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,287
Over thousands of years...

1109
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,603
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...

1110
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,491
on thousands of worlds.

1111
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,440
I need to fulfill life's one true purpose...

1112
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,489
To grow and spread...

1113
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,769
covering all that exists...

1114
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,010
until everything is...

1115
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,401
Me!

1116
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,441
What did she do to me?

1117
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,244
She already told me everything.

1118
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,971
I only had one problem.

1119
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,680
A single Celestial doesn't have enough power

1120
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,728
for such an enterprise.

1121
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,008
But two Celestials...

1122
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,482
Well, now, that just might do.

1123
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,605
The bodies...

1124
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,647
are his children.

1125
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,406
Out of all my labors...

1126
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,809
the most beguiling was...

1127
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,368
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1128
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,444
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...

1129
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,443
to power the Expansion.

1130
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,046
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.

1131
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,602
It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...

1132
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,526
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1133
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,251
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1134
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,728
But one after the other, they failed me.

1135
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,726
Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.

1136
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,041
Until you, Peter.

1137
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,931
Out of all my spawn...

1138
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,205
only you carried the connection to the light.

1139
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,250
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1140
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,006
Ego will have won him to his side by now.

1141
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,611
- Then we just go.
- No!

1142
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,041
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...

1143
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,362
is yell at each other. You are not friends.

1144
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,885
You're right.

1145
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,447
We're family.

1146
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,885
We leave no one behind.

1147
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,646
Except maybe you.

1148
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,730
Oh, my God.

1149
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,522
For the first time in my existence...

1150
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,604
I am truly not alone!

1151
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,321
What is it, son?

1152
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,841
My friends.

1153
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:46,250
You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1154
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,561
Yes.

1155
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,923
We are beyond such things.

1156
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,081
Yes.

1157
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,640
- Now...
- But my mother...

1158
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,921
You said you loved my mother.

1159
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,605
And that I did.

1160
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,721
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1161
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,205
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

1162
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,886
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1163
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,610
I'd never leave.

1164
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,290
The Expansion...

1165
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,047
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.

1166
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,248
So, I did what I had to do.

1167
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,442
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1168
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,881
What?

1169
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,610
Now, all right...

1170
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,410
I know that sounds bad.

1171
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,887
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1172
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,610
You killed my mother!

1173
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,807
I tried...

1174
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,724
so hard...

1175
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,370
to find the form...

1176
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,921
that best suited you...

1177
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,401
and this is the thanks I get?

1178
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,601
You really need to grow up.

1179
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,090
I wanted to do this together...

1180
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,200
but I suppose you'll have to learn

1181
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,602
by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!

1182
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,004
Finally! Rocket?

1183
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,004
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

1184
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:34,369
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

1185
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,806
to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1186
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,847
Ego's unhinged.

1187
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,490
I know Get ready,

1188
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:39,926
Drop her, Kraglin.

1189
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,681
No.

1190
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,804
(LOOKING GLASS' "BRANDY

1191
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,684
My life, my love

1192
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,047
My lady is the sea

1193
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,326
Peter...

1194
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,327
this is the sea.

1195
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,401
Oh...

1196
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,204
Hey, there, jackass!

1197
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,045
What is that thing?

1198
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,403
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1199
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,925
I told you something didn't feel right.

1200
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,401
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.

1201
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,244
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1202
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,211
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1203
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,442
There is no unspoken thing.

1204
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,204
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

1205
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,490
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?

1206
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,846
We had it under control.

1207
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,327
We did not. That is only an extension...

1208
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,528
of his true self. He will be back soon.

1209
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,966
What's Smurfette doing here?

1210
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,043
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.

1211
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,440
She tried to murder me!

1212
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,602
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1213
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,040
He's not a fox.

1214
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,282
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.

1215
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,441
I am Groot.

1216
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,051
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1217
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,891
How do we kill a Celestial?

1218
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,485
There's a center to him.

1219
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,760
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

1220
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,046
Some sort of protective shell.

1221
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,527
It's in the caverns...

1222
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,681
below the surface.

1223
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,885
Yondu?

1224
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,686
Thrusters are out.

1225
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,083
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.

1226
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,083
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.

1227
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,646
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?

1228
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,205
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

1229
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,042
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...

1230
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,804
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1231
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,564
You said you were gonna eat me.

1232
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,131
That was being funny!

1233
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,166
Not to me!

1234
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,560
You people have issues.

1235
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,449
Of course I have issues.

1236
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,210
That's my freakin' father!

1237
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,970
Thrusters are back up.

1238
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,722
- We should be going up!
- We can't!

1239
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,400
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.

1240
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,971
We have to kill him.

1241
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,803
Rocket!

1242
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,609
Got it!

1243
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,686
Whoo-hoo!

1244
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,723
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1245
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:40,927
I guess.

1246
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,081
Awesome!

1247
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,402
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...

1248
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,210
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1249
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,931
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1250
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,851
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

1251
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,281
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

1252
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,204
and all the animals on the planets.

1253
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,566
And the people.

1254
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,926
Meh.

1255
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,490
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

1256
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,241
Pilots...

1257
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,765
release envoy units.

1258
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,090
Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.

1259
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,041
Dive!

1260
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,370
Um... Captain?

1261
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,560
Captain?

1262
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,204
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1263
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,370
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

1264
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,727
to help destroy the universe.

1265
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,082
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1266
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,366
So, could you?

1267
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,726
A little.

1268
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,120
I made a ball.

1269
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,281
A ball?

1270
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,160
I thought as hard as I could.

1271
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,810
It was all that I could come up with.

1272
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,291
You "thought"?

1273
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,562
You think when I make this arrow fly...

1274
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,563
I use my head?

1275
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,371
Whoa.

1276
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,121
There.

1277
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,248
That's Ego's core.

1278
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,250
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1279
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,050
I got it covered.

1280
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,851
We must hurry.

1281
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,048
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1282
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,566
Keep it steady.

1283
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,008
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1284
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,760
Captain?

1285
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,207
What is it, Kraglin?

1286
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,328
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?

1287
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,803
- Yeah, why?
- Uh...

1288
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,286
Oh, hell!

1289
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,484
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1290
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,649
They blew out the generator.

1291
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,610
I think I packed a small detonator.

1292
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,330
A detonator is worthless without explosives.

1293
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,970
Well, we got these.

1294
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,768
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1295
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,849
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...

1296
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,684
throughout his entire nervous system.

1297
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,642
Meaning what?

1298
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,365
The entire planet will explode.

1299
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,965
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1300
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,724
I rigged a timer.

1301
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,761
Go!

1302
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,689
He's coming.

1303
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,849
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?

1304
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,761
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1305
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,251
I can't!

1306
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,649
You don't have to believe in yourself...

1307
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,408
because I believe in you.

1308
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:20,369
Sleep!

1309
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,770
I never thought she'd be able to do it...

1310
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,161
with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.

1311
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:36,004
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1312
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:41,004
The metal's too thick.

1313
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,488
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

1314
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,927
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

1315
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,601
Well...

1316
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,243
That's a terrible idea.

1317
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,687
Which is the only kind of idea we have left.

1318
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,170
Unbelievable.

1319
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,527
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

1320
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:03,610
What a day.

1321
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:14,767
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

1322
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,081
That activates it.

1323
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,089
Then you push this button...

1324
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,329
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.

1325
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,766
Now, whatever you do...

1326
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,801
don't push this button...

1327
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,040
because that will set off
the bomb immediately

1328
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,610
and we'll all be dead.

1329
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:32,166
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1330
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,004
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1331
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,248
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

1332
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,526
- I am Groot.
- No!

1333
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,281
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

1334
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,441
Try again.

1335
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,841
Hmm...

1336
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,244
- I am Groot.
- Mmm-hmm.

1337
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,562
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1338
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,642
I am Groot.

1339
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,643
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1340
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,404
How is that even possible?

1341
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,801
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1342
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,041
Point to it.

1343
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,122
No!

1344
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,284
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1345
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,204
Shut up and get me some tape!

1346
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,725
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1347
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,644
I wanna put some tape over the death button.

1348
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,690
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1349
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:11,525
Yo, Yondu... Ow!

1350
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,802
Do you have any tape?

1351
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:19,169
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1352
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,367
Tape!

1353
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,966
Never mind. Ow!

1354
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,400
Drax, do you have any tape?

1355
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,165
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1356
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,408
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,

1357
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,010
if you don't have any?

1358
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,240
Nobody has any tape!

1359
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:36,771
Not a single person has tape?

1360
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,161
Nope!

1361
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,486
Did you ask Nebula?

1362
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,043
Yes!

1363
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:42,526
Are you sure?

1364
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,011
I asked Yondu...

1365
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,320
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!

1366
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,448
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1367
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,081
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1368
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,767
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1369
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,440
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1370
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,046
Whee!

1371
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,723
We're all gonna die.

1372
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,568
Rear thrusters are out again!

1373
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,485
We're done for without that generator!

1374
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,080
Guardians...

1375
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,564
perhaps it will provide you solace...

1376
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:32,326
that your deaths are not without purpose.

1377
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,450
They will serve as a warning...

1378
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,001
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

1379
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,330
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1380
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,161
This is gonna hurt.

1381
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,845
Promises, promises.

1382
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,088
Hey!

1383
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:10,921
No!

1384
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,648
No! No! No!

1385
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,042
We're gonna blow!

1386
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,323
Peter! No!

1387
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,048
What?

1388
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,562
You look like Mary Poppins.

1389
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,131
Is he cool?

1390
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,570
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1391
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,209
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1392
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:27,608
Mantis, look out!

1393
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,324
She's just unconscious.

1394
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,930
How long until the bomb goes off?

1395
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:01,447
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1396
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,761
about six minutes.

1397
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,326
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

1398
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,481
T-minus five minutes.

1399
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:12,801
Aye, Captain.

1400
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,523
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

1401
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,365
Drax, take Mantis.

1402
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,526
Ow! My nipples!

1403
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,406
Gamora!

1404
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,767
Peter!

1405
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,411
Get over it.

1406
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:11,601
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

1407
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:18,129
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1408
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,680
Yeah!

1409
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,401
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1410
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,163
So stop pissing me off!

1411
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,970
We have to get up to the extraction point!

1412
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,161
Go!

1413
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,164
I told you...

1414
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:33,166
I don't want to do this alone.

1415
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:37,407
You cannot deny...

1416
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,844
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1417
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,809
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1418
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,961
What is that?

1419
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,927
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1420
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:17,084
Why are you destroying our chance?

1421
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,969
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.

1422
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,801
One in billions.

1423
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,400
Trillions. Even more.

1424
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,129
What greater meaning
can life possibly have to offer?

1425
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,885
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

1426
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,369
I use my heart...

1427
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:24,321
You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

1428
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:28,087
And if you don't love me now

1429
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:30,601
You will never love me again

1430
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,644
I can still hear you saying

1431
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:37,765
You would never break the chain

1432
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,883
And if you don't love me now

1433
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:42,691
You will never love me again

1434
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,604
I can still hear you saying

1435
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,565
You would never break the chain

1436
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,206
And if you don't love me now

1437
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,364
You will never love me again

1438
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,291
I can still hear you saying

1439
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,971
You would never break the chain

1440
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,564
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

1441
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:10,769
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

1442
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,810
Groot, hurry!

1443
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,722
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1444
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,365
Get to the ship!

1445
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:13,567
Not without Quill!

1446
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,889
You need to take care of the twig!

1447
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,969
Not without you!

1448
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:23,522
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

1449
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:29,008
You need to give me this.

1450
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:38,241
Uh...

1451
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,800
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1452
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,082
I only have one of each.

1453
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,970
I am Groot.

1454
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,841
What's that?

1455
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:05,770
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

1456
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,647
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

1457
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,041
Bye, twig.

1458
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:21,442
We're gonna need to have
a real discussion about your language.

1459
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,161
Where's Peter?

1460
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,968
Rocket, where is he?

1461
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,681
Rocket.

1462
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,410
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1463
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,041
Mmm...

1464
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,207
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1465
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,201
I'm sorry.

1466
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,810
I can only afford to lose one friend today.

1467
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,361
Kraglin, go!

1468
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:47,241
Wait...

1469
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,570
Is Quill back?

1470
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,526
Rocket, where's Quill?

1471
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:57,928
Rocket, where's Quill?

1472
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,320
Rocket!

1473
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,202
Where's Quill?

1474
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,323
Where's Quill?

1475
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,882
No, we need to stop it.

1476
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,087
Stop.

1477
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,450
Stop. Listen to me!

1478
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,165
You are a god.

1479
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,085
If you kill me...

1480
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,720
you'll be just like everybody else.

1481
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:35,490
What's so wrong with that?

1482
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,562
No!

1483
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,402
He may have been your father, boy,

1484
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,965
but he wasn't your daddy.

1485
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,681
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1486
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,047
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1487
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,326
What?

1488
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,081
Yondu, what are you doing?

1489
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,366
You can't.

1490
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:02,641
Yondu!

1491
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,005
No!

1492
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,522
No!

1493
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,204
Oh! Aww...

1494
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,406
No! No!

1495
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,043
Oh, no!

1496
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,370
I told Gamora...

1497
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,400
how when I was a kid I used to pretend

1498
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,289
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1499
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,806
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

1500
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,209
Earlier, it struck me...

1501
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:38,570
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

1502
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:41,447
He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...

1503
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,880
but he did have the whistle of one.

1504
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,520
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1505
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,171
and hooked up with hot women...

1506
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,288
and fought robots.

1507
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,005
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.

1508
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,241
Only it was you, Yondu.

1509
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,809
I had a pretty cool dad.

1510
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:14,451
What I'm trying to say here is...

1511
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,128
sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...

1512
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,801
it's right there by your side all along.

1513
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,769
You don't even know it.

1514
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,325
I am Groot.

1515
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,484
He did call you twig.

1516
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,251
Nebula...

1517
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,168
I was a child like you.

1518
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:59,205
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

1519
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:02,330
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

1520
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,249
I'm trying to make it right.

1521
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:05,851
There are little girls like you...

1522
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,844
across the universe who are in danger.

1523
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:13,010
You can stay with us and help them.

1524
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,967
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1525
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,208
I don't know if that's possible.

1526
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,248
You will always be my sister.

1527
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:20,368
Pete!

1528
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:26,004
Captain found this for you in a junker shop.

1529
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:29,004
Said you'd come back to the fold someday.

1530
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:31,926
What is it?

1531
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,081
It's called a Zune.

1532
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,930
It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.

1533
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:36,684
It's got 300 songs on it.

1534
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:39,127
300 songs?

1535
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,361
Wait.

1536
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,369
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

1537
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,966
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1538
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:00,725
Thanks...

1539
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:03,800
Captain.

1540
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:45,611
It's not time to make a change

1541
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:50,441
Just relax, take it easy

1542
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:54,321
You're still young, that's your fault

1543
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:57,370
There's so much you have to know

1544
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:01,730
Find a girl, settle down

1545
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:04,963
If you want you can marry

1546
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:10,530
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

1547
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:17,211
They came.

1548
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,725
What is it?

1549
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,920
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

1550
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,445
and told them what he did.

1551
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,929
It's a Ravager funeral.

1552
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,242
Yeah!

1553
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,410
Yeah!

1554
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,603
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

1555
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,364
No, he did not, son.

1556
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,805
He did not.

1557
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,803
Fare thee well, old friend.

1558
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:28,928
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.

1559
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,968
He didn't chase them away.

1560
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,246
No.

1561
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,328
Even though he yelled at them.

1562
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:41,005
And was always mean.

1563
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:45,768
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1564
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,970
Well, of course not.

1565
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,321
What?

1566
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,161
It's just...

1567
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:25,446
some unspoken thing.

1568
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,688
It's beautiful.

1569
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,366
It is.

1570
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,008
And so are you.

1571
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,240
On the inside.

1572
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,849
Now there's a way

1573
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:59,011
And I know that I have to go away

1574
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:03,200
I know I have to go

1575
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:43,441
You know, it's a shame...

1576
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:47,969
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu
to bring us all together again.

1577
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:51,329
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

1578
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,047
I'm in.

1579
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,082
Dope.

1580
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,322
I miss you guys so much!

1581
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,686
Hell, yes.

1582
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,723
What say we steal some shit?

1583
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,809
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1584
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:28,163
They are perturbed I've wasted our resources.

1585
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:35,810
When they see what I have created here...

1586
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:37,928
their wrath will dissipate.

1587
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:42,204
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1588
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:44,806
That, my child...

1589
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,809
is the next step in our evolution.

1590
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,163
More powerful, more beautiful...

1591
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:54,370
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1592
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,486
I think I shall call him...

1593
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:02,731
Adam.

1594
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,165
Ugh, dude.

1595
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:08,724
Seriously?

1596
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,803
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

1597
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,371
I am Groot.

1598
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,483
I am not boring. You're boring.

1599
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:15,482
You know what's boring?

1600
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,803
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

1601
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,567
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

1602
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,320
I'm not boring!

1603
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,481
I am Groot.

1604
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:29,640
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1605
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:07,687
In these times of hardship...

1606
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,848
just remember...

1607
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:15,530
We. Are. Groot.

1608

1614
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:31,886

1615
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:34,361
