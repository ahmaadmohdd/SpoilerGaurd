00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chris, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
I broke the satellite dish, Mom.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Now we can't watch TV!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No TV? That's like living in the 1800s!

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll just have to find other things to do.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,000
Like reading books? That's crazy talk, Lois.
